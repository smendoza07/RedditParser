    "body": "Everyone on this forum talks about how you need to be attractive to be an SB, and how there are way less SDs out there. But no one EVER brings up how you need to be wealthy to be an SD, and if they were honest all these guys would flip out over not being ATMs. Sooooo hypocritical! Also, some of the guys on SA aren't even polite or gentleman? Why aren't there a line of rich SDs out my door that are exactly my type?? My POTs always leave as soon as I start complaining about all the other shitty men \ud83d\ude2d \n\nTLDR: SDs bad, SLF hypocritical, help me???",

But I think this applies regardless of profession. A married guy with kids who's making 500k will have a variety of expenses unless he's dishonest about how much he's making, or he & his wife are cool with being frugal and he dips into savings. Some of that depends on the COL where he lives, but yeah, stuff adds up really fast. Especially if his wife and/or kids are the big spender types.",

It's time for them to eat their cake so to speak.\n\nEverything I mentioned above and more is what the wives spend the money on.  I walk my golden's by the tennis courts in the morning, & all of the courts are full at 9am mainly with MILF's & tennis pro's.  The Au Pairs take care of the kids, while the dad's are out of the driveway usually by 7am & come back at 7pm.  I golf with several of the doctors, & all of them are flat broke despite their high incomes because of the above.  Let's also not forget the $300k in student loan debt they all have also.  \n\nI live in St. Johns county Florida so not the most expensive place to live in the US.\n\nPS 100% of the time, screen your SB's you don't want an au pair from your neighborhood.  Made that mistake once, & it created a shit load of drama.  One of the doctors I golf with found out I was banging the neighbors au pair as his wife overheard his au pair talking about it with the other au pair.",

This is why I\u2019m so skeptical of all of it, even in part. A lot of SB\u2019s will describe how much they\u2019re getting and how they\u2019re living it up, but the numbers don\u2019t really support what they\u2019re saying.

And yet, its also NSA. Strange no?\n\nIts a petri dish of relationships that are both restrictive and boundless. Its very exciting, but there is more actual commitment than vanilla relationships. I doubt many SDs are actually cut out for this.\n\nI suspect Ill write more posts, but today I discovered I have a huge responsibility as a SD. Its not about me. Its about the SB.

The focus of the discussion is always what they seek and how much they can do for you. With those you talk, the rest I treat like a study case, I am curious sometimes to find out what they have inside their heads.\n\nAlso, don't panic and don't become desperate, no arrangement is always better than a bad arrangement. No allowance is worth the mental drainage, so you move immediately to the next one. Fingers crossed",

Other than the real crisis posts (assault, robbery, blackmail, miscellaneous SOS), it'd be nice if we could keep it a little cooler in the forum. Happy to hear about complaints and commiserate and put our heads together to brainstorm. But sometimes the bitter vitriol makes my eyes water here. Blocking and superciliousness and seething words...why?\n\nAfter all, shouldn't sugar be fun? Let's help each other out!

But I think this applies regardless of profession. A married guy with kids who's making 500k will have a variety of expenses unless he's dishonest about how much he's making, or he & his wife are cool with being frugal and he dips into savings. Some of that depends on the COL where he lives, but yeah, stuff adds up really fast. Especially if his wife and/or kids are the big spender types.",

I walk my golden's by the tennis courts in the morning, & all of the courts are full at 9am mainly with MILF's & tennis pro's.  The Au Pairs take care of the kids, while the dad's are out of the driveway usually by 7am & come back at 7pm.  I golf with several of the doctors, & all of them are flat broke despite their high incomes because of the above.  Let's also not forget the $300k in student loan debt they all have also.  \n\nI live in St. Johns county Florida so not the most expensive place to live in the US.\n\nPS 100% of the time, screen your SB's you don't want an au pair from your neighborhood.  Made that mistake once, & it created a shit load of drama.  One of the doctors I golf with found out I was banging the neighbors au pair as his wife overheard his au pair talking about it with the other au pair.",

And it\u2019s at the level the OP is highlighting about where the SD has to shop wisely, use flyer miles, and a hundred too much on what you say your PPM is can make all the difference. \n\nAt 30k it\u2019s still a comparison with \u201cthe market\u201d when the SD is shopping for a SB that gives him the \u201cbest bang for his buck\u201d vs the classic SD ideal figure who chooses based on what he wants (not what he can afford). \n\n90% of SDs are the 30K bunch you talk about. The OP is saying mostly everyone seems to be happy with that on this forum, but it\u2019s not the fantasy you go in with. I agree.",

But I think this applies regardless of profession. A married guy with kids who's making 500k will have a variety of expenses unless he's dishonest about how much he's making, or he & his wife are cool with being frugal and he dips into savings. Some of that depends on the COL where he lives, but yeah, stuff adds up really fast. Especially if his wife and/or kids are the big spender types.",

This is why I\u2019m so skeptical of all of it, even in part. A lot of SB\u2019s will describe how much they\u2019re getting and how they\u2019re living it up, but the numbers don\u2019t really support what they\u2019re saying. And that was 10 years ago!\n\nSo to be an SD who can really afford it to the level that is expected, you have to be wealthy, generous, and have easily accessible disposable income",

But I think this applies regardless of profession. A married guy with kids who's making 500k will have a variety of expenses unless he's dishonest about how much he's making, or he & his wife are cool with being frugal and he dips into savings. Some of that depends on the COL where he lives, but yeah, stuff adds up really fast. Especially if his wife and/or kids are the big spender types.",

I walk my golden's by the tennis courts in the morning, & all of the courts are full at 9am mainly with MILF's & tennis pro's.  The Au Pairs take care of the kids, while the dad's are out of the driveway usually by 7am & come back at 7pm.  I golf with several of the doctors, & all of them are flat broke despite their high incomes because of the above.  Let's also not forget the $300k in student loan debt they all have also.  \n\nI live in St. Johns county Florida so not the most expensive place to live in the US.\n\nPS 100% of the time, screen your SB's you don't want an au pair from your neighborhood.  Made that mistake once, & it created a shit load of drama.  One of the doctors I golf with found out I was banging the neighbors au pair as his wife overheard his au pair talking about it with the other au pair.",

Eg food could go down a bunch, or up if he dines out a lot. :)\n\nBut you're right, if he's better at budgeting then yup he can make it work. If he's enjoying life and not good at budgeting and saving, that money can go quickly.",

A married guy with kids who's making 500k will have a variety of expenses unless he's dishonest about how much he's making, or he & his wife are cool with being frugal and he dips into savings. Some of that depends on the COL where he lives, but yeah, stuff adds up really fast. Especially if his wife and/or kids are the big spender types.",

I walk my golden's by the tennis courts in the morning, & all of the courts are full at 9am mainly with MILF's & tennis pro's.  The Au Pairs take care of the kids, while the dad's are out of the driveway usually by 7am & come back at 7pm.  I golf with several of the doctors, & all of them are flat broke despite their high incomes because of the above.  Let's also not forget the $300k in student loan debt they all have also.  \n\nI live in St. Johns county Florida so not the most expensive place to live in the US.\n\nPS 100% of the time, screen your SB's you don't want an au pair from your neighborhood.  Made that mistake once, & it created a shit load of drama.  One of the doctors I golf with found out I was banging the neighbors au pair as his wife overheard his au pair talking about it with the other au pair.",

A married guy with kids who's making 500k will have a variety of expenses unless he's dishonest about how much he's making, or he & his wife are cool with being frugal and he dips into savings. Some of that depends on the COL where he lives, but yeah, stuff adds up really fast. Especially if his wife and/or kids are the big spender types.",
