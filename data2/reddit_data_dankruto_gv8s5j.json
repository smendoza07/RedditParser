            "body": "I genuinely have a silly but substantial theory hidan may have been at one point a plot device. As in if the series never went to the direction it did and stuck with the Akatsuki for a long time or stuck with orochimaru as the main villain, hidan might as well would have ended up as a McGuffin for orochimaru's plans to become immortal. \n\nI find it hard believe that orochimaru, a man who wants to be immortal, never came across this Deadpool-esk looking bastard and didn't think \"wait wut?\" And didn't go after him.\n\nPlus there is some small evidence that the Akatsuki were supposed to have gotten a bigger role in the story; their influence in the criminal underworld, their backstories in true detail, hell even hidan and kakuzu were supposed to have gotten a bigger chapter than what they got. According to an interview with kishimoto, apparently either the editors or the producers didn't like hidan and kakuzu and literally said \"ew gross get rid of them before we lose money\". Kishimoto had to scrap a huge chunk of plot and make up something new.\n\nBasically the equivalent of taking a detour.\n\nJokes on them apparently the fans liked them enough to the point there's more fanfics about them than most of the Akatsuki from what I understand.\n\nFuck the sharingan, jashin seems to know what the fuck is up.",

His fight was one of my favorites in the series.",

The pain arc felt rushed and surprisingly short for something that ended with the death of an important character and the battle between Pain and Naruto. Than there's the war arc, Kabuto always felt like a henchmen character so him getting a mega boost was always something out of left field in my eyes, plus the edition of Madara, a bunch of characters that seemed to be more likely could have been introduced far later into the story but they were dropped on the same battlefield and how hyper specific the importance of certain characters were.\n\nMy theory is that the war arc was kishimoto's passive aggressive way of telling the editors \"I could have been the Oda of ninja but instead here's all these characters I would have introduced if it wasn't for your shitty time constraints\"\n\nBasically, Kishimoto + lack of space/control of his own story+ the editors and publishers + time constraints = all the content we got. \n\nNaruto, would have been the ninja equivalent of One Piece....",

One of my favorite parts of the war was meeting the other revived Kage from other villages, but it did seem random.

Like his immortality, or why that guy has mouths in his hands, and thread man, and paper girl. Most characters in Naruto are human. Or at least they explain they ar using some sort of jutsu or something. I'd like to learn the jutsu that turns you into paper. Thst probably makes you just as immortal as Hidan. \n\nSomeone mentioned dropped plotlines. No plotline was as dropped as the Seven Swordsman of the Mist. We meet one of them very early on back when the story was still a story and not a loose frame to have fight scenes. And then we dont see another for like 500 chapters. And hes a weird shark man with a weird living sword. Then nothing again until the war where goggles dude just shows up and kicks ass for like 3 pages before disappearing again. \n\nI would have loved to learn more about the swords, and the swordsmen. But I guess it didnt test well with audiences?",

For a while its exciting, and fresh. But after a while I just want it to be back to normal. I dont want to have to wait 100 chapters so we can see what Sasuke is now capable of. \n\nOne Piece has a big problem with this. We've now been in the post time skip era for almost as long as pre time skip. And we've still barely seen any good fights that challenge the crew. Most of the really interesting stuff happens off screen to show how much of a badass Zoro is. Instead of telling me how strong everyone is, show me.",

The pain arc felt rushed and surprisingly short for something that ended with the death of an important character and the battle between Pain and Naruto. Than there's the war arc, Kabuto always felt like a henchmen character so him getting a mega boost was always something out of left field in my eyes, plus the edition of Madara, a bunch of characters that seemed to be more likely could have been introduced far later into the story but they were dropped on the same battlefield and how hyper specific the importance of certain characters were.\n\nMy theory is that the war arc was kishimoto's passive aggressive way of telling the editors \"I could have been the Oda of ninja but instead here's all these characters I would have introduced if it wasn't for your shitty time constraints\"\n\nBasically, Kishimoto + lack of space/control of his own story+ the editors and publishers + time constraints = all the content we got. \n\nNaruto, would have been the ninja equivalent of One Piece....",

One of my favorite parts of the war was meeting the other revived Kage from other villages, but it did seem random.

We just spent hundreds of chapters, and real years, learning about all these characters. Now when you time skip we need to spend hundreds of chapters relearning what they can do. For a while its exciting, and fresh. But after a while I just want it to be back to normal. I dont want to have to wait 100 chapters so we can see what Sasuke is now capable of. \n\nOne Piece has a big problem with this. We've now been in the post time skip era for almost as long as pre time skip. And we've still barely seen any good fights that challenge the crew. Most of the really interesting stuff happens off screen to show how much of a badass Zoro is. Instead of telling me how strong everyone is, show me.",

Hiden\u2019s abilities were not overpowered, he just had a very different set of strengths and weaknesses that had to be accounted for.",

The pain arc felt rushed and surprisingly short for something that ended with the death of an important character and the battle between Pain and Naruto. Than there's the war arc, Kabuto always felt like a henchmen character so him getting a mega boost was always something out of left field in my eyes, plus the edition of Madara, a bunch of characters that seemed to be more likely could have been introduced far later into the story but they were dropped on the same battlefield and how hyper specific the importance of certain characters were.\n\nMy theory is that the war arc was kishimoto's passive aggressive way of telling the editors \"I could have been the Oda of ninja but instead here's all these characters I would have introduced if it wasn't for your shitty time constraints\"\n\nBasically, Kishimoto + lack of space/control of his own story+ the editors and publishers + time constraints = all the content we got. \n\nNaruto, would have been the ninja equivalent of One Piece....",

One of my favorite parts of the war was meeting the other revived Kage from other villages, but it did seem random.

I dont want to have to wait 100 chapters so we can see what Sasuke is now capable of. \n\nOne Piece has a big problem with this. We've now been in the post time skip era for almost as long as pre time skip. And we've still barely seen any good fights that challenge the crew. Most of the really interesting stuff happens off screen to show how much of a badass Zoro is. Instead of telling me how strong everyone is, show me.",

One of my favorite parts of the war was meeting the other revived Kage from other villages, but it did seem random. I also wish we had seen more of what the Konoha 11 could do during the war. \n\nAlso, yes to everything you said about Kabuto.",

We just spent hundreds of chapters, and real years, learning about all these characters. Now when you time skip we need to spend hundreds of chapters relearning what they can do. For a while its exciting, and fresh. But after a while I just want it to be back to normal. I dont want to have to wait 100 chapters so we can see what Sasuke is now capable of. \n\nOne Piece has a big problem with this. We've now been in the post time skip era for almost as long as pre time skip. And we've still barely seen any good fights that challenge the crew. Most of the really interesting stuff happens off screen to show how much of a badass Zoro is. Instead of telling me how strong everyone is, show me.",
