    "body": "Met a girl on seeking and we made plans for last night and today. Spent all last night shopping and was happy to because she definitely needed clothes that weren't tattered and shoes that weren't stained to hell. The plan was for her to stay the night with me in the hotel and then today we would take her car over to the shop and I would pay for the repairs that she needs.\n\nSoon as the shopping is done and it's time to go back to the hotel something magically pops up and she has to leave and blah blah blah, of course no effort is made to reschedule or anything. It's the same shit as the last girl I met up with. Huge timewasters.\n\nWhat are the red flags I'm missing in these girls? Thanks",

Maybe if you click you call an audible and continue on the night, but that shouldn't be your expectation. \n\nYou shouldn't be taking girls out, dropping hundreds on clothes before you've ironed out the terms of the agreement.

It doesn't cost money to sew minor holes or tidy up shoes. Nothing wrong with faking it too, like, just pick things that look put together but don't have to be designer or anything. \n\nMaybe do dinner meet ups first instead of shopping? I think there is something to be said for getting to know someone... regardless of the intention of the relationship. There are so many cues to be picked up on in person that are missed online.\n\nI think there is something to be said for gratitude, too. If she doesn't express any amount of gratitude or such it may be a red flag. I wish I had better advice for you. I am sorry that happened.",

At this point I'd be happy for a good conversation and after lunch cuddles before even talking about shopping.  \n\nI dont think you're foolish, I think you just have a big heart and that's nothing to be ashamed of that you tried helping these girls out.  In the long run she made the wrong decision because that car isn't going to make it much longer.  A few new outfits won't get her very far.  \n\nI think evaluate the next girls \"needs\".  I know it's not anyones place to vet what someone else needs, but sometimes it's best for you to evaluate where your money goes and see what the best investment is going to be.  What does she see as the most important thing that she needs help with in her life?  Would she rather have a few outfits to go party with her friends in or would she rather have her car fixed so she can go to school/work?  Would she rather have money towards clubbing alone or does she have a sibling she's trying to help put through private schooling?  These are theoretical questions of course, but maybe dig a little deeper and see where her values are.  If she seems superficial and like she's aimlessly wandering through life without a goal other than to get approval from her friend group or possibly seems like she might be hiding a financial issue because of drug addiction, then don't go for it.  Try to find someone with goals that you'd like to help them achieve.  And sort of ask questions to see if they give you some information that backs up those goals they state.  Like if they have a plan.  Not something like \"I'd love to goto harvard and own a benz\" but they're living in Alabama and don't have a license.  But substantial proof of mental planning, at least.\n\nSorry if this is jumbled or comes across as crude, I'm not implying that you don't already do this lol or that these women were like the examples I stated or anything, I was just theorizing worst case scenarios and I have a recent back injury and am taking muscle relaxers so it's hard to articulate what I mean exactly.",

Even in vanilla dating, if I position myself to look like all I bring to the table is money then the woman loses whatever interest she has.

Like if he's an older white guy i can totally see him looking at a young woman's fashion and calling it tattered and in poor condition. I mean....I just bought a pair of \"dirty shoes\" that literally look beat up for $650. That worn/sloppy/just rolled out of bed look is a thing. Little do you know my Lululemon leggings and slouchy sweatshirt and \"dirty shoes\" were a one thousand dollar outfit...yet I basically look homeless \ud83d\ude06. Its hard to say bc it depends on his style and background. I have dated much older men and they would def call some clothes tattered and worn looking bc they like a much different country club look. Hard to say honestly \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Listen, if some guy takes me shopping for the first or second date and gives me allowance I'm not letting them go.. unless there is something  i dont like about them that i realize during our date. Sorry but it's a possibility. Did you try asking them ? Also why do you ask them to stay at a hotel with you for the first date? I wouldnt.\n\n\n\nEdit: also definitely screen/vet them a lot better before meeting. There is something you' may be missing in the vetting process. My first SD brought me an expensive designer dress and workout clothes from lulu on top of Michelin star restaurant and xxxx allowance for our first time meeting. I didnt disappear on him.. but he told me vetted hard and other girls would message him things like \"when are we going to tiffany's\" while our convo was more mature and not entitled.",

But for me these days, before I start trying to flex and do dates you see on the Bachelor, I make sure we have had our first intimate date and we both have enjoyed it. Once that's done - and I know she will sleep with me and she knows I will deliver on the agreement, the other fun can begin.\n\nI used to do courtside seats for sports games, fancy restaurants, shopping trips, etc. Those are reserved for later and if an SB suggests the most expensive place in town for the first date, I usually opt-out or tread cautiously.",

I know that sometimes people are desperate for money and they do certain things to survive or even for just some selfish reason (like wanting new clothes or a bag or something). Even though I go to great lengths to try to make a POT comfortable (zero expectations, 100% up front and truthful, 100% clear that we are both to do ONLY what we are both comfortable with, 100% guaranteed back-out agreement for whatever reason if you're not into it at any time) sometimes someone will say one thing but then later feel differently. And that is OK. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's \"OK\" to just ditch someone, especially if you have plans. But I understand that it happens for many different reasons. And I don't think I'd ever get upset with someone if they ran off for whatever that reason might be.\n\nI don't need these relationships, I want them. I want to take care of someone who wants to take care of me in return. If they run away or ghost me or don't show up, then to me that is a good thing. It means they weren't committed to this. Or it means maybe they were literally scared to be there. Or maybe they were scammers to begin with, and in that case I am glad to have weeded them out early on.",

But you're right, it's not helping me here.\n\n> otherwise she is grossed out by you\n\nI do definitely agree and have noticed this myself. Even in vanilla dating, if I position myself to look like all I bring to the table is money then the woman loses whatever interest she has. And I think \"grossed out\" is a good way to put it, women have a good intuition for me using this as a crutch instead of being more well-rounded.\n\nI appreciate your comment, thanks.",

Assuming you are in a major metro, plenty of places where this is all a walkable affair. Less risk for you if you're afraid of getting rinsed, but feels less transactional and sketchy to your SB who doesn't know you beyond an hour M&G and likely doesn't want to immediately waltz into a hotel room.",
