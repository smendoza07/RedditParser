All those experiences and challenges she took in the process gave her tools that she uses now to shine.\n\nI remembered that clip Jaesuk gave the PD of Somin making a cameo in a drama where she is supposed to be a famous idol yet soo bad at performing, just to tease her. But, he did add at the end \u201cSomin really worked hard at various things\u201d. It's just like himself, he really struggled for years in the shadows to finally emerge in the TOP. Hardwork always pays off. Soo proud of her.\n\nEdit: wording",
