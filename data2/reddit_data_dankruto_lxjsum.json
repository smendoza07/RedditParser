Then held back up against a bloodlusted Sauske who was heavily amped by all the tailed beasts and 6 paths and the Rinnegan and only *then* did he manage to tie in battle. Man if Naruto had taken a nap and eaten a sandwich before that fight, the series would\u2019ve had a vastly different ending. Naruto could\u2019ve just slapped Sauske, dragged his ass back to the Academy and dunked his head into the toilet and been like \u201cWho\u2019s the loser now, bitch?\u201d and tell him never to pull any shit like that ever again and that would\u2019ve been that",

As he had more time with it he should've gotten better at using it efficiently. Like using less Chakra to do the same jutsu.

Remember when he fought Kinshiki whilst nerfed? Remember how easily Naruto clapped Delta and Toneri while holding back? Honestly to have a chakra pool as large as Sasuke or Naruto's(especially Naruto) you almost always have enough chakra to perform at the top of your game or at least close to it, regardless if even half of your chakra is gone or not. That's why Naruto and Sasuke struggling against fodder like Shin, Naruto getting tired at the Hokage office(which only really even seemed to be the case during the Momoshiki arc), Sasuke getting shitted on  by Urashiki(and Urashiki is weaker than Kinshiki), and other bullshit ass moments like that I never take serious. It's the fact that it's treated as canon is what gets to me too lmao, cause it obviously isn't and heavily undermines the true capabilities of many characters in general, like Konohamaru.",

Plus yes it is always on  and the reason why Navarro had both and was fine was because he was an uzamaki with a large chakra pool.\n\n He even had Urashiki steal his chakra, which had been indicated before to be quite taxing\n\n1.- He fights Urashiki, chakra gets stealed. He charges just enough to teleport out of another dimension. This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan. It is not just pure bs like a lot of people on the sub say.",

I don't keep up much with Boruto but lets think critically for a moment: if the show DIDN'T do everything you just said then it would be a repeat of the first story, and that's boring. No one wants another underdog story retold in a slightly different package. They subverted expectations by flipping it on its head and making Boruto the opposite of his father, a gifted and entitled brat. That makes for a more interesting concept. Also, no one wants to sit here and watch another protagonist learn basic shitty techniques  like substitution jutsu after the DBZ level events that ended the previous story - no one is trying to go back to square one. So yes, they expedite the process and give the current generation all these OP powers to save us all some time.",

If Naruto or sasuke got nerfed in shipuden, then u would be ok with that. U just have a problem that it happened in boruto. There's a reason the show is called \"next generations\".

Remember when he fought Kinshiki whilst nerfed? Remember how easily Naruto clapped Delta and Toneri while holding back? Honestly to have a chakra pool as large as Sasuke or Naruto's(especially Naruto) you almost always have enough chakra to perform at the top of your game or at least close to it, regardless if even half of your chakra is gone or not. That's why Naruto and Sasuke struggling against fodder like Shin, Naruto getting tired at the Hokage office(which only really even seemed to be the case during the Momoshiki arc), Sasuke getting shitted on  by Urashiki(and Urashiki is weaker than Kinshiki), and other bullshit ass moments like that I never take serious. It's the fact that it's treated as canon is what gets to me too lmao, cause it obviously isn't and heavily undermines the true capabilities of many characters in general, like Konohamaru.",

Plus yes it is always on  and the reason why Navarro had both and was fine was because he was an uzamaki with a large chakra pool.\n\n He even had Urashiki steal his chakra, which had been indicated before to be quite taxing\n\n1.- He fights Urashiki, chakra gets stealed. He charges just enough to teleport out of another dimension. This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan. It is not just pure bs like a lot of people on the sub say.",

I don't keep up much with Boruto but lets think critically for a moment: if the show DIDN'T do everything you just said then it would be a repeat of the first story, and that's boring. No one wants another underdog story retold in a slightly different package. They subverted expectations by flipping it on its head and making Boruto the opposite of his father, a gifted and entitled brat. That makes for a more interesting concept. Also, no one wants to sit here and watch another protagonist learn basic shitty techniques  like substitution jutsu after the DBZ level events that ended the previous story - no one is trying to go back to square one. So yes, they expedite the process and give the current generation all these OP powers to save us all some time.",

Then held back up against a bloodlusted Sauske who was heavily amped by all the tailed beasts and 6 paths and the Rinnegan and only *then* did he manage to tie in battle. Man if Naruto had taken a nap and eaten a sandwich before that fight, the series would\u2019ve had a vastly different ending. Naruto could\u2019ve just slapped Sauske, dragged his ass back to the Academy and dunked his head into the toilet and been like \u201cWho\u2019s the loser now, bitch?\u201d and tell him never to pull any shit like that ever again and that would\u2019ve been that",

Remember when he fought Kinshiki whilst nerfed? Remember how easily Naruto clapped Delta and Toneri while holding back? Honestly to have a chakra pool as large as Sasuke or Naruto's(especially Naruto) you almost always have enough chakra to perform at the top of your game or at least close to it, regardless if even half of your chakra is gone or not. That's why Naruto and Sasuke struggling against fodder like Shin, Naruto getting tired at the Hokage office(which only really even seemed to be the case during the Momoshiki arc), Sasuke getting shitted on  by Urashiki(and Urashiki is weaker than Kinshiki), and other bullshit ass moments like that I never take serious. It's the fact that it's treated as canon is what gets to me too lmao, cause it obviously isn't and heavily undermines the true capabilities of many characters in general, like Konohamaru.",

Plus yes it is always on  and the reason why Navarro had both and was fine was because he was an uzamaki with a large chakra pool.\n\n He even had Urashiki steal his chakra, which had been indicated before to be quite taxing\n\n1.- He fights Urashiki, chakra gets stealed. He charges just enough to teleport out of another dimension. This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan. It is not just pure bs like a lot of people on the sub say.",

Then held back up against a bloodlusted Sauske who was heavily amped by all the tailed beasts and 6 paths and the Rinnegan and only *then* did he manage to tie in battle. Man if Naruto had taken a nap and eaten a sandwich before that fight, the series would\u2019ve had a vastly different ending. Naruto could\u2019ve just slapped Sauske, dragged his ass back to the Academy and dunked his head into the toilet and been like \u201cWho\u2019s the loser now, bitch?\u201d and tell him never to pull any shit like that ever again and that would\u2019ve been that",

Remember when he fought Kinshiki whilst nerfed? Remember how easily Naruto clapped Delta and Toneri while holding back? Honestly to have a chakra pool as large as Sasuke or Naruto's(especially Naruto) you almost always have enough chakra to perform at the top of your game or at least close to it, regardless if even half of your chakra is gone or not. That's why Naruto and Sasuke struggling against fodder like Shin, Naruto getting tired at the Hokage office(which only really even seemed to be the case during the Momoshiki arc), Sasuke getting shitted on  by Urashiki(and Urashiki is weaker than Kinshiki), and other bullshit ass moments like that I never take serious. It's the fact that it's treated as canon is what gets to me too lmao, cause it obviously isn't and heavily undermines the true capabilities of many characters in general, like Konohamaru.",

Plus yes it is always on  and the reason why Navarro had both and was fine was because he was an uzamaki with a large chakra pool.\n\n He even had Urashiki steal his chakra, which had been indicated before to be quite taxing\n\n1.- He fights Urashiki, chakra gets stealed. He charges just enough to teleport out of another dimension. This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan. It is not just pure bs like a lot of people on the sub say.",

So to recap, he was fighting for 3 days straight. Fought multiple Kage+ opponents simultaneously. Fought Obito, Madara, and Kaguya back to back. Then held back up against a bloodlusted Sauske who was heavily amped by all the tailed beasts and 6 paths and the Rinnegan and only *then* did he manage to tie in battle. Man if Naruto had taken a nap and eaten a sandwich before that fight, the series would\u2019ve had a vastly different ending. Naruto could\u2019ve just slapped Sauske, dragged his ass back to the Academy and dunked his head into the toilet and been like \u201cWho\u2019s the loser now, bitch?\u201d and tell him never to pull any shit like that ever again and that would\u2019ve been that",

Remember when he fought Kinshiki whilst nerfed? Remember how easily Naruto clapped Delta and Toneri while holding back? Honestly to have a chakra pool as large as Sasuke or Naruto's(especially Naruto) you almost always have enough chakra to perform at the top of your game or at least close to it, regardless if even half of your chakra is gone or not. That's why Naruto and Sasuke struggling against fodder like Shin, Naruto getting tired at the Hokage office(which only really even seemed to be the case during the Momoshiki arc), Sasuke getting shitted on  by Urashiki(and Urashiki is weaker than Kinshiki), and other bullshit ass moments like that I never take serious. It's the fact that it's treated as canon is what gets to me too lmao, cause it obviously isn't and heavily undermines the true capabilities of many characters in general, like Konohamaru.",

Plus yes it is always on  and the reason why Navarro had both and was fine was because he was an uzamaki with a large chakra pool.\n\n He even had Urashiki steal his chakra, which had been indicated before to be quite taxing\n\n1.- He fights Urashiki, chakra gets stealed. He charges just enough to teleport out of another dimension. This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan. It is not just pure bs like a lot of people on the sub say.",

This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan. It is not just pure bs like a lot of people on the sub say.",

He charges just enough to teleport out of another dimension. This is already a lot of burden for Sasuke's body.\n\n2.- A few days (i might say 2/3 days) happen between that and Urashiki's attack to Konoha. It isn't enough for Sasuke to be on a fully well shape, that's why it keeps being talked about by Naruto.\n\n3.- He again gets his chakra steal in a very elusive moment, which was pointed out here in the sub, and this is why he yet again points out he's out of chakra once they land on the past.\n\nTo be honest, it is remarkably consistent how the producers are handling his chakra and his Rinnegan.
