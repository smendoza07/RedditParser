Since it's oil based, once it's in, it doesn't come out unless thoroughly washed, and remains easily malleable.\n\nIn that sense it's very low maintenance. You can put some in your hair, and as long as you top it up every now and again, you can keep it in your hair for weeks. Wake up in the morning, give it a brush or comb and you're good to go.\n\nYou can also go longer between washes. The oils keep your hair conditioned and soft, and as your hair already has a shine from the oil, it doesn't look dirty/greasy.",

Since it's oil based, once it's in, it doesn't come out unless thoroughly washed, and remains easily malleable.\n\nIn that sense it's very low maintenance. You can put some in your hair, and as long as you top it up every now and again, you can keep it in your hair for weeks. Wake up in the morning, give it a brush or comb and you're good to go.\n\nYou can also go longer between washes. The oils keep your hair conditioned and soft, and as your hair already has a shine from the oil, it doesn't look dirty/greasy.",
