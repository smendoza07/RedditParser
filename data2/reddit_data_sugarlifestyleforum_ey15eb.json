    "body": "So I'm in an airport bar, killing time until I fly back home after my wonderful SD flew me out for a weekend of shopping and extravagant dining experiences. Start chatting with the guy next to me (mid 30s probably), he's waiting to fly home as well and can't wait to get out of the \"awful\" city we're currently in. As he goes on about how much he dislikes the place, a particular annoyance of his comes up: The number of young girls he sees with 60 year old men is \"disturbing,\" and very condescendingly implied those girls are only there for the money. Now I'm not that secretive when it comes to my sugaring lifestyle, and felt that comment deserved an honest response. I let him know I just had a lovely weekend with my older SD, and maybe we just appreciate a man that knows how to treat us well. Both in and out of the bedroom ;) \n\nI doubt I changed his mind, but it was fun to see the look on his face when he realized I was one of those girls he thinks so poorly of. Thought some of you might get a kick out of the story, hope you're all having a lovely Sunday!",

I\u2019m in my early 30s, I\u2019ve lived in 5 countries, traveled others, volunteered for causes that have allowed me to see how different life is for others, experienced suffering and joy, and discovered that the person I thought I knew I was at 25 is not the person I am today, and in a few years time that person will likely be changed again. \n\nMost of the SDs in their 30s that I have spoken to have had a typical upbringing, gone through education, and now are focusing on their career, and there is nothing wrong with that at all. But what wisdom could this man possibly share with me? \n\nThe thing about the generation gap is that an older SD has an insight of being brought up in a world a little different to the world I was brought up in. Their parents offered them an insight from a world my parents can\u2019t.

            "body": "I was flying back from Ohio for work and my flight home was through Dallas. When I walked on the plane I saw a beautiful younger woman sitting on the aisle seat. I put my bag in front then sat two rows behind her.\n\nWhen the gates closed she reached up and buzz for an attendant. She asked how could she help her and she wanted a drink while still on the runway. She was informed they couldn't serve her until they were airborne. The woman replied that she was scared to death to fly and the only way she got there was stoned. She was freaking out. I went to my bag and gave her something that i used and told her to breath we will get there. Then i sat in my seat.\n\nTwo minutes later the woman was standing in front of me and asked is she could sit next to me. Needless to say I said yes. She sat down and we started talking trying to take her mind off flying. I asked her was she in Ohio for work or family. She leaned down and whispered in the ear that she was seeing her sugar daddy. I think she was trying to shock me. I leaned in and whispered to her that I have had three sugar babies and you have a very lucky daddy.\n\nShe pulled up the arm between us and put her head on my shoulder and I put my arm around her. The next 2:30 minutes of the flight we talked all about the bowl.She had my shirt unbuttoned and my hand was down her leggings playing with her ass.  \n\nThe other male flyers were watching us she kept telling me and I told them they were just jealous. When the flight ended way too soon we stood up and i got her bag. She leaned back and rubbed her ass against me as we waited. She walked in front of me and I held back to see her ass I has been playing with. She stopped before we got off the plane turned around threw her arms around me kissed me on my lips and said loudly \" Thank you Daddy\"\n\nWe took selfies and she gave me her number if I am ever in Dallas.  I might take her up on her offer. There aren't too many places I can share my story. You never know if the person next to you is in the bowl or not.",

I\u2019m in my early 30s, I\u2019ve lived in 5 countries, traveled others, volunteered for causes that have allowed me to see how different life is for others, experienced suffering and joy, and discovered that the person I thought I knew I was at 25 is not the person I am today, and in a few years time that person will likely be changed again. \n\nMost of the SDs in their 30s that I have spoken to have had a typical upbringing, gone through education, and now are focusing on their career, and there is nothing wrong with that at all. But what wisdom could this man possibly share with me? \n\nThe thing about the generation gap is that an older SD has an insight of being brought up in a world a little different to the world I was brought up in.
