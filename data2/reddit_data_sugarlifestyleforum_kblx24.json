From what I learned, turns out the SD to SB ratio is in favor of the SD, so it makes sense demand/supply-wise. (I didn\u2019t understand this concept due to living in a place where SDs have complained about the lack of SBs, and it seems like I\u2019m their only choice, so I am very selective.)\n\nSecondly, discretion and privacy is important. That\u2019s understandable too. If you don\u2019t have to put a lot of details or upload a photo, don\u2019t.",

If they are offering a \"low amount\" because that's \"marked\" (aka, average) - then it's not a low amount.  If they are having a low amount and claiming it's normal - well, that's just another form of scammer as far as I'm concerned.",

Do you even think things through before you post them?  \n\n> The \u201conly travel to me\u201d SD is not a considerate guy and this reeks of entitlement.\n> \n> But some SBs like to drive, will meet half way and of course that\u2019s totally different.\n> \n> Imo, It should be a discussion not a requirement.\n\nThis is the most illogical statement I've read on this sub for a while.\n\nI'm a single SD;  I'm not cheating on a wife, or having to establish certain rules of where I can or can't be seen for discretion reasons.  Which means - frankly, we are going back to my place for intimacy, hanging out, etc.  Beyond the cost of a hotel, I stay in enough hotel rooms for work.  \n\nSo that's a requirement for me.  Now - obviously it's a discussion.  And I've been the first one - on occasion, when hearing a POT's real location (and seeing they are 1 hour away, not 30 minutes) - suggest that it won't work out for logistics reasons.  \n\n> SDs that use the Market to haggle with women who ask for more then they are willing to pay are assholes 99% of the time.\n\nI 100% agree with this statement;  I'm just confused what it has to do with the topic at hand?  \n\nThere is a *huge* difference between discussions that happen on this sub, and how people speak to pots.  For example - I'll talk about 'averages', or market, as you say, here.  But do I say that to a POT?  No.  I say... I am looking for X, and can offer a Y monthly allowance a month.\n\nIf they tell me they are looking for some larger number - I say that's not what I can provide, and wish them luck.\n\nNow - I also realize SBs deal with men doing this.  I honestly don't think those are the same men on this sub.  Well, unless we have some redpill or incel refuges stumbling in here.  From what I've seen (including private discussions with other SDs on here) - virtually no one tries to haggle SBs down.  (again, talking community here, vs. the wild)",

I've had success with it, and continue to evolve it over time.  \n\n> If y\u2019all are successful as you say you are, you had to put in effort for that success.\n\nAnd one of the keys was learning where it was necessary to invest time in, and where it wasn't.  Don't work longer hours, working smarter hours.  \n\nApplying the same logic to sugaring - I put in exactly how much effort is needed to derive my success.  \n\nWhich leads us back to.  Why do very few men post profile reviews?  Because on a relative basis, it's simple for men (with a sufficient budget and average personality or above) to find an SR.  \n\nAnd if we are talking historically (ignoring the last <6 months on \nSLF, as covid has thrown everything upside down) - very few conventionally beautiful women have posted for profile reviews.

I\u2019m not going to rush it but  I\u2019m certainly not going to get taken advantage of, ever. \n\nOnce we start seeing each other the relationship develops like any other relationship.  \n\nIt either stays as a NSA/FWB or..we develop really strong feelings for each other.  \n\nI love NRE but NRE isn\u2019t love.  I never mistake the two. \n\nMy last SR lasted 3 1/2 years.  We were crazy about each other. I definitely would have spent the rest of my life with her under different circumstances.  \n\nThe rest of them were terrific relationships with awesome people based on sex & mutual respect.",

(couple of individuals, yes).\n\n> Low ball because - the \u201cMARKET\u201d\n\nThat doesn't actually make any sense - the words you stringed up together.  If they are offering a \"low amount\" because that's \"marked\" (aka, average) - then it's not a low amount.  If they are having a low amount and claiming it's normal - well, that's just another form of scammer as far as I'm concerned.",

Which means - frankly, we are going back to my place for intimacy, hanging out, etc.  Beyond the cost of a hotel, I stay in enough hotel rooms for work.  \n\nSo that's a requirement for me.  Now - obviously it's a discussion.  And I've been the first one - on occasion, when hearing a POT's real location (and seeing they are 1 hour away, not 30 minutes) - suggest that it won't work out for logistics reasons.  \n\n> SDs that use the Market to haggle with women who ask for more then they are willing to pay are assholes 99% of the time.\n\nI 100% agree with this statement;  I'm just confused what it has to do with the topic at hand?  \n\nThere is a *huge* difference between discussions that happen on this sub, and how people speak to pots.  For example - I'll talk about 'averages', or market, as you say, here.  But do I say that to a POT?  No.  I say... I am looking for X, and can offer a Y monthly allowance a month.\n\nIf they tell me they are looking for some larger number - I say that's not what I can provide, and wish them luck.\n\nNow - I also realize SBs deal with men doing this.  I honestly don't think those are the same men on this sub.  Well, unless we have some redpill or incel refuges stumbling in here.  From what I've seen (including private discussions with other SDs on here) - virtually no one tries to haggle SBs down.  (again, talking community here, vs. the wild)",

Don't work longer hours, working smarter hours.  \n\nApplying the same logic to sugaring - I put in exactly how much effort is needed to derive my success.  \n\nWhich leads us back to.  Why do very few men post profile reviews?  Because on a relative basis, it's simple for men (with a sufficient budget and average personality or above) to find an SR.  \n\nAnd if we are talking historically (ignoring the last <6 months on \nSLF, as covid has thrown everything upside down) - very few conventionally beautiful women have posted for profile reviews.

I definitely search for SDs and judge them in their content of their profile and their pics. \n\nI guess most of the time, it\u2019s the SD that looks at SB profiles and messages them and not the other way around.",

If they are having a low amount and claiming it's normal - well, that's just another form of scammer as far as I'm concerned.",

Which means - frankly, we are going back to my place for intimacy, hanging out, etc.  Beyond the cost of a hotel, I stay in enough hotel rooms for work.  \n\nSo that's a requirement for me.  Now - obviously it's a discussion.  And I've been the first one - on occasion, when hearing a POT's real location (and seeing they are 1 hour away, not 30 minutes) - suggest that it won't work out for logistics reasons.  \n\n> SDs that use the Market to haggle with women who ask for more then they are willing to pay are assholes 99% of the time.\n\nI 100% agree with this statement;  I'm just confused what it has to do with the topic at hand?  \n\nThere is a *huge* difference between discussions that happen on this sub, and how people speak to pots.  For example - I'll talk about 'averages', or market, as you say, here.  But do I say that to a POT?  No.  I say... I am looking for X, and can offer a Y monthly allowance a month.\n\nIf they tell me they are looking for some larger number - I say that's not what I can provide, and wish them luck.\n\nNow - I also realize SBs deal with men doing this.  I honestly don't think those are the same men on this sub.  Well, unless we have some redpill or incel refuges stumbling in here.  From what I've seen (including private discussions with other SDs on here) - virtually no one tries to haggle SBs down.  (again, talking community here, vs. the wild)",

Don't work longer hours, working smarter hours.  \n\nApplying the same logic to sugaring - I put in exactly how much effort is needed to derive my success.  \n\nWhich leads us back to.  Why do very few men post profile reviews?  Because on a relative basis, it's simple for men (with a sufficient budget and average personality or above) to find an SR.  \n\nAnd if we are talking historically (ignoring the last <6 months on \nSLF, as covid has thrown everything upside down) - very few conventionally beautiful women have posted for profile reviews.

Which means - frankly, we are going back to my place for intimacy, hanging out, etc.  Beyond the cost of a hotel, I stay in enough hotel rooms for work.  \n\nSo that's a requirement for me.  Now - obviously it's a discussion.  And I've been the first one - on occasion, when hearing a POT's real location (and seeing they are 1 hour away, not 30 minutes) - suggest that it won't work out for logistics reasons.  \n\n> SDs that use the Market to haggle with women who ask for more then they are willing to pay are assholes 99% of the time.\n\nI 100% agree with this statement;  I'm just confused what it has to do with the topic at hand?  \n\nThere is a *huge* difference between discussions that happen on this sub, and how people speak to pots.  For example - I'll talk about 'averages', or market, as you say, here.  But do I say that to a POT?  No.  I say... I am looking for X, and can offer a Y monthly allowance a month.\n\nIf they tell me they are looking for some larger number - I say that's not what I can provide, and wish them luck.\n\nNow - I also realize SBs deal with men doing this.  I honestly don't think those are the same men on this sub.  Well, unless we have some redpill or incel refuges stumbling in here.  From what I've seen (including private discussions with other SDs on here) - virtually no one tries to haggle SBs down.  (again, talking community here, vs. the wild)",

And they still have ample success.  \n\nI've never posted a profile review.  That doesn't mean my profile is blank/has low effort.  I've had success with it, and continue to evolve it over time.  \n\n> If y\u2019all are successful as you say you are, you had to put in effort for that success.\n\nAnd one of the keys was learning where it was necessary to invest time in, and where it wasn't.  Don't work longer hours, working smarter hours.  \n\nApplying the same logic to sugaring - I put in exactly how much effort is needed to derive my success.  \n\nWhich leads us back to.  Why do very few men post profile reviews?  Because on a relative basis, it's simple for men (with a sufficient budget and average personality or above) to find an SR.  \n\nAnd if we are talking historically (ignoring the last <6 months on \nSLF, as covid has thrown everything upside down) - very few conventionally beautiful women have posted for profile reviews.  And those that did, were typically either in the middle of nowhere, or had so many red flags it was understandable that they were struggling.",

And I've been the first one - on occasion, when hearing a POT's real location (and seeing they are 1 hour away, not 30 minutes) - suggest that it won't work out for logistics reasons.  \n\n> SDs that use the Market to haggle with women who ask for more then they are willing to pay are assholes 99% of the time.\n\nI 100% agree with this statement;  I'm just confused what it has to do with the topic at hand?  \n\nThere is a *huge* difference between discussions that happen on this sub, and how people speak to pots.  For example - I'll talk about 'averages', or market, as you say, here.  But do I say that to a POT?  No.  I say... I am looking for X, and can offer a Y monthly allowance a month.\n\nIf they tell me they are looking for some larger number - I say that's not what I can provide, and wish them luck.\n\nNow - I also realize SBs deal with men doing this.  I honestly don't think those are the same men on this sub.  Well, unless we have some redpill or incel refuges stumbling in here.  From what I've seen (including private discussions with other SDs on here) - virtually no one tries to haggle SBs down.  (again, talking community here, vs. the wild)",

Which means - frankly, we are going back to my place for intimacy, hanging out, etc.  Beyond the cost of a hotel, I stay in enough hotel rooms for work.  \n\nSo that's a requirement for me.  Now - obviously it's a discussion.  And I've been the first one - on occasion, when hearing a POT's real location (and seeing they are 1 hour away, not 30 minutes) - suggest that it won't work out for logistics reasons.  \n\n> SDs that use the Market to haggle with women who ask for more then they are willing to pay are assholes 99% of the time.\n\nI 100% agree with this statement;  I'm just confused what it has to do with the topic at hand?  \n\nThere is a *huge* difference between discussions that happen on this sub, and how people speak to pots.  For example - I'll talk about 'averages', or market, as you say, here.  But do I say that to a POT?  No.  I say... I am looking for X, and can offer a Y monthly allowance a month.\n\nIf they tell me they are looking for some larger number - I say that's not what I can provide, and wish them luck.\n\nNow - I also realize SBs deal with men doing this.  I honestly don't think those are the same men on this sub.  Well, unless we have some redpill or incel refuges stumbling in here.  From what I've seen (including private discussions with other SDs on here) - virtually no one tries to haggle SBs down.  (again, talking community here, vs. the wild)",
