    "body": "Seriously, the site is a train wreck at this point. They do nothing to take down the multitudes online only posters. They do nothing to remove the scammers. Add to it a smattering if underagers they don\u2019t seem inclined to combat and it is a waste of time.\n\nTonight, second date. First m&g at a park, we decide a dinner in at a hotel and taking things from there for a second date due to COVID. Supposed to meet at 5...get text at 455 that she was sick. Keep in mind I had ordered her dinner she requested, drove 45 minutes, and booked a hotel.\n\nThe second one was just got my laughs. Met girl in seeking she immediately invited me over so I know scam. For giggles I ask where she lives and gives me an address for a luxury apartment in an old train station. I say \u201coh you I\u2019ve in the old factory/warehouse they made lofts\u201d to which she says yes so I know now for sure she is full of it. I laugh at her and ask her to take a picture out the window to prove she lives there....she says I might have a sniper. \n\nI talked to another girl today listed as twenty but when we get to snap she says that she will be turning 18 in two weeks. She has been on seeking four months. Great job there guys...start asking for Id confirmation as shit like that gets guys out in jail.\n\nBut this is your typical interaction on the site. At best it is a waste of time and at worst it is a minefield to end up on a sex offender list.",

Same with the hotel, unless you're well established, take the \"last minute hit\" and wait until you're **sure** you need the room and pay extra that first and/or second time for the \"flexibility\" of being stood up in case.\n\nAs for the sniper... I can get not wanting to send a pic of your place, but that's a lame as shit excuse lol! \n\nAnd the underage is for sure shitty on her end, although at *least* she told you the truth before y'all met, no? So in the grand scheme of things, while it sucks and it had a HUGE potential to blow up in your face, be glad it didn't I guess!",

I also spend hours a day on it when i do have a profile. I have never had a hard time finding an SB. However, yes, I did have to weed through a ton of bullshit all of those times, and was quick to block people. I would say if I messaged a few hundred women in my locale, I would get a little under half in responses. From there send a few messages, if it was like pulling teeth I would block. So that would lower the number to say in the twenties. From there if I didn't feel a spark, connection, chemsitry, shared outlook etc... whittled down more. In the end only left with at most a handful. And from there move to text. Whittle away more to a few. Meet the woman I feel has the best chance first. M&G. Things go well. Done. I wouldn't do an M&G with just anyone. Had to get a feel of them and be able to talk to them easily before. \n\nBut yes SA is a shit show. Out of hundreds of messages I would at most have one or two M&Gs.\n\nEdit: I would also use filters in my search and filters in my messages. And more often than not I would keep my profile hidden from the search function so I wouldn't get swamped and so I only messaged women I was in to.",

If you went on any other dating site you would have an equal chance of flakes, online only, and scammers. As far as the underage thing goes, it is legal to meet up with a person under the age of 18, it is not legal to have sex with them. SA is not an escorting site. Escorting sites require ID and extensive verification. SA is just a dating site so they have no purpose verifying age and such because sex is not something that is required (even tho that\u2019s up for debate according to this forum)",

If you are a legitimate SD, with reasonable money and a decent personality, finding real SBs isn't that hard, but may require patience.",

SBs are everywhere, you just have to be yourself and be friendly with every woman you find attractive in your world. Where you work, where you go during the day, whenever....smile, eye contact and pay attention to her. The more you listen to her, the more she will feel important and valued. And she also learns about how successful you are, and if you throw in some fodder about how you are not so satisfied in your marriage, the POTs will get the hint. The non-POTs will give you advice, by contrast, so you know to not cross borders with these women. But over time, sooner or later, SHE will proposition you. I believe this because it's happened to me times. But I agree with you -- SA is a supreme waste of time and money.",

And it was worth every cent\u2014because I found her. Again.  \n\nYou\u2019re obviously too cheap, too naive, too impatient or too clueless.  Go try Established Men. Try SugarDaddyforme. Try WYP. Try finding one on your own.  Better yet, start your own website. See how well those work.....then come back to SA with some appreciation that it\u2019s the best thing going.",

I honestly think the scam is good & widespread, it's run by the cartels out of Mexico.  \n\nI had one girl I did a meet & greet with at Starbucks.  Said she needed $$ to get her shit out of hock, said no issue when do you want to kick off the arrangement.  She said in 45 days as she just had a hysterectomy.  I'm like wtf?  The whining about the money was out of hand, so just finished up the date & said I'll text when I'm home.  Blocked & moved on.\n\nStill I found 4 girls on there I liked, did a meet & greet with all of them.  3 we did a dinner date & I am keeping all 3 in the rotation as they cannot meet regularly, only 2x a month each.",

However, yes, I did have to weed through a ton of bullshit all of those times, and was quick to block people. I would say if I messaged a few hundred women in my locale, I would get a little under half in responses. From there send a few messages, if it was like pulling teeth I would block. So that would lower the number to say in the twenties. From there if I didn't feel a spark, connection, chemsitry, shared outlook etc... whittled down more. In the end only left with at most a handful. And from there move to text. Whittle away more to a few. Meet the woman I feel has the best chance first. M&G. Things go well. Done. I wouldn't do an M&G with just anyone. Had to get a feel of them and be able to talk to them easily before. \n\nBut yes SA is a shit show. Out of hundreds of messages I would at most have one or two M&Gs.\n\nEdit: I would also use filters in my search and filters in my messages. And more often than not I would keep my profile hidden from the search function so I wouldn't get swamped and so I only messaged women I was in to.",
