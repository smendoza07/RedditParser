I mean, its worse than being poor, he was a poor ORPHAN without good social structure that a family gives you. Hiruzen probably spent some time with him and got the fuck out, like \"bye bitch.\" Jiraiya rarely came to meet him. Kakshi probably didn't give a fuck as he was dealing with his own problems. And the entire village HATED, FEARED, OSTRACIZED him. Here's an episode from shippuden that portrays his loneliness accurately. Episode 480 I think.\n\nEven the kids later abandoned him when they realized what a loser(from their perspective) he was and gave in to social pressure, except shikamaru who probably just pitied him more than anything.",

I just rewatched the Gaara Retrieval arc, which is literally the first arc in Shippuden, and paused it and ranted to my sister because I realized they retconned that part of OG Naruto/his childhood (I actually thought Kishi just forgot his own timeline like a dumbass, but maybe it was a retcon? IDK).\n\nBeauase Naruto talks about how Gaara was alone a lot longer than he was, he never had anyone, and yet...according to OG Naruto, that's not true? They started adapting and opening up and actually gaining friends and stuff within, like, months of each other at best after meeting in Konoha during the Chunin Exams and Naruto changing Gaara. They were both 12 (maybe 13, timeline's screwy) at the time. Naruto had only just started to be part of Team 7 and make friends and stuff by that time, and Gaara started after that, after Naruto opened his eyes.\n\nAnother part of that that Shippuden gets wrong is, along with all that, they show Naruto as, like 8 or so (guessing, doesn't actually say, maybe younger since Gaara looks younger there, and I think they're supposed to be the same age) and say that he started gaining friends around that time (and that's when Naruto says that Gaara was alone a lot longer and stuff, the above). And again...no...that's NOT right. According to OG Naruto itself, it was when Naruto was 12-13 that he FINALLY started to be accepted and earn friends and all that. Same with Gaara.\n\nBefore that, they were both totally alone.\n\nI agree, that was...SUPER weird of a thing to change so suddenly, particularly such an integral part of who Naruto is as a character AND person, especially when you KNOW the fans are gonna pick up on that shit. lol. I just prefer to think Kishi forgot his own timeline like an idiot or else I'll get mad and be like 'Why the fuck you so incompetent?!'. LMAO!",

Minato got the job and died in a week. Hashirama left behind a huge mess and died. Tobirama died young and gave the most important position in Konoha to a teenager. Hiruzen literally built the village raising countless generations of shinobi. Minato even tells him he did a great job. Naruto's dream is to be Hokage so I'm pretty sure he admired Hiruzen greatly as well as every single person in Konoha. He didn't hold the same attitude as you guys seem to \"fuck this old man for not raising me\" he understood Hiruzen's true significance and aspired to be him.",

Also him skipping Himawari's birthday was definitely forced in - after all he's done for his friends in the previous series it doesn't make sense.\n\n\\- Agree about #5, idk why people dislike her \n\n\\- Definitely agree with #4, I really wish there was a series that expands on him and Kushina, as both seemed like fantastic characters that didn't get enough screentime. Both are like my favorite side characters.\n\n\\- #3 I agree, being too soft is what killed him\n\n\\- #2 yeah, pretty much what I was thinking\n\n\\- #1 Agreed, but in a way I like how his death is mysterious - it keeps him as a legend.",

It seems forced. They don't give enough development to the kids. As well, the adults are so much powerful it gets boring or they make one dimensional villains. \n\n-Yes, I think this should have happened with Naruto. The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Other than fanfics there's not really any way to change it now.\n\n\\- I still say that Boruto was kind of a mistake - I've never really seen any need for another series after the main conflicts have already been done and resolved - at that point it's just milking the franchise like the Simpsons.",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Don't get me wrong I am not hiruzens hater, however he could have been an amazing hokage if he would have not listened to danzo and his advicers.  \n>Just because all the clans joined the village doesn\u2019t mean they still didn\u2019t have grudges against each other.

He even created the reanimation jutsu which became the primary tool for the main villains of the show and it played a part in killing Hiruzen.\n\nYes tobirama did fuck the uchihas up, which did cause problems for the future, but hiruzen as a hokage could have fixed uchihas problems if he wouldnt have listened to danzo. As we all know everybody were always hating on the uchiha clan, then after 9tails attack everybody hated them even more, but hiruzen didnt do anything about that, he didnt trust the uchiha clan to help against the 9tails, which they gladly would have done so. And he let danzo relocate them and spy on them which literaly led to 0 results since uchiha clan didnt cause the 9tails attack and rather than appologizing to them he just shruged it under the rug like nothing happened, third hokage shouldnt have resumed his duties after minatos death, they should have either make tsunade, jirayja or shikamarus dad the hokage and all of those mentioned would have solved the uchihas problems, I mean the only thing those nibbas wanted was to be part of the village and be trusted was that so fucking hard, not to be kicked out to a fucking outskirts of the village and being spyied on.",

Since the village was expanding, it obviously needed a police force. The Uchiha had nothing to do, and no where to go. The village coincidentally needed a police force. It was administratively the best choice. I doubt the villagers would like the police force if they weren\u2019t Uchiha. It is normal for citizens to have doubts towards any police force.\n\nTobirama\u2019s Uchiha police force worked. He simply wanted to keep them in line so that another Madara isn\u2019t born.\n\nDanzo on the other hand.. he used the creation of the police force as a means to spy on them. He also prevented them from helping against the Kyuubi, purposely making the public suspicious. \n\nTobirama had good, but understandably passive aggressive, intentions. Danzo purposely acted in a way to damage their image.",

The Uchiha just lost their strongest fighter against their mortal rivals during a time where power was being delegated among officials. During that era, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to hear of Uchiha clansmen deserting the village, that their rivals built, now that they have no one to match them. Sure it\u2019s easy to anoint a new leader, but you have to remember that the Uchiha did not want a treaty with the Senju in the first place. Madara and Hashirama held all the cards. Now that Madara is out of the picture, the Senju had all the cards. Mind you, if your clansmen were literally being slaughtered on sight by the Senju, like a year ago, you wouldn\u2019t want to stay without some leverage. Leverage being: Someone who can fight the Senju Brothers. \n\nThe Police force was deemed a failure, not because of how Tobirama ran it. It was a failure because it opened up the opportunity for people like Danzo to manipulate the politics around it. It failed because Tobirama and Hashirama did not properly teach Hiruzen on village politics. Man was anointed Hokage during puberty ffs.",

And there\u2019s no way he could be living on his own as a baby or toddler, someone must have looked out for him until then.\n\nAlso, I do think Hizuen is horrible, iirc Naruto\u2019s parents didn\u2019t want Naruto\u2019s identity as the son of the 4th hokage revealed in case people came after him, but for him still be taken care of and acknowledged as a hero. The 3rd did a good job at making sure people didn\u2019t know Naruto was the 4th son, but damn did he do a horrible job at taking care of him. I realize he was the Hokage and was old, so he couldn\u2019t raise Naruto himself, but he had so much power and influence that he could have put Naruto in a much better situation, like being someone\u2019s ward, or something other than letting him fend for himself.\n\nI know this is just a fictional show, but I still feel bad that Naruto had to basically raise himself. He did have a roof over his head, and he had an allowance, but you can\u2019t expect a child to know how to budget and spend his money wisely. Or he could have made multiple impulse buys on toys and candy to fill the void of loneliness he had in his life, and in doing so he wouldn\u2019t have any money to buy food. I can\u2019t imagine how many times he might have gone to bed on an empty stomach.\n\nTherefore, fuck the 3rd Hokage. He knew damn well who Naruto\u2019s parents were and what their requests were, but only really fulfilled one.",

I mean, its worse than being poor, he was a poor ORPHAN without good social structure that a family gives you. Hiruzen probably spent some time with him and got the fuck out, like \"bye bitch.\" Jiraiya rarely came to meet him. Kakshi probably didn't give a fuck as he was dealing with his own problems. And the entire village HATED, FEARED, OSTRACIZED him. Here's an episode from shippuden that portrays his loneliness accurately. Episode 480 I think.\n\nEven the kids later abandoned him when they realized what a loser(from their perspective) he was and gave in to social pressure, except shikamaru who probably just pitied him more than anything.",

I just rewatched the Gaara Retrieval arc, which is literally the first arc in Shippuden, and paused it and ranted to my sister because I realized they retconned that part of OG Naruto/his childhood (I actually thought Kishi just forgot his own timeline like a dumbass, but maybe it was a retcon? IDK).\n\nBeauase Naruto talks about how Gaara was alone a lot longer than he was, he never had anyone, and yet...according to OG Naruto, that's not true? They started adapting and opening up and actually gaining friends and stuff within, like, months of each other at best after meeting in Konoha during the Chunin Exams and Naruto changing Gaara. They were both 12 (maybe 13, timeline's screwy) at the time. Naruto had only just started to be part of Team 7 and make friends and stuff by that time, and Gaara started after that, after Naruto opened his eyes.\n\nAnother part of that that Shippuden gets wrong is, along with all that, they show Naruto as, like 8 or so (guessing, doesn't actually say, maybe younger since Gaara looks younger there, and I think they're supposed to be the same age) and say that he started gaining friends around that time (and that's when Naruto says that Gaara was alone a lot longer and stuff, the above). And again...no...that's NOT right. According to OG Naruto itself, it was when Naruto was 12-13 that he FINALLY started to be accepted and earn friends and all that. Same with Gaara.\n\nBefore that, they were both totally alone.\n\nI agree, that was...SUPER weird of a thing to change so suddenly, particularly such an integral part of who Naruto is as a character AND person, especially when you KNOW the fans are gonna pick up on that shit. lol. I just prefer to think Kishi forgot his own timeline like an idiot or else I'll get mad and be like 'Why the fuck you so incompetent?!'. LMAO!",

Minato got the job and died in a week. Hashirama left behind a huge mess and died. Tobirama died young and gave the most important position in Konoha to a teenager. Hiruzen literally built the village raising countless generations of shinobi. Minato even tells him he did a great job. Naruto's dream is to be Hokage so I'm pretty sure he admired Hiruzen greatly as well as every single person in Konoha. He didn't hold the same attitude as you guys seem to \"fuck this old man for not raising me\" he understood Hiruzen's true significance and aspired to be him.",

The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Since it's a time of peace, they try to force drama into these situations and it feels weird. And since they're not catching up to the source material anytime soon, the anime is basically a boring shonen now.\n\n\\- Halloween with Naruto?\n\n\\- I'm okay with where Sakura is - I'm sad how she was handled, but she did have moments to shine. Other than fanfics there's not really any way to change it now.\n\n\\- I still say that Boruto was kind of a mistake - I've never really seen any need for another series after the main conflicts have already been done and resolved - at that point it's just milking the franchise like the Simpsons.",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Don't get me wrong I am not hiruzens hater, however he could have been an amazing hokage if he would have not listened to danzo and his advicers.  \n>Just because all the clans joined the village doesn\u2019t mean they still didn\u2019t have grudges against each other.

As we all know everybody were always hating on the uchiha clan, then after 9tails attack everybody hated them even more, but hiruzen didnt do anything about that, he didnt trust the uchiha clan to help against the 9tails, which they gladly would have done so. And he let danzo relocate them and spy on them which literaly led to 0 results since uchiha clan didnt cause the 9tails attack and rather than appologizing to them he just shruged it under the rug like nothing happened, third hokage shouldnt have resumed his duties after minatos death, they should have either make tsunade, jirayja or shikamarus dad the hokage and all of those mentioned would have solved the uchihas problems, I mean the only thing those nibbas wanted was to be part of the village and be trusted was that so fucking hard, not to be kicked out to a fucking outskirts of the village and being spyied on.",

Since the village was expanding, it obviously needed a police force. The Uchiha had nothing to do, and no where to go. The village coincidentally needed a police force. It was administratively the best choice. I doubt the villagers would like the police force if they weren\u2019t Uchiha. It is normal for citizens to have doubts towards any police force.\n\nTobirama\u2019s Uchiha police force worked. He simply wanted to keep them in line so that another Madara isn\u2019t born.\n\nDanzo on the other hand.. he used the creation of the police force as a means to spy on them. He also prevented them from helping against the Kyuubi, purposely making the public suspicious. \n\nTobirama had good, but understandably passive aggressive, intentions. Danzo purposely acted in a way to damage their image.",

I mean, its worse than being poor, he was a poor ORPHAN without good social structure that a family gives you. Hiruzen probably spent some time with him and got the fuck out, like \"bye bitch.\" Jiraiya rarely came to meet him. Kakshi probably didn't give a fuck as he was dealing with his own problems. And the entire village HATED, FEARED, OSTRACIZED him. Here's an episode from shippuden that portrays his loneliness accurately. Episode 480 I think.\n\nEven the kids later abandoned him when they realized what a loser(from their perspective) he was and gave in to social pressure, except shikamaru who probably just pitied him more than anything.",

I just rewatched the Gaara Retrieval arc, which is literally the first arc in Shippuden, and paused it and ranted to my sister because I realized they retconned that part of OG Naruto/his childhood (I actually thought Kishi just forgot his own timeline like a dumbass, but maybe it was a retcon? IDK).\n\nBeauase Naruto talks about how Gaara was alone a lot longer than he was, he never had anyone, and yet...according to OG Naruto, that's not true? They started adapting and opening up and actually gaining friends and stuff within, like, months of each other at best after meeting in Konoha during the Chunin Exams and Naruto changing Gaara. They were both 12 (maybe 13, timeline's screwy) at the time. Naruto had only just started to be part of Team 7 and make friends and stuff by that time, and Gaara started after that, after Naruto opened his eyes.\n\nAnother part of that that Shippuden gets wrong is, along with all that, they show Naruto as, like 8 or so (guessing, doesn't actually say, maybe younger since Gaara looks younger there, and I think they're supposed to be the same age) and say that he started gaining friends around that time (and that's when Naruto says that Gaara was alone a lot longer and stuff, the above). And again...no...that's NOT right. According to OG Naruto itself, it was when Naruto was 12-13 that he FINALLY started to be accepted and earn friends and all that. Same with Gaara.\n\nBefore that, they were both totally alone.\n\nI agree, that was...SUPER weird of a thing to change so suddenly, particularly such an integral part of who Naruto is as a character AND person, especially when you KNOW the fans are gonna pick up on that shit. lol. I just prefer to think Kishi forgot his own timeline like an idiot or else I'll get mad and be like 'Why the fuck you so incompetent?!'. LMAO!",

It's kinda in his nature to lead despite not wanting to, as seen with Team 7.\n\n\\- 7th Hokage has become bad writing - I'm happy Naruto became hokage but him skipping his ceremony for a stuffed animal was unfunny and pure bs for someone we've watched work his ass off(initially) for the position. Also him skipping Himawari's birthday was definitely forced in - after all he's done for his friends in the previous series it doesn't make sense.\n\n\\- Agree about #5, idk why people dislike her \n\n\\- Definitely agree with #4, I really wish there was a series that expands on him and Kushina, as both seemed like fantastic characters that didn't get enough screentime. Both are like my favorite side characters.\n\n\\- #3 I agree, being too soft is what killed him\n\n\\- #2 yeah, pretty much what I was thinking\n\n\\- #1 Agreed, but in a way I like how his death is mysterious - it keeps him as a legend.",

The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire.

Don't get me wrong I am not hiruzens hater, however he could have been an amazing hokage if he would have not listened to danzo and his advicers.  \n>Just because all the clans joined the village doesn\u2019t mean they still didn\u2019t have grudges against each other.

As we all know everybody were always hating on the uchiha clan, then after 9tails attack everybody hated them even more, but hiruzen didnt do anything about that, he didnt trust the uchiha clan to help against the 9tails, which they gladly would have done so. And he let danzo relocate them and spy on them which literaly led to 0 results since uchiha clan didnt cause the 9tails attack and rather than appologizing to them he just shruged it under the rug like nothing happened, third hokage shouldnt have resumed his duties after minatos death, they should have either make tsunade, jirayja or shikamarus dad the hokage and all of those mentioned would have solved the uchihas problems, I mean the only thing those nibbas wanted was to be part of the village and be trusted was that so fucking hard, not to be kicked out to a fucking outskirts of the village and being spyied on.",

He simply wanted to keep them in line so that another Madara isn\u2019t born.\n\nDanzo on the other hand.. he used the creation of the police force as a means to spy on them. He also prevented them from helping against the Kyuubi, purposely making the public suspicious. \n\nTobirama had good, but understandably passive aggressive, intentions.

I mean, its worse than being poor, he was a poor ORPHAN without good social structure that a family gives you. Hiruzen probably spent some time with him and got the fuck out, like \"bye bitch.\" Jiraiya rarely came to meet him. Kakshi probably didn't give a fuck as he was dealing with his own problems. And the entire village HATED, FEARED, OSTRACIZED him. Here's an episode from shippuden that portrays his loneliness accurately. Episode 480 I think.\n\nEven the kids later abandoned him when they realized what a loser(from their perspective) he was and gave in to social pressure, except shikamaru who probably just pitied him more than anything.",

I just rewatched the Gaara Retrieval arc, which is literally the first arc in Shippuden, and paused it and ranted to my sister because I realized they retconned that part of OG Naruto/his childhood (I actually thought Kishi just forgot his own timeline like a dumbass, but maybe it was a retcon? IDK).\n\nBeauase Naruto talks about how Gaara was alone a lot longer than he was, he never had anyone, and yet...according to OG Naruto, that's not true? They started adapting and opening up and actually gaining friends and stuff within, like, months of each other at best after meeting in Konoha during the Chunin Exams and Naruto changing Gaara. They were both 12 (maybe 13, timeline's screwy) at the time. Naruto had only just started to be part of Team 7 and make friends and stuff by that time, and Gaara started after that, after Naruto opened his eyes.\n\nAnother part of that that Shippuden gets wrong is, along with all that, they show Naruto as, like 8 or so (guessing, doesn't actually say, maybe younger since Gaara looks younger there, and I think they're supposed to be the same age) and say that he started gaining friends around that time (and that's when Naruto says that Gaara was alone a lot longer and stuff, the above). And again...no...that's NOT right. According to OG Naruto itself, it was when Naruto was 12-13 that he FINALLY started to be accepted and earn friends and all that. Same with Gaara.\n\nBefore that, they were both totally alone.\n\nI agree, that was...SUPER weird of a thing to change so suddenly, particularly such an integral part of who Naruto is as a character AND person, especially when you KNOW the fans are gonna pick up on that shit. lol. I just prefer to think Kishi forgot his own timeline like an idiot or else I'll get mad and be like 'Why the fuck you so incompetent?!'. LMAO!",

Also him skipping Himawari's birthday was definitely forced in - after all he's done for his friends in the previous series it doesn't make sense.\n\n\\- Agree about #5, idk why people dislike her \n\n\\- Definitely agree with #4, I really wish there was a series that expands on him and Kushina, as both seemed like fantastic characters that didn't get enough screentime. Both are like my favorite side characters.\n\n\\- #3 I agree, being too soft is what killed him\n\n\\- #2 yeah, pretty much what I was thinking\n\n\\- #1 Agreed, but in a way I like how his death is mysterious - it keeps him as a legend.",

The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Don't get me wrong I am not hiruzens hater, however he could have been an amazing hokage if he would have not listened to danzo and his advicers.  \n>Just because all the clans joined the village doesn\u2019t mean they still didn\u2019t have grudges against each other.

He even created the reanimation jutsu which became the primary tool for the main villains of the show and it played a part in killing Hiruzen.\n\nYes tobirama did fuck the uchihas up, which did cause problems for the future, but hiruzen as a hokage could have fixed uchihas problems if he wouldnt have listened to danzo. As we all know everybody were always hating on the uchiha clan, then after 9tails attack everybody hated them even more, but hiruzen didnt do anything about that, he didnt trust the uchiha clan to help against the 9tails, which they gladly would have done so. And he let danzo relocate them and spy on them which literaly led to 0 results since uchiha clan didnt cause the 9tails attack and rather than appologizing to them he just shruged it under the rug like nothing happened, third hokage shouldnt have resumed his duties after minatos death, they should have either make tsunade, jirayja or shikamarus dad the hokage and all of those mentioned would have solved the uchihas problems, I mean the only thing those nibbas wanted was to be part of the village and be trusted was that so fucking hard, not to be kicked out to a fucking outskirts of the village and being spyied on.",

Its funny how their reason for fucking uchihas up, that if they attack the village it will make other nations invade and cause 4th great ninja war, while nobody invaded them after the 9tails wrecked the village, or when orochimaru with sand village wrecked the village, no other nations attacked the village, BUT if uchihas would have attacked the other nations would have invaded....  \nbunch of morrons, theres no way uchiha clan could cause so much damage like the 9tails or orochimaru with sand shinobi to the village to make other nations invade or am I underestimating the uchihas?",

Since the village was expanding, it obviously needed a police force. The Uchiha had nothing to do, and no where to go. The village coincidentally needed a police force.

He also prevented them from helping against the Kyuubi, purposely making the public suspicious. \n\nTobirama had good, but understandably passive aggressive, intentions.

Sure it\u2019s easy to anoint a new leader, but you have to remember that the Uchiha did not want a treaty with the Senju in the first place. Madara and Hashirama held all the cards. Now that Madara is out of the picture, the Senju had all the cards.

Leverage being: Someone who can fight the Senju Brothers. \n\nThe Police force was deemed a failure, not because of how Tobirama ran it.

Then he goes back to his lonely sad apartment. And hiruzen only paid for his bare minimum living expenses, like rent, food etc. No toys, video games, tasty junk food etc. Basically, he couldn't buy additional stuff unless someone gifted it to him. I mean, its worse than being poor, he was a poor ORPHAN without good social structure that a family gives you. Hiruzen probably spent some time with him and got the fuck out, like \"bye bitch.\" Jiraiya rarely came to meet him. Kakshi probably didn't give a fuck as he was dealing with his own problems. And the entire village HATED, FEARED, OSTRACIZED him. Here's an episode from shippuden that portrays his loneliness accurately. Episode 480 I think.\n\nEven the kids later abandoned him when they realized what a loser(from their perspective) he was and gave in to social pressure, except shikamaru who probably just pitied him more than anything.",

Also him skipping Himawari's birthday was definitely forced in - after all he's done for his friends in the previous series it doesn't make sense.\n\n\\- Agree about #5, idk why people dislike her \n\n\\- Definitely agree with #4, I really wish there was a series that expands on him and Kushina, as both seemed like fantastic characters that didn't get enough screentime. Both are like my favorite side characters.\n\n\\- #3 I agree, being too soft is what killed him\n\n\\- #2 yeah, pretty much what I was thinking\n\n\\- #1 Agreed, but in a way I like how his death is mysterious - it keeps him as a legend.",

They don't give enough development to the kids. As well, the adults are so much powerful it gets boring or they make one dimensional villains. \n\n-Yes, I think this should have happened with Naruto. The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Don't get me wrong I am not hiruzens hater, however he could have been an amazing hokage if he would have not listened to danzo and his advicers.  \n>Just because all the clans joined the village doesn\u2019t mean they still didn\u2019t have grudges against each other. The uchiha were discriminated against pretty much from the beginning.\n\nYes thats correct.  \n>Tobirama did nothing but make the hate towards the Uchiha even worse by setting them on the outskirts of the village and making them the police. The anime literally says that when the Uchiha became the military police it made everyone hate the uchiha more. He even created the reanimation jutsu which became the primary tool for the main villains of the show and it played a part in killing Hiruzen.\n\nYes tobirama did fuck the uchihas up, which did cause problems for the future, but hiruzen as a hokage could have fixed uchihas problems if he wouldnt have listened to danzo. As we all know everybody were always hating on the uchiha clan, then after 9tails attack everybody hated them even more, but hiruzen didnt do anything about that, he didnt trust the uchiha clan to help against the 9tails, which they gladly would have done so. And he let danzo relocate them and spy on them which literaly led to 0 results since uchiha clan didnt cause the 9tails attack and rather than appologizing to them he just shruged it under the rug like nothing happened, third hokage shouldnt have resumed his duties after minatos death, they should have either make tsunade, jirayja or shikamarus dad the hokage and all of those mentioned would have solved the uchihas problems, I mean the only thing those nibbas wanted was to be part of the village and be trusted was that so fucking hard, not to be kicked out to a fucking outskirts of the village and being spyied on.",

If you remember, after Madara tried to destroy the village, the Uchiha clan was displaced without their leader. They didn\u2019t have anywhere to go, but Tobirama gave them order. Since the village was expanding, it obviously needed a police force. The Uchiha had nothing to do, and no where to go. The village coincidentally needed a police force. It was administratively the best choice. I doubt the villagers would like the police force if they weren\u2019t Uchiha. It is normal for citizens to have doubts towards any police force.\n\nTobirama\u2019s Uchiha police force worked. He simply wanted to keep them in line so that another Madara isn\u2019t born.\n\nDanzo on the other hand.. he used the creation of the police force as a means to spy on them. He also prevented them from helping against the Kyuubi, purposely making the public suspicious. \n\nTobirama had good, but understandably passive aggressive, intentions. Danzo purposely acted in a way to damage their image.",

During that era, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to hear of Uchiha clansmen deserting the village, that their rivals built, now that they have no one to match them. Sure it\u2019s easy to anoint a new leader, but you have to remember that the Uchiha did not want a treaty with the Senju in the first place. Madara and Hashirama held all the cards. Now that Madara is out of the picture, the Senju had all the cards. Mind you, if your clansmen were literally being slaughtered on sight by the Senju, like a year ago, you wouldn\u2019t want to stay without some leverage. Leverage being: Someone who can fight the Senju Brothers. \n\nThe Police force was deemed a failure, not because of how Tobirama ran it. It was a failure because it opened up the opportunity for people like Danzo to manipulate the politics around it. It failed because Tobirama and Hashirama did not properly teach Hiruzen on village politics. Man was anointed Hokage during puberty ffs.",

Also him skipping Himawari's birthday was definitely forced in - after all he's done for his friends in the previous series it doesn't make sense.\n\n\\- Agree about #5, idk why people dislike her \n\n\\- Definitely agree with #4, I really wish there was a series that expands on him and Kushina, as both seemed like fantastic characters that didn't get enough screentime. Both are like my favorite side characters.\n\n\\- #3 I agree, being too soft is what killed him\n\n\\- #2 yeah, pretty much what I was thinking\n\n\\- #1 Agreed, but in a way I like how his death is mysterious - it keeps him as a legend.",

They don't give enough development to the kids. As well, the adults are so much powerful it gets boring or they make one dimensional villains. \n\n-Yes, I think this should have happened with Naruto. The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children.

Since it's a time of peace, they try to force drama into these situations and it feels weird. And since they're not catching up to the source material anytime soon, the anime is basically a boring shonen now.\n\n\\- Halloween with Naruto?\n\n\\- I'm okay with where Sakura is - I'm sad how she was handled, but she did have moments to shine. Other than fanfics there's not really any way to change it now.\n\n\\- I still say that Boruto was kind of a mistake - I've never really seen any need for another series after the main conflicts have already been done and resolved - at that point it's just milking the franchise like the Simpsons.",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

He should have had the backbone to do the right things instead of, yeah uchiha bad lets kick them out of their teritory, and lets blame them for 9tails attack even tho we have 0 proof. Its funny how their reason for fucking uchihas up, that if they attack the village it will make other nations invade and cause 4th great ninja war, while nobody invaded them after the 9tails wrecked the village, or when orochimaru with sand village wrecked the village, no other nations attacked the village, BUT if uchihas would have attacked the other nations would have invaded....  \nbunch of morrons, theres no way uchiha clan could cause so much damage like the 9tails or orochimaru with sand shinobi to the village to make other nations invade or am I underestimating the uchihas?",

The Uchiha just lost their strongest fighter against their mortal rivals during a time where power was being delegated among officials. During that era, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to hear of Uchiha clansmen deserting the village, that their rivals built, now that they have no one to match them. Sure it\u2019s easy to anoint a new leader, but you have to remember that the Uchiha did not want a treaty with the Senju in the first place. Madara and Hashirama held all the cards. Now that Madara is out of the picture, the Senju had all the cards. Mind you, if your clansmen were literally being slaughtered on sight by the Senju, like a year ago, you wouldn\u2019t want to stay without some leverage. Leverage being: Someone who can fight the Senju Brothers. \n\nThe Police force was deemed a failure, not because of how Tobirama ran it. It was a failure because it opened up the opportunity for people like Danzo to manipulate the politics around it. It failed because Tobirama and Hashirama did not properly teach Hiruzen on village politics. Man was anointed Hokage during puberty ffs.",

As well, the adults are so much powerful it gets boring or they make one dimensional villains. \n\n-Yes, I think this should have happened with Naruto. The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Its funny how their reason for fucking uchihas up, that if they attack the village it will make other nations invade and cause 4th great ninja war, while nobody invaded them after the 9tails wrecked the village, or when orochimaru with sand village wrecked the village, no other nations attacked the village, BUT if uchihas would have attacked the other nations would have invaded....  \nbunch of morrons, theres no way uchiha clan could cause so much damage like the 9tails or orochimaru with sand shinobi to the village to make other nations invade or am I underestimating the uchihas?",

Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire.

Its funny how their reason for fucking uchihas up, that if they attack the village it will make other nations invade and cause 4th great ninja war, while nobody invaded them after the 9tails wrecked the village, or when orochimaru with sand village wrecked the village, no other nations attacked the village, BUT if uchihas would have attacked the other nations would have invaded....  \nbunch of morrons, theres no way uchiha clan could cause so much damage like the 9tails or orochimaru with sand shinobi to the village to make other nations invade or am I underestimating the uchihas?",

The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people. They have a killer history, but not really as compelling as rogue shinobi.\n\n- I'll disagree slightly - Kishi HAS some pretty strong female characters(Tsunade, Kushina, Temari,...) but has no idea what to do with them. I wish he did utilize them more, because so much screentime was focused on flashbacks and Naruto being gay for Sasuke that everyone else was sidelined.\n\n- Yeah, there's less stuff and I get that it focuses on the new generation; it's just not interesting, like I could care less about Boruto trading cards. The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children.

The foreshadowing of Jiraiya and the Sage was perfectly there. I mean yes you want him to be Hokage. But I think being the Sage instead is better. And then making Tsunade or Kakashi be Hokage would be fine. \n\n-They should've did something more interesting with Sakura. Like completely revamp her to be more serious and more powerful. Hell be Kakashis right hand with Shikamaru as Hokage\n\n-I was agreeing that Sasuke should still be put doing his research for Kakashi. Kind of like the opposite of Orochimaru. Actually out doing good work. \n\n\n-And then have some chapters with Naruto and Sasuke running into each other. Have some no name become the new main character instead of force feeding the children. That way when you do the time skip for part 3, you have Naruto's kid be taught by his student (i.e the main character from the first half of part 3)",

The attachment to Boruto as the main character imo is what draws it back - everyone knows the story of their parents, but no one wants to watch a full-fledged story around their children, as they just live in their shadow.\n\nThat being said though the manga is fire. I'm glad they amped up tension from the get go and they got some cool chapters as a result.",

Honestly, I thought organized crime or daimyos were the way the series was going - I think it could've probably been a better direction for Boruto, as Boruto seems to have no direction other than weird Otsutsuki people.
