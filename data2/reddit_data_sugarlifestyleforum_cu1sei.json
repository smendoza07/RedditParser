    "body": "My SD texted me saying he wanted to go to Costco, which is super random as we are both working today. But I had a meeting cancelled so I picked him up and we went grocery shopping. While roaming the aisles of one of my favorite places I realized how incredibly happy I am in this relationship.\n\nEverything with him feels so natural since we do so many everyday/normal things together. We grocery shop, walk his dogs in the morning (if I have time that day), BBQs with his friends and more.\n\nIt\u2019s not a luxury or gift-filled SR, but I love this man and our time together. I\u2019ll cherish it while it lasts!",
