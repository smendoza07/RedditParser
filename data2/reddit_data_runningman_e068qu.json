Even more so for viewers like us - who get introduced to these celebrities on the same show. I somehow miss that with Gaki no Tsukai as I usually only watch the end-of-the-year batsu game; I've often no clue about who the guests are (bless the translators for giving descriptions though <3), which, if I had, probably would've given the experience of the situations more depth and hilarity: With rm we did knew who that high-schooler store clerk was, because we know him previously from the same show.\n\nThe show has been through a couple of transformations I'd say. A major one is from, in the past, the more often occuring athletic challenges to challenges less physically straining. We all can understand why, considering the injuries caused. I think they're probably experimenting to see what works and not, and this time I think they've hit the jackpot.\n\nEither way it's evidently working and I'm personally okay with it, as long as it's in moderation, because running man is not Gaki no Tsukai. I'd rather they don't lose focus entirely of what makes running man what it is. Maybe they can transform the no-laughing theme somehow? Given that they're already doing it their own way by incorporating rewards and punishment relevant to the overall missions, but my worry is that it's probably a thin line to thread balancing ratings and a show's character.",

Was watching that and the recommended videos included the newest episode of Running Man, which Jackie was in (135). Watched it, wanted to see more, started watching an earlier batch of RM episodes, watching like 30 or so episodes leading up to 135 (what I could find online at the time). Then I found a site hosting earlier eps and it was all the way back to the beginning, while I was also watching each new episode that came out.\n\nWhat drew me to RM after watching GnT for so long was the playful interactions of the cast. All their team ups and rivalries and running jokes and themes. Running Man was a more varied form of entertainment and was a breath of fresh air as Gaki started to get more and more repetitive in the end of year specials.\n\nLike you, I know they can't run like they used to on RM, and there are Gaki-like games I'd love to see them play, but I too hope they can find and keep their own place and continue to get the support from viewers in Korea that they need to succeed.",

With new hilarious events, \u201cRunning Man\u201d is\u00a0making\u00a0headlines every week.* \n\nSomin has been trending for every episode, even during the episode where she was not recognized by the commuters her name still trending for one hour on Naver. Sechan also seems to find the right momentum now, these days even at the sight of him opening his mouth to speak also makes me going to laugh already. Well Somin and Sechan might not be in the beginning with us 9 years ago, but they definitely came when we need them the most!\n\nAnd with the great ratings that Runningman has been receiving so far, I hope it is time for a member from Runningman to win Daesang. Jaesuk and Jongkook might be the best candidate in my opinion for that",
