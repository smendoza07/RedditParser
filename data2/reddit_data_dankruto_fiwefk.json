Show literally tried to forcefully associate boruto with the old characters in the arc, which to it's credit it does write the old characters faithfully which is why I love whenever they're on screen, but this just makes boruto live in his dad's shadow.",

One could argue it's the work he have to go through but still it's Naruto we are talking about he's like one of the top2 ninja in the Naruto verse and he can't properly maintain one shadow clone.\n\nEven if it's that way wouldn't it have been better for Naruto to make the clone do the work and to attend his daughter's party himself.",

He might bury himself in his work as that distracts himself from his memories, and Sasuke is the only one alive he can relate to.",

I like it like this, for when the time comes, the contrast will be big between how nice it\u2019s been for Boruto and how bad it\u2019ll be for when everything is almost gone for him. \n\nThe show did have a different tension but that\u2019s a given with the story, I agree. Although the story is different now and we have let it go in the direction it\u2019s going. I just wish it was seasonal and they adapted off pure manga\n\nObviously they still have a police force. They stop thieves in villages and trains. They still have trade deals and all that. There\u2019s just no WAR because Naruto stopped it. It\u2019s not as bad as it was, and that\u2019s with the assumption that it will be bad later",

Boruto is more the opposite, he\u2019s born into a world where Naruto worked for everything already and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a war, about a demon fox inside of him (but he now has to worry about his karma seal), has two loving parents with a older ninja (konohamaru) acting as the older brother.

Show literally tried to forcefully associate boruto with the old characters in the arc, which to it's credit it does write the old characters faithfully which is why I love whenever they're on screen, but this just makes boruto live in his dad's shadow.",

They have to show us what Naruto worked for them just fuck it all up with the dark shit so that dark shit can take affect on us more. I like it like this, for when the time comes, the contrast will be big between how nice it\u2019s been for Boruto and how bad it\u2019ll be for when everything is almost gone for him. \n\nThe show did have a different tension but that\u2019s a given with the story, I agree. Although the story is different now and we have let it go in the direction it\u2019s going. I just wish it was seasonal and they adapted off pure manga\n\nObviously they still have a police force. They stop thieves in villages and trains. They still have trade deals and all that. There\u2019s just no WAR because Naruto stopped it. It\u2019s not as bad as it was, and that\u2019s with the assumption that it will be bad later",

Boruto is more the opposite, he\u2019s born into a world where Naruto worked for everything already and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a war, about a demon fox inside of him (but he now has to worry about his karma seal), has two loving parents with a older ninja (konohamaru) acting as the older brother.

Show literally tried to forcefully associate boruto with the old characters in the arc, which to it's credit it does write the old characters faithfully which is why I love whenever they're on screen, but this just makes boruto live in his dad's shadow.",

I like it like this, for when the time comes, the contrast will be big between how nice it\u2019s been for Boruto and how bad it\u2019ll be for when everything is almost gone for him. \n\nThe show did have a different tension but that\u2019s a given with the story, I agree. Although the story is different now and we have let it go in the direction it\u2019s going. I just wish it was seasonal and they adapted off pure manga\n\nObviously they still have a police force. They stop thieves in villages and trains. They still have trade deals and all that. There\u2019s just no WAR because Naruto stopped it. It\u2019s not as bad as it was, and that\u2019s with the assumption that it will be bad later",

Boruto is more the opposite, he\u2019s born into a world where Naruto worked for everything already and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a war, about a demon fox inside of him (but he now has to worry about his karma seal), has two loving parents with a older ninja (konohamaru) acting as the older brother.

They have to show us what Naruto worked for them just fuck it all up with the dark shit so that dark shit can take affect on us more. I like it like this, for when the time comes, the contrast will be big between how nice it\u2019s been for Boruto and how bad it\u2019ll be for when everything is almost gone for him. \n\nThe show did have a different tension but that\u2019s a given with the story, I agree. Although the story is different now and we have let it go in the direction it\u2019s going. I just wish it was seasonal and they adapted off pure manga\n\nObviously they still have a police force. They stop thieves in villages and trains. They still have trade deals and all that. There\u2019s just no WAR because Naruto stopped it. It\u2019s not as bad as it was, and that\u2019s with the assumption that it will be bad later",

Shippunden was so much darker than OG even if OG had some dark moments but like I said Naruto was born into a world with a darker life set out but he had to overcome dark to see light. Boruto is more the opposite, he\u2019s born into a world where Naruto worked for everything already and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a war, about a demon fox inside of him (but he now has to worry about his karma seal), has two loving parents with a older ninja (konohamaru) acting as the older brother. It\u2019s not going to be as dark as Naruto and that\u2019s just where the story is at, like I said I wish they would make it seasonal and just adapted only off the manga but we went through fillers with Naruto so we going through it again here",

He might bury himself in his work as that distracts himself from his memories, and Sasuke is the only one alive he can relate to.",
