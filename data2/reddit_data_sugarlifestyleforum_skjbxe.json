    "body": "I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping her in the future as well as the present.  These are things I do or would like to do on top of our regular arrangement, for example:\n\n\\- Show her how to set up an investment account and give her some initial funding. Add a bit to it every month.\n\n\\- Hook her up with (and fund) a career coaching service to help navigate a career transition.\n\n\\- Tuition, gym membership, etc.\n\n\\- Help her learn to drive (it doesn't have to be financial)\n\nIt's not entirely selfless. I like the idea of her remembering a positive impact I had after I'm gone. Not dead, I mean after we eventually part ways (though I guess dead would work too lol).\n\nSBs, what are some ways your SD has helped your future self?\n\nSDs, do you have other ideas in the same vein?",

The 7 year relationship I put thru college and law school, smartest person I have ever met, and she is now my personal attorney. The 3 and 5 I helped get their BAs. They were all live in arrangements as well, so I told them to invest their allowance for the future, since I took care of daily expenses, and they knew how to get me to buy them anything special they wanted, lol. \n\nI do this because a good friend of mine, a wonderful woman who was the SB of a friend of mine, spent 10 years with him, actually believed at some point he was going to leave his wife and kids, and left the relationship worse off than when she went in because she had no money saved and a decade long job gap on her resume. \n\nI just don\u2019t have it in me to let someone into my life for years and then completely turn my back on them, I want to know they are not only okay, but better people for having spent a portion of their life with me. Also, proud to say I am still friends with all of them, and it may sound a little strange, but gave one away at her wedding (no, husband only thought I was a family friend that mentored her). \n\nAgain, these were long term relationships, not just a few weeks or months, but years, and they lived with me as my girlfriend as far as anyone knew. If you can do that, and not want to make sure the person you are with is better from it, something is deeply wrong with you as a person.",

Taught her how to talk to air traffic control while I flew.\n\nIronically some of the SBs here would have labeled me splenda or worse as I never just paid a monthly allowance.  I am very very confident that all I contributed over 4 years is well more valuable than 48 months at $xx per month.  She will be a legit millionaire on her own later in life just due to good investments and time (30 year career).\n\nA good SD (REAL SD) always makes a positive impact and in the end the SB is better for having had the SR than not.

I also needed a crash pad as I was working in town but main home 3 hours away.  I just bought a condo, she lived there full time and I was there part time.  It worked for us.  Now the condo is just another rental property for me since we no longer need it.  \n\n\nThe main thing in my mind is be honest with each other about what you need/want and see if you can help each other.

It is in an industry niche and now I'm helping her with implementation of marketing, etc. It's going really well.\n\n\\- Help them with trying new things in the bedroom. I'm into BDSM and a lot of them want to practice with someone experienced who isn't going to hurt them. I teach them how to set boundaries & control consent.\n\n\\- I'm a very fashion forward guy so my babies ask me to dress them. I buy them custom leather BDSM harnesses & accessories that can also be worn as fashion statements outside the bedroom. They each get their own little dolly set :-)\n\n\\- Paid for a non-emergency dental surgery that would become an emergency in 10 years. \"I can't date you knowing in the back of my mind you're jaw is going to fall off.

So, a lot of time we'll hang out at his hotel room, just relaxing, watching tv and getting room service.\n\nWas hanging out there when he had to do a call - he told me in advance that it was a tough negotiation, and the guy calling would try to get an emotional response. There were like five rounds of the other guy saying something like \"Listen you pussy ass bitch, we're never going for this bullshit you criminal jackasses are trying to get us to agree to, you're all assholes and I'm going to fuck your mother\" and Michael would respond with \"So, we could possibly sweeten the offer with an additional amount, but in return we'd need you to agree to ....\", followed by another round of (even worse) name calling. I've never seen anything like it, even on tv or a movie.\n\nAfter, he's like \"Look, it's just a negotiation, trying to get a deal done, but he's trying to make it emotional by calling names. You can't let it get emotional, either you're making money off of the other guy's emotional response or he's making money off of yours, which do you want to be\".

Overall, I just have seen a lot of business interactions that are interesting, and I'd never have insight into if not for spending time with older men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had a number of times where an SD or just an older guy I know for whatever reason has said \"Here's some wisdom\" and I've gotten a lot out of it, but that one stood out because I don't think that was even what he was trying to do right then.",

I actually think some SDs are doing them a disfavor by going too far helping their SBs.  Many SBs can never quit their lifestyle because they have too much access and entitlements offered by their SDs.  When they quit SR or too old to keep the whales, they end up being depressed because they learned how to live in luxury but they can't afford to live like that without access to whales.  SR is a very short shelf life.  Whenever the SD takes a SB to expensive places, it's actually he that gets the most value out of it not the SB.  Because other people will look and thinks that he's scored some trophy girl but really it's just a SB.",

I also needed a crash pad as I was working in town but main home 3 hours away.  I just bought a condo, she lived there full time and I was there part time.  It worked for us.  Now the condo is just another rental property for me since we no longer need it.  \n\n\nThe main thing in my mind is be honest with each other about what you need/want and see if you can help each other.  I get a sense of satisfaction making a positive difference for people I care about.  If I didn't want to care about the beautiful young woman in my life I would just be a John and do that lifestyle.

When they quit SR or too old to keep the whales, they end up being depressed because they learned how to live in luxury but they can't afford to live like that without access to whales.  SR is a very short shelf life.  Whenever the SD takes a SB to expensive places, it's actually he that gets the most value out of it not the SB.

I actually think some SDs are doing them a disfavor by going too far helping their SBs.

When they quit SR or too old to keep the whales, they end up being depressed because they learned how to live in luxury but they can't afford to live like that without access to whales.  SR is a very short shelf life.  Whenever the SD takes a SB to expensive places, it's actually he that gets the most value out of it not the SB.  Because other people will look and thinks that he's scored some trophy girl but really it's just a SB.",

Read this forum and you will see many ladies have multiple SD's, vanilla boyfriends etc, so what is the point for any guy to go above and beyond.\n\nThe best case scenario is for the SB to find a solid vanilla partner who can take her into her future.

Read this forum and you will see many ladies have multiple SD's, vanilla boyfriends etc, so what is the point for any guy to go above and beyond.\n\nThe best case scenario is for the SB to find a solid vanilla partner who can take her into her future.
