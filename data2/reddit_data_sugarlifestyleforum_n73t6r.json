    "body": "As someone whose been in the bowl for 20+ years now, it still astounds me how many men do NOT know how to open a conversation on SA.  \nIn the last week, I've received the following first contact messages:  \n\"Boo\" -- just that & as bad as a generic \"hello\"  \n\"Ever CUM to Dallas?\" -- are you 21?  \n\"I'm in town for 2 nights, come over tonight\" -- not an escort.  \n\"How much\" -- still not an escort  \n\"$$ a week and treat me like a king\" -- demanding much?\n\nSorry, just had to rant.  I would expect more from adults, but then again.... not too surprised.",

Then some I reach out to with a long post about who I am, my goals, and expectations, and they respond with just a \u201cHI!\u201d Lol. And some legit have a profile that says nothing more than \u201clooking for something beneficial\u201d like whoa, you don\u2019t say?? Haha\n\nLong story short, there\u2019s amazing and shitty SDs/SBs on both sides lol. People need to learn how to communicate",

However this does defy logic as why would you goto to a pay site for this when a there is free access to an abundance of escorts online.  Perhaps the men on SA have become so irritated in who is real and who is not they have diluted their words until they actually get a response (just a theory); their casting a wide net to see who is real.  I get dozens of hits weekly which takes time to sort through.  You have to really spend time because many a) joined one day and then forgot about it or weren\u2019t serious b) give you a one word message \u201chi\u201d or whatever because, like the men mentioned above, they are trying to cast a wide net, maximizing their time and odds c) they are real but become agitated if you don\u2019t move fast enough.  At any rate, I agree with both the SD and SB perspectives in this chain.  I believe the root cause is quality and accuracy of online tools designed to make our lifestyle more accessible and efficient.  Ironically, the gigabytes of data at the fingertips, loaded with folks angling for things other than SD/ SB relationships, has changed the bowl to a huge haystack with a few needles.   I think for me it\u2019s \u201cback to the future\u201d.... which means find a strip club or nice bar/ restaurant that you can frequent, find a nice girl, drop a big tip and start the conversation of SB.
