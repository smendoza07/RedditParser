    "body": "Sugaring is actually very sick and twisted. I go to one fo the top 20 universities in the nation, am a published essayist and have a very good network, but still sugar because I am a first generation student and my parents haven't done shit to get me to where I am and it's so hard for me to focus on school and maintain my grades when I have to work. I have been sugaring for the last 3 months and men think that I will compromise my morals because they see my circumstance and want to sexually exploit me, then get frustrated because I don't \"play the game\".\n\nI have been very adamant about receiving an allowance and moving to sex on my own terms and although this works for me (but barely... I just get lucky I swear), it just sucks this isn't the reality most women have. I really hit the jackpot finding a man that semi-understands my relationship with sex (naturally, I am just not very sexual, so he's been patient with me).\n\nPrincipally, I don't understand how any SD can say this style of dating isn't sex work when a lot of SDs don't care about helping you/getting to know you outside of sex. That's the sad case. SDs want to act like they're doing SBs some huge service (and call me entitled... I don't think I care because I work my ass off and anyone who knows me sees it), but they literally want prostitutes without making it \"feel\" like prostitution. Seriously... \"no professionals, no working girls\". Sir, you're paying for sex, but hate onlyfans girls. Make it make sense.\n\nHonestly, this is just a rant and I'll get over it because nothing will ever get in between me and my goals, but this is where I am right now.\n\nSide note: I will probably never go back to vanilla dating either because it just doesn't make sense for my lifestyle. In this moment, I just feel like men always want more than they put in and I don't think I would enjoy a vanilla relationship.\n\nExtra side note: I'm just annoyed because my SD called me this morning and asked me why I wasn't at the gym and I thought it was so rude (even though it is part of my morning routine to go to the gym so he wasn't super far off to ask but I stayed up late doing homework so I was so sleepy this morning).\n\nExtra extra side note: I am just sleepy so SDs/SBs, please don't take this personally. I honestly am just being a brat.\n\nEdit: this conversation is beginning to bore me. please feel free to discuss amongst yourselves, but I will not be responding anymore. i've painted a clear picture of who i am with my comments. feel free to look back and read what i said to try to understand, but i can't make it simpler than i already have. if men want to demonize me bc this point of view triggers them then i can't really help that. try therapy. not me.",

We can endeavour not to be but we always have blind spots and in particular for areas related to selfishness.\n\n- I want my SB to adore me, but not be needy and dependent\n- I want my SB to feel appreciated for who she is, but she\u2019s hot so I want to have sex with her a lot\n- I want my SB to not feel this is transactional so we\u2019re on allowance .. but if we don\u2019t see each other for a while I wonder if it\u2019s \u201cworth it\u201d\n- I want my SB to just enjoy my gifts without it being an exchange .. but if I don\u2019t get selfies or acknowledgement in response sometimes I feel shorted\n\nAll I can do is own my emotions and not put them on her other than where I think it reasonable that maybe her behaviour could be considered inconsiderate but it\u2019s not easy to navigate the same way normal relationships aren\u2019t easy to navigate",

It's so much easier to meet someone in the middle when you see that you're on level ground. BUT a lot of SDs think they're above their SBs, so they don't give their SBs this respect to let them know where they are and treat them like they're entitled when they start to experience those same, very real emotions (feeling used/unheard/unseen). At the end of the day, we're all human. We all just want to be loved, man. I get it. We're more alike than we are different. When we see each other for who we are, that is where the REAL fun begins.",

            "body": "I think you mean that the necessity to sugar to get by is sick and twisted? And I\u2019d agree completely. \n\nI also have to lol @ the American boomer dudes on here who grew up during the fat years, fucked everything for the subsequent generations, and now have the AUDACITY, the absolute weaponized lack of self and situational awareness, to blame the younger people for being born into the mess they created. No one helped you when you were young you absolute snozzberries? The entire fucking country helped you when you were young and has contorted itself into increasingly improbable shapes to compound your advantage over the course of your life. \n\nOnce again, if the average American salary had kept up with inflation it would be around 103,000. And if a standard 1 bedroom apartment rent had raised commensurately it would have gone from 300 something in the 90s to 700 something now when instead it is closer to 1400. The cost of American college tuition rose 1200 percent since the 80s, or around 9x the rate of wage increase. And you guys are expected to finance said education to get a job and be a productive member of society with predatory compound interest loans FFS. Healthcare spending per year was at 350 in the 70s to around 12k in 2019. If adjusted for inflation and calculated in 2020 dollars the increase is from 1875 to 12531. People are working more than ever, productivity is higher,  but you can\u2019t bootstrap your way out of a rigged system, not for the most part anyway. And you wonder why younger people aren\u2019t having children? They can barely pay for themselves. Millennials hold 4.6% of American wealth and 2% of that belongs to Mark Zuckerberg. When boomers were the same age they controlled 22% of the nation\u2019s wealth. They now hold 53%. \n\nYou say you don\u2019t want needy or desperate SBs but you don\u2019t think there would be less desperation if the average wage were 100 grand, apartments averaged 700 dollars a month, healthcare costs were under 2k per year, and tuition were 17k at a private school? AKA if SBs were operating under the same conditions you had in their place when adjusted for inflation? \n\nI come from a wealthy family and my dad is more than happy to take care of us so he had to issue paying for my schooling in the US, but if I\u2019d decided to stay in my home country my tuition/fees would have been around 190 dollars per semester. If I\u2019d chosen a grande \u00e9cole they would have paid ME about a thousand euros per month as they consider such scholarship to be and lead to public service.\n\nYou DARE to criticize young women swimming in the garbage dump you left them for being able to do less with it than you were? Do you criticize someone for having a weaker grip after you cut off half their fingers? You should be thankful Americans don\u2019t have guillotines.",

My friend in Chicago got the same university job at the same university and department as her mother did. She was paid 12 per hour where her mom had made 20 not adjusted for inflation - so the equivalent of 48 today.

No.\n\nBoomers as a whole statistically? [Yes.](https://businessinsider.mx/blame-boomers-for-ruining-economy-for-millennials-billionaire-says-2021-11/?r=US&IR=T)\n\n\"Why would young people feel such revolutionary fervor?

I\u2019ve been researching about sugaring for a couple of years now, and it seems ideal for me, but I\u2019ve been reluctant to join considering how big of a factor sex is.\n\nBy no means does this mean I want a platonic arrangement. But the fact that sex is expected typically after 1 or 2 platonic dates is insane to me. God forbid you try to initiate a 3rd platonic date, because now you are a rinser!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to add the fact that an arrangement is only made once sex is on the table. This doesn\u2019t mean to blow a bag on a stranger who you\u2019ve had one date with; but, you cannot argue that sugaring is not sex work when sex literally typically initiates an arrangement.\n\nGlad to know there are more SBs here who are stern about how they go about sugaring. Really gives me hope for when I join the bowl. Again, thank you for this post!",

This Reddit place is but a small fraction of the real word bc the real, traditional sugar arrangements are rarely represented here. \n\nmany people feel there is some sugar gospel bible thumping on this Reddit sub where this ridiculous idea that there are only 1-2 dates until intimacy should be law. Just no. That is NOT true. I always waited longer than two dates for even a kiss. And much MUCH longer for anything more intimate. And all those type situations ended up being very long lasting arrangements. I didn\u2019t read Reddit back then so I always did what worked for me. And vetting patiently to get to know the guy and his real intentions is smart for us ladies, in any dating context. Don\u2019t let anon Reddit dudes tell you how to operate within your moral compass and boundary preferences. \n\nIf you want to weed out the men who actually want to get to know you and have a long-term arrangement, then I advise to always wait much longer than than two dates for sexual activity. Men like a little mystery and chase, no matter what they claim otherwise. However, they still should be taking care of you financially once the arrangement is agreed upon or even before that to get your attention and display goodwill. This includes the getting to know you dates without sexual stuff involved. They should enjoy taking care of you financially, from the beginning and your lovely feminine energy and company is more than enough to a proper gentleman",

Is it reasonable for women to expect a lot of financial help and a high end dating experience for seen men that she would not see otherwise\u2026 of course. \n\nIs it sex work?  Do guys your age take you shopping, dinners, vacation, pay your bills, etc without you sleeping with them.  Are there any highly desirable guys that will date you for very long without having sex?  No,  because that is a key part of adult relationships.   If you break down every relationship including marriages and they are essentially sex work\u2026 or at least they begin that way.

You\u2019re giving me whiplash here.\n\nI\u2019m a great SB because I am a FRIEND. I care about my  SD past what he can offer me financially and I ask that he gives me that same respect within our intimacy. I\u2019m a multi-faceted person that can offer so much more than sex and I view him as a multi-faceted man that can offer so much more than just money. Crazy, right?\n\nIf he all of a sudden told me he\u2019s not giving me any more money, then I wouldn\u2019t change anything about what I\u2019m doing. The same way I told him I\u2019m not having sex with him and he still provides for me. The time will come. I like him, so eventually it\u2019ll happen, but I\u2019m not about to compromise my comfortability so he can feel like he\u2019s getting his \u201cmoney\u2019s worth\u201d. I can\u2019t be bought and that kills some of you men on here. It seems so odd to me.\n\nAlso, thanks for your (halfway) well wishes!",

You come on full blast against ALL SDs and then your replies are pure vitriol against anyone who fires back at you. Of course you're getting backlash and I know you knew you would before you posted, you just wanted to stir some shit.Go pick a fight outside, touch some grass. \n\nMaybe your experience isn't everyone's. Maybe not at all SDs are like the ones you attract and interact with. Maybe not all SDs are unaware that sugaring is a form of SW.

However being an empath/highly sensitive person, I would unknowingly pick up on the other persons trauma. THIS is the biggest reason why I stepped back from sugaring. It was draining me energetically. \nI\u2019ve always viewed this as sex work and think the SDs who don\u2019t view it as \u201csex work\u201d are a bit delusional. I mean\u2026the amount of pump and dumps I\u2019ve experienced is pretty far out (I would dump them or they would dump me) \nOne dude I met who\u2019s energy was so toxic that he made me sick the next day told me that how he approaches it is by being a SA member for a month and meeting as many girls as possible, sleep with all of them at a seedy motel and then find his \u201cSB\u201d at the end of the month by how sexually compatible they are. Hmmm, not sex work u say ? \nAlso a sure fire way to spread some STIs \n\nHowever- I think if approached in the right way, it can go from consensual sex work to a genuine connection/lifelong friendship.

Having the need to sugar in order to get by is sick and twisted. u/SberryTrifle already helped us hash this one out.\n2. You have very good points in this paragraph. Ladies, he's right about being paid for the m&g. I think you give very good tips. I wish you bulleted them to make them more legible, but we'll live. Thank you.\n3. I understand that sex is very important to some people, but it's not a priority for me. This is the way I vet. Maybe I'm missing out on some whales because of this, but I really don't think I am.\n4. I understand your third point and that's truly your opinion. Thank you for stating it without tearing into me. See how easy that was, boys? Also, that was a good take on why I might have that opinion, but it was more of the \"you don't give any sugar, i don't give any sugar\" kind of guys on the first date that gave me this negative ideation. The kind of guys that would want to talk about sex before they talked about interests/hobbies. Talking about an allowance was like pulling teeth for these guys. I'm not too worried about it though. I cut people off very easily when they try to give me the \"run around\".\n5. YOU are doing women a service. Sure. The men I am describing in this post are not. This is truly a rant and if it applies, then let it fly. I think it's very telling that you don't seem defensive in your comment. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's because you can't relate to any of the allegations. From what you described, I doubt your girls feel like you're not doing them justice. To be frank, men on this sub are out here feeling like they can stick their chest out for mediocre allowances and no gifts. I'm not trying to bash anyone, but come on... It's giving splenda.\n\nI would never call a man a simp because it's typically applied to gentlemen (wack), and I don't think there's anything \"simp\"-ish about tradition. Take care of your ladies... It's only right.\n\nThanks for your comment though. You need to take some of these guys to school. I wouldn't inherently expect from a man what you give because I know men like you are hard to come by in the bowl (maybe not so much where I live) but I also don't want to do this long term.\n\nI am wondering what your SBs do outside of sugaring. Do you prefer women who are live-ins? Do you have any med/law school SBs? I know different women attract a different caliber of men, but I can't help but wonder if you like this level of control over their lives? Do you want to spoil them to the point where they are co-dependent because they don't think they'll be able to live the \"high life\" anywhere else (and subsequently will never want to cut ties)? I hope you do not take these questions as attacks. This comment really piqued my interest, and I'm a naturally inquisitive person.",

                    "body": "I don't think sugaring has to be sick and twisted. I generally date older men (when I would date vanilla). I think a lot of people are making sugaring sick and twisted because they're bitter about it.\n\nIn a perfect world, sugaring would be an archetype of a real relationship where two people value each other's thoughts/emotions/goals. I don't think it's so crazy to want to get to know someone for who they are and like them enough to want to help them get to where they want to go. In turn, you both get everything you want from each other because you freely give and are open about when it's not working for you, so you can work together to fix it.\n\nI believe that some men feel like they're paying for sex and don't value theirselves for what they can offer someone outside of that realm, so that's exactly what it turns into. They don't value the women that sugar, so it turns into tit for tat.\n\nI will always believe that you attract who you are. This is just me venting/ranting. My SD has been very sweet to me. I would never act like he's been anything outside of that. Of course he gets frustrated, but he tries to understand where I'm coming from. He understands that I don't have sex in vanilla relationships this early on and we make it work. We are intimate in other ways.\n\nI can see him in my life for a very long time because of this. Honestly, I hope that he feels the same way.\n\nedited for clarity",

I just getlucky I swear)\n\nSome other guy already mentioned that, but he didn't do a very good job at explaining what he meant, so I am gonna try to do it, too.\n\nOf course I don't know what is really going on, but judging from that quoted sentence, it seems to me like you expect an allowance right out of the gate. If that's the case, think about the following: For most SDs (yes, even the genuine ones) that's at least an orange, if not a red flag. Often girls who expect an allowance right from the get go ghost after they received the first payment or try to milk the SD for all they can without ever meeting with him till he eventually gives up. A solution to that for many SDs is to do ppm first, once some basic trust is built after a few weeks or months of meeting, then it moves to allowance. Maybe you're scaring off a lot of good SDs because you insist on allowance from the get go.\n\nAlso: If you are uncomfortable having sex fast, some girls that feel the same have had good experience with explaining it to the potential SD and then doing uncompensated dates till they are ready and ppm/allowance starts with the first intimate date.\n\nJust my two cents. Good luck in your search, OP. I hope you find what you are looking for.",

This Reddit place is but a small fraction of the real word bc the real, traditional sugar arrangements are rarely represented here. \n\nmany people feel there is some sugar gospel bible thumping on this Reddit sub where this ridiculous idea that there are only 1-2 dates until intimacy should be law. Just no. That is NOT true. I always waited longer than two dates for even a kiss. And much MUCH longer for anything more intimate. And all those type situations ended up being very long lasting arrangements. I didn\u2019t read Reddit back then so I always did what worked for me. And vetting patiently to get to know the guy and his real intentions is smart for us ladies, in any dating context. Don\u2019t let anon Reddit dudes tell you how to operate within your moral compass and boundary preferences. \n\nIf you want to weed out the men who actually want to get to know you and have a long-term arrangement, then I advise to always wait much longer than than two dates for sexual activity. Men like a little mystery and chase, no matter what they claim otherwise. However, they still should be taking care of you financially once the arrangement is agreed upon or even before that to get your attention and display goodwill. This includes the getting to know you dates without sexual stuff involved. They should enjoy taking care of you financially, from the beginning and your lovely feminine energy and company is more than enough to a proper gentleman",

Crazy, right?\n\nIf he all of a sudden told me he\u2019s not giving me any more money, then I wouldn\u2019t change anything about what I\u2019m doing. The same way I told him I\u2019m not having sex with him and he still provides for me. The time will come. I like him, so eventually it\u2019ll happen, but I\u2019m not about to compromise my comfortability so he can feel like he\u2019s getting his \u201cmoney\u2019s worth\u201d.

Having the need to sugar in order to get by is sick and twisted. u/SberryTrifle already helped us hash this one out.\n2. You have very good points in this paragraph. Ladies, he's right about being paid for the m&g. I think you give very good tips. I wish you bulleted them to make them more legible, but we'll live. Thank you.\n3. I understand that sex is very important to some people, but it's not a priority for me. This is the way I vet. Maybe I'm missing out on some whales because of this, but I really don't think I am.\n4. I understand your third point and that's truly your opinion. Thank you for stating it without tearing into me. See how easy that was, boys? Also, that was a good take on why I might have that opinion, but it was more of the \"you don't give any sugar, i don't give any sugar\" kind of guys on the first date that gave me this negative ideation. The kind of guys that would want to talk about sex before they talked about interests/hobbies. Talking about an allowance was like pulling teeth for these guys. I'm not too worried about it though. I cut people off very easily when they try to give me the \"run around\".\n5. YOU are doing women a service. Sure. The men I am describing in this post are not. This is truly a rant and if it applies, then let it fly. I think it's very telling that you don't seem defensive in your comment. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's because you can't relate to any of the allegations. From what you described, I doubt your girls feel like you're not doing them justice. To be frank, men on this sub are out here feeling like they can stick their chest out for mediocre allowances and no gifts. I'm not trying to bash anyone, but come on... It's giving splenda.\n\nI would never call a man a simp because it's typically applied to gentlemen (wack), and I don't think there's anything \"simp\"-ish about tradition. Take care of your ladies... It's only right.\n\nThanks for your comment though. You need to take some of these guys to school. I wouldn't inherently expect from a man what you give because I know men like you are hard to come by in the bowl (maybe not so much where I live) but I also don't want to do this long term.\n\nI am wondering what your SBs do outside of sugaring. Do you prefer women who are live-ins? Do you have any med/law school SBs? I know different women attract a different caliber of men, but I can't help but wonder if you like this level of control over their lives? Do you want to spoil them to the point where they are co-dependent because they don't think they'll be able to live the \"high life\" anywhere else (and subsequently will never want to cut ties)? I hope you do not take these questions as attacks. This comment really piqued my interest, and I'm a naturally inquisitive person.",

Cornell and Penn only offered advanced degrees to women meaning you had to already have a bachelors degree (so therefore were older than 19). That changed with the School of Liberal Arts at Penn in 1933. And Cornell only allowed women entrance into the School of Home Economics. Harvard was also an advanced degree for Education.\n\nSo which Ivy League school did your mother attend and graduate from by the age of 19, during the Great Depression, without any help at all from anyone but her own hard work ethic?",

I think a lot of people are making sugaring sick and twisted because they're bitter about it.\n\nIn a perfect world, sugaring would be an archetype of a real relationship where two people value each other's thoughts/emotions/goals. I don't think it's so crazy to want to get to know someone for who they are and like them enough to want to help them get to where they want to go. In turn, you both get everything you want from each other because you freely give and are open about when it's not working for you, so you can work together to fix it.\n\nI believe that some men feel like they're paying for sex and don't value theirselves for what they can offer someone outside of that realm, so that's exactly what it turns into. They don't value the women that sugar, so it turns into tit for tat.\n\nI will always believe that you attract who you are. This is just me venting/ranting. My SD has been very sweet to me. I would never act like he's been anything outside of that. Of course he gets frustrated, but he tries to understand where I'm coming from. He understands that I don't have sex in vanilla relationships this early on and we make it work. We are intimate in other ways.\n\nI can see him in my life for a very long time because of this.

This is why boomers with big houses looking to downsize are having trouble getting millennials to buy their giant houses --- \"Many millennials are financially behind and can't afford a starter home, much less a big, luxury home\" there is therefore \"a lingering market for spacious homes\" in part due to \"millennials' desire to downsize\" and because \"the median home outweighed the median income by so much that it could take nearly a decade to save the 20% downpayment\" and because \"millennials are also grappling with a higher cost of living and staggering student loan debt which further delays saving for a downpayment.\" [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-not-buying-big-houses-mcmansions-real-estate-2019-8?r=MX&IR=T).\n\nIn fact, pretty much the only millennials able to live in big houses are [sharing them with roommates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/millennials-dream-of-homeownership-11633698676): \"burdened by debt and facing soaring home prices, first-time home buyers are pooling their finances with partners, friends, or roommates\"\n\nWhere are you getting your information from? Out of print children's books from the former Soviet Union?",

I think if people read through to the end and saw the \"I'm honestly just being a brat\" part, then they wouldn't be so triggered by this post. I'm only responding the way I am because people are making it personal and I think it's weird... like sir, I don't care what your mother/sister/brother/dog did in college... wtf",

Seemed to me like that's all he wanted and he just didn't want to think of himself as paying for sex. Like, what do they think an SB/SD relationship is? It's pampering SB's for their time and attention. It blows my mind. Then they have the audacity to wave their bank statments around and brag about their money but then they turn around and hold it against the girls they claim to \"want to help\" What does it take to get a decent SD?!

Cornell and Penn only offered advanced degrees to women meaning you had to already have a bachelors degree (so therefore were older than 19). That changed with the School of Liberal Arts at Penn in 1933. And Cornell only allowed women entrance into the School of Home Economics. Harvard was also an advanced degree for Education.\n\nSo which Ivy League school did your mother attend and graduate from by the age of 19, during the Great Depression, without any help at all from anyone but her own hard work ethic?",

I\u2019m a multi-faceted person that can offer so much more than sex and I view him as a multi-faceted man that can offer so much more than just money. Crazy, right?\n\nIf he all of a sudden told me he\u2019s not giving me any more money, then I wouldn\u2019t change anything about what I\u2019m doing. The same way I told him I\u2019m not having sex with him and he still provides for me. The time will come. I like him, so eventually it\u2019ll happen, but I\u2019m not about to compromise my comfortability so he can feel like he\u2019s getting his \u201cmoney\u2019s worth\u201d.

That changed with the School of Liberal Arts at Penn in 1933. And Cornell only allowed women entrance into the School of Home Economics. Harvard was also an advanced degree for Education.\n\nSo which Ivy League school did your mother attend and graduate from by the age of 19, during the Great Depression, without any help at all from anyone but her own hard work ethic?",

And, he takes care of me financially 100% regardless if we saw each other 4-5 times for the month, or not at all. Even if he was too busy to see me for a month or I happened to be out of town for the next month, he still gave all my generous monthly allowances, plus\u2019s paid living expense, CCs, trips, a few surgeries, car, plus mortgage payments in advance .
