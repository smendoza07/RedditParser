Then Obito showed up in front of them and casted a genjutsu on everyone, delaying the ANBU team that was secretly there too. Kakashi, Itachi, and Tenma resisted it. Tenma rushes in and gets killed, with gruesome detail in the novel. Itachi attacked Obito but he phased right through. Obito would have killed Itachi too if Kakashi didn\u2019t come in at the last second. Obito dipped as soon as he sensed Kakashi get closer. That\u2019s how Itachi met Kakashi for the first time in the novels. Also Shinko made it out alive and quit being a ninja.\n\nItachi actually didn\u2019t shed a single tear over Tenma\u2019s death in the novels. But his desire to get more power to avoid something like that from ever happening again did unlock his Sharingan. \n\nTLDR: Tenma ran in recklessly and Obito taught him a lesson.",

I don\u2019t think Itachi was even born yet, as Kakashi hadn\u2019t killed Rin or joined Anbu yet, which he did years before the ninetails attack and before Minato became Hokage. Itachi is only a few years older than Sasuke and Naruto, so he didn\u2019t activate his sharingan until around the time of the Ninetails. No way Madara was still moving around if he was bedridden way back when, while Obito would\u2019ve already activated Mangekyo at this point as that was before Kakashis anbu days.",

Then Obito showed up in front of them and casted a genjutsu on everyone, delaying the ANBU team that was secretly there too. Kakashi, Itachi, and Tenma resisted it. Tenma rushes in and gets killed, with gruesome detail in the novel. Itachi attacked Obito but he phased right through. Obito would have killed Itachi too if Kakashi didn\u2019t come in at the last second. Obito dipped as soon as he sensed Kakashi get closer. That\u2019s how Itachi met Kakashi for the first time in the novels. Also Shinko made it out alive and quit being a ninja.\n\nItachi actually didn\u2019t shed a single tear over Tenma\u2019s death in the novels. But his desire to get more power to avoid something like that from ever happening again did unlock his Sharingan. \n\nTLDR: Tenma ran in recklessly and Obito taught him a lesson.",

Itachi is only a few years older than Sasuke and Naruto, so he didn\u2019t activate his sharingan until around the time of the Ninetails. No way Madara was still moving around if he was bedridden way back when, while Obito would\u2019ve already activated Mangekyo at this point as that was before Kakashis anbu days.",

Then Obito showed up in front of them and casted a genjutsu on everyone, delaying the ANBU team that was secretly there too. Kakashi, Itachi, and Tenma resisted it. Tenma rushes in and gets killed, with gruesome detail in the novel. Itachi attacked Obito but he phased right through. Obito would have killed Itachi too if Kakashi didn\u2019t come in at the last second. Obito dipped as soon as he sensed Kakashi get closer. That\u2019s how Itachi met Kakashi for the first time in the novels. Also Shinko made it out alive and quit being a ninja.\n\nItachi actually didn\u2019t shed a single tear over Tenma\u2019s death in the novels. But his desire to get more power to avoid something like that from ever happening again did unlock his Sharingan. \n\nTLDR: Tenma ran in recklessly and Obito taught him a lesson.",

I don\u2019t think Itachi was even born yet, as Kakashi hadn\u2019t killed Rin or joined Anbu yet, which he did years before the ninetails attack and before Minato became Hokage. Itachi is only a few years older than Sasuke and Naruto, so he didn\u2019t activate his sharingan until around the time of the Ninetails. No way Madara was still moving around if he was bedridden way back when, while Obito would\u2019ve already activated Mangekyo at this point as that was before Kakashis anbu days.",

Then Obito showed up in front of them and casted a genjutsu on everyone, delaying the ANBU team that was secretly there too. Kakashi, Itachi, and Tenma resisted it. Tenma rushes in and gets killed, with gruesome detail in the novel. Itachi attacked Obito but he phased right through. Obito would have killed Itachi too if Kakashi didn\u2019t come in at the last second. Obito dipped as soon as he sensed Kakashi get closer. That\u2019s how Itachi met Kakashi for the first time in the novels. Also Shinko made it out alive and quit being a ninja.\n\nItachi actually didn\u2019t shed a single tear over Tenma\u2019s death in the novels. But his desire to get more power to avoid something like that from ever happening again did unlock his Sharingan. \n\nTLDR: Tenma ran in recklessly and Obito taught him a lesson.",

Itachi is only a few years older than Sasuke and Naruto, so he didn\u2019t activate his sharingan until around the time of the Ninetails. No way Madara was still moving around if he was bedridden way back when, while Obito would\u2019ve already activated Mangekyo at this point as that was before Kakashis anbu days.",
