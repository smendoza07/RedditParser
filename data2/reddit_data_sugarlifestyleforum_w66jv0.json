    "body": "I appreciate all the advice given on my last post, but he broke the news today after we hadn\u2019t spoke for two days that he had found a new SB while I was sick with covid along with bashing me for asking for extra help (half of a already low ppm) outside of the arrangement. \n\nHe said it made me look like a gold digger (I hadn\u2019t asked him for a cent extra in the YEAR we had this arrangement)\nI did include when asking if I could \u201cmake it up\u201d when I\u2019m better and don\u2019t have covid, but he has a very high sex drive and needed it then. So he dumped me. And already has another SB from what he claims.\n\nWhat I can take from this is, never ever ask for extra help outside of allowance/ppm. It has cost me the worlds best SD I thought I had. Now I am screwed. Their was never a safety net. I was always on my own, like the object I realize I am.\n\nSorry just a little rant. Can\u2019t stop crying over all this. I messed things up and it\u2019s all my fault. \ud83d\ude2d",

The lesson here is you as an SB are responsible for your own life which means to use the allowance wisely and build out a strong emergency fund that makes you depend on no one. \n\nThe way I see it is the SD always fulfilled his part of the financial obligation and is also a savvy guy who guards against sudden asks from SBs and risk being an ATM. We all know how prevalent those are in the bowl. He clearly had boundaries and respected those. \n\nWe really do not have the SDs side of the story but I wonder what he would have to say.\n\nThat\u2019s the HARSH reality of SRs. We all know that SBs are well advised not to indulge when the SD has financial problems and cannot pay regular ppm or allowance. Why should the standards be different for SDs? Imagine the SDs asking for free dates because they had a financial problem that month. Imagine the reaction from the SBs and in particular the commercial SBs.\n\nWe all know the long threads on SLF that happen when the SD missed a twenty on his allowance etc. How mercilessly the SD gets crucified for doing that. \n\nI personally respect the SD for standing hid ground",

Just hold out for someone with real kindness and actual generosity of spirit (not talking bank book - this means SO much more than that). \n\nFor him to call you Gold Digger when you asked for some support while having Covid and unable to work reveals him as the  'Pillar of Salt!' that he really is. \n\nThis guy was an SD - a SALT Daddy! ;-/ \n\nNow get out there and find a Sweet Sugar Daddy to see what this life CAN be like.",

As a woman, you can tell when a guy really cares for you and he shows it when he's willing to use his time and money to help you. Even in vanilla dating, I met a guy on match who had no problem picking up the bill whenever we went out, paid for my groceries/car repairs without being asked, gave gifts without being asked and actually went to the doctors with me. Men show when they want you and care about your well being. Doesnt sound like this guy did. Please dont cry over someone who threw you away.

If the shoe is on the other foot and a SD asks for extra sugar without giving any because of a personal hardship, the SBs here would cry foul, say he is a piece of shit for even asking, that he is a salt daddy, bait and switch, etc. and also say should break it off with him just for asking.  Sorry, if it is good for the goose, it is good for the gander, as they say.\n\nBut that said, I still think he was rather harsh and should have been nicer about ending it.  And yes, perhaps even it would have been good to show a little compassion and give her a parting gift.  But I don't know the full picture.  I know what it feels like as a SD to get asked for extras - even when it just happens once, it sometimes pierces deep depending on the context, because it can make one feel like an ATM, an object, not a person.  I am sure SBs can sympathize with that and having a very strong negative reaction to that.  \n\nAnd I am sorry what happened to the OP and that she didn't get help when she needed it, regardless of the context.  I just note that it wasn't his obligation to do it for her, though it certainly would have been a nice gesture.",

I do not know neither of you two, but there is two parts of this story, you and him. \n\nHe had his reasons to feel the way he did, maybe he has been scammed in the past, who knows? However, I really think you did not do anything wrong. My SD barely sees me, we had sex only twice in the last 2 months and he gave me10.5k, after that I asked for help, and he sent me another 3k. This is a person that I do not even know anything about. You guys were going out for almost a year, and he was paying the ppm, but you were servicing him too. Sincerely, what you had was not a SD it was just someone who found a way to have his needs met for less.\n\nNow, you worry me because regardless of what type of relationship you have, you should NEVER be dependent on a man to provide for you (husband, boyfriend, SD, whatever). You are an adult and should not count on people that much anymore, people are not reliable. It seems you have low self-esteem too, how can you say the guy was the best SD when he dumps you for something so unimportant, when you got sick? He could have given you the money and asked you to pay back if he did not think it was fair to him. What he did was just to replace you with a new SB, seriously? This guy is a jerk. Wipe up your tears and go find someone better.",

The lesson here is you as an SB are responsible for your own life which means to use the allowance wisely and build out a strong emergency fund that makes you depend on no one. \n\nThe way I see it is the SD always fulfilled his part of the financial obligation and is also a savvy guy who guards against sudden asks from SBs and risk being an ATM. We all know how prevalent those are in the bowl. He clearly had boundaries and respected those. \n\nWe really do not have the SDs side of the story but I wonder what he would have to say.\n\nThat\u2019s the HARSH reality of SRs. We all know that SBs are well advised not to indulge when the SD has financial problems and cannot pay regular ppm or allowance. Why should the standards be different for SDs? Imagine the SDs asking for free dates because they had a financial problem that month. Imagine the reaction from the SBs and in particular the commercial SBs.\n\nWe all know the long threads on SLF that happen when the SD missed a twenty on his allowance etc. How mercilessly the SD gets crucified for doing that. \n\nI personally respect the SD for standing hid ground",

If the shoe is on the other foot and a SD asks for extra sugar without giving any because of a personal hardship, the SBs here would cry foul, say he is a piece of shit for even asking, that he is a salt daddy, bait and switch, etc. and also say should break it off with him just for asking.  Sorry, if it is good for the goose, it is good for the gander, as they say.\n\nBut that said, I still think he was rather harsh and should have been nicer about ending it.  And yes, perhaps even it would have been good to show a little compassion and give her a parting gift.  But I don't know the full picture.  I know what it feels like as a SD to get asked for extras - even when it just happens once, it sometimes pierces deep depending on the context, because it can make one feel like an ATM, an object, not a person.  I am sure SBs can sympathize with that and having a very strong negative reaction to that.  \n\nAnd I am sorry what happened to the OP and that she didn't get help when she needed it, regardless of the context.  I just note that it wasn't his obligation to do it for her, though it certainly would have been a nice gesture.",

I felt like our personal connection became much stronger after I took care of her.  We were still PPM when she got hurt, that was the catalyst for me telling her I was putting her on an allowance.\n\nI think this guy was already planning to move on before you got COVID.

Any way I played football through college and went to medical school. I say that to say.  I never struggled getting women. Recently I people have been asking me for things.  One girl super beautiful asked me \u201cwhat I do for my girls?\u201d   I think she was talking about paying her rent or something. I told her I\u2019ll pay a 100% of the bills in the house.  She asked me about getting some vintage Nikes. I passed.  I have never been a buy a woman type person.  Never had to. \n\nYou said something about being perceived as a gold digger. There was something in the way she asked me for all that stuff. It changes it from someone I care about and help out to the girl I\u2019m renting.",
