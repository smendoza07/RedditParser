    "body": "Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/cn9d4l/blind_date/), I'm going to share a little story about why you should never do a \"blind date.\" \n\nSo, when I was in school, I was on SA, of course. I was new to the site but not the concept, but, I wasn't really aware of how things worked so I talked to a lot of guys with no photos, including Steve\\* (name changed), who seemed really cool, but absolutely refused to share any photos. I didn't see this as a red flag because I was stupid, and he insisted his work made him too well known and he was married and blah blah blah. So, we made a date.\n\nWe were set to meet at a pretty luxe hotel bar, where I actually knew the bartender, Tim\\*, so I knew he'd keep an eye out for me and, when I showed up, of course, he did. There were only three people in the bar when I got there. A couple, and an older man on his laptop, both back on little couches. The bar itself was empty. \n\nMy date was running late, insisting there was traffic. It wasn't a particularly heavy time for traffic, but, I figured he was further out. So, he keeps texting me telling me he's stuck, and I just believe him. We were set to meet at 7:30, and by this time it was probably like 7:35 or so so I wasn't too miffed. I just chatted with Tim, who got me a drink on him and kept me company. \n\nHalf an hour goes by, which I hardly even noticed, and I'm done with my drink. Steve has been texting me, for some reason I'm confident he's not standing me up, so, I decide to order myself a drink. What's $18, eh? \n\nNow it's past 8 and I'm fed up. The bar was still pretty empty so I start texting some friends to see what they're up to that night. I get a notification to my business email that I have a deposit. It was for some work I'd done, so I figured I'd splurge and I asked for a food menu. I gave up on Steve when I ordered a crab cake and another drink. \n\nMy friends get back to me about hanging out, so I finish up, and tell Tim to get me my check while I go to the bathroom. I come back, and it's paid. Tim tells me a guy who had been in the bar (the older man with the laptop) had paid it and left. I was confused, but, also not really a stranger to guys paying my tab, so I asked if he left a number or anything and Tim said nope, just paid in cash, and didn't even stay to get his tip. I decide not to look a gift horse in the mouth and head out, thankful I'd saved like $50. \n\nIt's cold out, so I'm not really focusing on my phone or anything as I make my way to the subway. I finally pull out my phone and it's a text from Steve: \"You looked lovely tonight. Hope you enjoyed your meal.\" \n\n*TL;DR: I met up with a guy with no photos, I thought he never arrived so I had dinner alone, he was actually there the whole time and paid my tab without saying a single word to me.*",

Yet felt bad  standing you up and stiffing you with the bill.\n\nThen at his computer/phone wishing he had had the nerve, thought he could maybe have a second chance by telling you he paid thinking it might come off as appreciated and he might get a second chance.\n\n... but I'm an eternal optimist.\n\nI just know first hand how good intentions + paralyzing fear can cascade into horribly embarrassing situations.",

I can't tell you how many SBs tell me that they need a photo to show that I'm not an ax murderer, as if somehow you can tell an ax murder by looking at their face. The real reason I don't provide photos is because I'm cautious and rational about protecting my privacy. If anything, reluctance to share a photo shows weakness and vulnerability, which actually gives you an advantage and leverage if you think about it. A person with malicious intentions will just send you a fake photo. \n\nI think SBs can get away with not showing their face if they show tasteful shots of body and/or face obscured by hair. I can get a general sense of a woman's attractiveness without seeing her face. At least, that's how I feel. I'm understanding and respect a woman who values her privacy. To me, it tells me she's real and feels vulnerable, just like I do. It's not a red flag.",

The real reason I don't provide photos is because I'm cautious and rational about protecting my privacy. If anything, reluctance to share a photo shows weakness and vulnerability, which actually gives you an advantage and leverage if you think about it. A person with malicious intentions will just send you a fake photo. \n\nI think SBs can get away with not showing their face if they show tasteful shots of body and/or face obscured by hair. I can get a general sense of a woman's attractiveness without seeing her face. At least, that's how I feel. I'm understanding and respect a woman who values her privacy.

I can't tell you how many SBs tell me that they need a photo to show that I'm not an ax murderer, as if somehow you can tell an ax murder by looking at their face. The real reason I don't provide photos is because I'm cautious and rational about protecting my privacy. If anything, reluctance to share a photo shows weakness and vulnerability, which actually gives you an advantage and leverage if you think about it. A person with malicious intentions will just send you a fake photo. \n\nI think SBs can get away with not showing their face if they show tasteful shots of body and/or face obscured by hair. I can get a general sense of a woman's attractiveness without seeing her face. At least, that's how I feel. I'm understanding and respect a woman who values her privacy. To me, it tells me she's real and feels vulnerable, just like I do. It's not a red flag.",
