Still get Hyuuga kids in Kumo with less of a hassle.\n\n>No, it's not give the same result. Even among Uchihas, sharigan was said to be rare.\n\nYeah so why not take a Hyuuga dude's nut where you get more chances to get children with a Byakugan.\n\nNot only that but while the Uchiha and Hyuuga clans are both inbred af the Byakugan seems to be more common in the Hyuuga clan than the Sharingan is in the Uchiha clan.\n\nThe only Hyuuga we see *without* a Byakugan is a half Hyuuga in Boruto.\n\nMaking the the chances for a half Hyuuga to have a Byakugan more than or equal to 50%.\n\nThis again makes stealing a male Hyuuga's nut the more sensible, easier and more efficient way rather than kidnapping a child heiress for breeding later on.\n\nThis plus their demands of Hiyashi's corpse means they didn't want her for breeding just her eyes.",

I mean who was Hinata going to marry within the clan to keep the bloodline going? (Assuming the hyuga ways stayed the same.)",

Danzo had Senju DNA thanks to which he could even turn the most common sharingan in bending reality bullshit jutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>vs a dude's nut that works alot faster.\n\nAnd which could be useless for all they know, and again how they will acquire it on the first place? Just ask? ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Because she was the youngest and most physically defenseless Hyuuga at that time.\n\nThere was Neij. They didn't consider him worthy enough apparently. (Edit: and he didn't had curse mark back then)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is literally no logical reason\n\nThere is. Main Hyuga branch is considered the strongest.
