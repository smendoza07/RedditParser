Dude's a legendary hero, you know those kids would claim their heritage at some point and the moms would have no reason hiding it from them.

The world would already know about them, by now. \n\nPlus, we mostly see Jiraiya hang in brothels, and prostitutes generally take precautions not to have kids. I think he did get around a lot, but it's unlikely that he left any offspring.",

And Amado would 100% pick some of them up to do experiments on.\n\nIt's filler but he told the woman from the star symbol village he couldn't give her a baby since his heart belonged to another. It shows what was in mind for Jiraiya. It's not as if Kishimoto didn't have editorial control over the anime.\n\nAnd all of you can stop it with the, he egged Naruto on to transform. Naruto did it first without him asking.\n\nDon't read into it, like at all. It's soley for comedic value like how Zenitsu said to Tanjiro and Inosuke, you two come with me very seriously. Only to berate them for acting like it was grueling when actually he was going to like it.\n\nKonohamaru used a reverse sexy jutsu on Sakura and she liked it as well, much to her chagrin.\n\nIf Jiraiya had done that, eventually Tsunade would hear about it in her travels and they would be trying to collect child support from since he was rich and famous.",

At 13, Japan's base age of consent is the lowest of any developed country. However, many prefectures also have local \"corruption of minors\" or \"obscenity statutes\" (\u6deb\u884c\u6761\u4f8b) which raise the de-facto age of consent to 16-18, unless they are in a \"sincere romantic relationship\", usually determined by parental consent. For example, the effective age of consent in Tokyo by local statute is 18. The age of marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys with parental permission, and 20 otherwise (as stated in \" \uff85\uff7d\u9083\uff62\u7ab6\u614a\uff76\u7ab6\uff62\uff85\uff78\uff85\uff7d\uff86\u505c?\u90b8\", the Child Welfare Act of Japan.\n\nStop promoting pedophiles.",

Dude's a legendary hero, you know those kids would claim their heritage at some point and the moms would have no reason hiding it from them. It's been over 15 years since he died, in the current timeline, meaning the youngest a kid of his could be is 15. The world would already know about them, by now. \n\nPlus, we mostly see Jiraiya hang in brothels, and prostitutes generally take precautions not to have kids. I think he did get around a lot, but it's unlikely that he left any offspring.",

It shows what was in mind for Jiraiya. It's not as if Kishimoto didn't have editorial control over the anime.\n\nAnd all of you can stop it with the, he egged Naruto on to transform. Naruto did it first without him asking.\n\nDon't read into it, like at all. It's soley for comedic value like how Zenitsu said to Tanjiro and Inosuke, you two come with me very seriously. Only to berate them for acting like it was grueling when actually he was going to like it.\n\nKonohamaru used a reverse sexy jutsu on Sakura and she liked it as well, much to her chagrin.\n\nIf Jiraiya had done that, eventually Tsunade would hear about it in her travels and they would be trying to collect child support from since he was rich and famous.",

At 13, Japan's base age of consent is the lowest of any developed country. However, many prefectures also have local \"corruption of minors\" or \"obscenity statutes\" (\u6deb\u884c\u6761\u4f8b) which raise the de-facto age of consent to 16-18, unless they are in a \"sincere romantic relationship\", usually determined by parental consent. For example, the effective age of consent in Tokyo by local statute is 18. The age of marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys with parental permission, and 20 otherwise (as stated in \" \uff85\uff7d\u9083\uff62\u7ab6\u614a\uff76\u7ab6\uff62\uff85\uff78\uff85\uff7d\uff86\u505c?\u90b8\", the Child Welfare Act of Japan.\n\nStop promoting pedophiles.",

Dude's a legendary hero, you know those kids would claim their heritage at some point and the moms would have no reason hiding it from them. It's been over 15 years since he died, in the current timeline, meaning the youngest a kid of his could be is 15. The world would already know about them, by now. \n\nPlus, we mostly see Jiraiya hang in brothels, and prostitutes generally take precautions not to have kids. I think he did get around a lot, but it's unlikely that he left any offspring.",

It's like an episode of Three's Company.\n\nIf pre-industrial contraceptives were highly effective there would be a lot less synthetic types today.\n\nEven IRL, several types of contraceptives have issues. If it contains estrogen, it can cause blood clotting. Taking it a few times will be most likely be fine but taking it regularly is where the issues really start.

And Amado would 100% pick some of them up to do experiments on.\n\nIt's filler but he told the woman from the star symbol village he couldn't give her a baby since his heart belonged to another. It shows what was in mind for Jiraiya. It's not as if Kishimoto didn't have editorial control over the anime.\n\nAnd all of you can stop it with the, he egged Naruto on to transform. Naruto did it first without him asking.\n\nDon't read into it, like at all. It's soley for comedic value like how Zenitsu said to Tanjiro and Inosuke, you two come with me very seriously. Only to berate them for acting like it was grueling when actually he was going to like it.\n\nKonohamaru used a reverse sexy jutsu on Sakura and she liked it as well, much to her chagrin.\n\nIf Jiraiya had done that, eventually Tsunade would hear about it in her travels and they would be trying to collect child support from since he was rich and famous.",

At 13, Japan's base age of consent is the lowest of any developed country. However, many prefectures also have local \"corruption of minors\" or \"obscenity statutes\" (\u6deb\u884c\u6761\u4f8b) which raise the de-facto age of consent to 16-18, unless they are in a \"sincere romantic relationship\", usually determined by parental consent. For example, the effective age of consent in Tokyo by local statute is 18. The age of marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys with parental permission, and 20 otherwise (as stated in \" \uff85\uff7d\u9083\uff62\u7ab6\u614a\uff76\u7ab6\uff62\uff85\uff78\uff85\uff7d\uff86\u505c?\u90b8\", the Child Welfare Act of Japan.\n\nStop promoting pedophiles.",

Dude's a legendary hero, you know those kids would claim their heritage at some point and the moms would have no reason hiding it from them. It's been over 15 years since he died, in the current timeline, meaning the youngest a kid of his could be is 15. The world would already know about them, by now. \n\nPlus, we mostly see Jiraiya hang in brothels, and prostitutes generally take precautions not to have kids.

If it contains estrogen, it can cause blood clotting. Taking it a few times will be most likely be fine but taking it regularly is where the issues really start.

If she did get pregnant in that time then she couldn't be a medic for a while and if she didn't take care of the kid then someone has to anyway.\n\nKakashi was depresses too after Rin's death, there was no one like Dan and Rin to them but I expect Kakashi is finally able to heal after the war. Every time they opened their heart up a little, it got stomped on.\n\nSo I expect Kakashi has now or is at least dating. I wish they showed him get married in a novel and show him with kids in Boruto.\n\nThey aren't the type of people to have casual sex, Jiraiya seems like his but when it comes down to it he's actually upstanding. Yall would call him a simp for Tsunade if he didn't hang out with the prostitutes. Impossible to win with you people.",

Only to berate them for acting like it was grueling when actually he was going to like it.\n\nKonohamaru used a reverse sexy jutsu on Sakura and she liked it as well, much to her chagrin.\n\nIf Jiraiya had done that, eventually Tsunade would hear about it in her travels and they would be trying to collect child support from since he was rich and famous.",

However, many prefectures also have local \"corruption of minors\" or \"obscenity statutes\" (\u6deb\u884c\u6761\u4f8b) which raise the de-facto age of consent to 16-18, unless they are in a \"sincere romantic relationship\", usually determined by parental consent. For example, the effective age of consent in Tokyo by local statute is 18. The age of marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys with parental permission, and 20 otherwise (as stated in \" \uff85\uff7d\u9083\uff62\u7ab6\u614a\uff76\u7ab6\uff62\uff85\uff78\uff85\uff7d\uff86\u505c?\u90b8\", the Child Welfare Act of Japan.\n\nStop promoting pedophiles.",

If she did get pregnant in that time then she couldn't be a medic for a while and if she didn't take care of the kid then someone has to anyway.\n\nKakashi was depresses too after Rin's death, there was no one like Dan and Rin to them but I expect Kakashi is finally able to heal after the war. Every time they opened their heart up a little, it got stomped on.\n\nSo I expect Kakashi has now or is at least dating. I wish they showed him get married in a novel and show him with kids in Boruto.\n\nThey aren't the type of people to have casual sex, Jiraiya seems like his but when it comes down to it he's actually upstanding. Yall would call him a simp for Tsunade if he didn't hang out with the prostitutes. Impossible to win with you people.",

It shows what was in mind for Jiraiya. It's not as if Kishimoto didn't have editorial control over the anime.\n\nAnd all of you can stop it with the, he egged Naruto on to transform. Naruto did it first without him asking.\n\nDon't read into it, like at all. It's soley for comedic value like how Zenitsu said to Tanjiro and Inosuke, you two come with me very seriously. Only to berate them for acting like it was grueling when actually he was going to like it.\n\nKonohamaru used a reverse sexy jutsu on Sakura and she liked it as well, much to her chagrin.\n\nIf Jiraiya had done that, eventually Tsunade would hear about it in her travels and they would be trying to collect child support from since he was rich and famous.",

Not all of them would become shinobi of course, but you think none of them would? \ud83e\udd21\n\nAnd not just shinobi, they could become outers, outlaws, or anyone else that fights.\n\nI don't know if she has had sex, but definitely not with anyone besides Dan because it took her like 20 or more years to heal from his death. If she did get pregnant in that time then she couldn't be a medic for a while and if she didn't take care of the kid then someone has to anyway.\n\nKakashi was depresses too after Rin's death, there was no one like Dan and Rin to them but I expect Kakashi is finally able to heal after the war. Every time they opened their heart up a little, it got stomped on.\n\nSo I expect Kakashi has now or is at least dating. I wish they showed him get married in a novel and show him with kids in Boruto.\n\nThey aren't the type of people to have casual sex, Jiraiya seems like his but when it comes down to it he's actually upstanding. Yall would call him a simp for Tsunade if he didn't hang out with the prostitutes. Impossible to win with you people.",

And Amado would 100% pick some of them up to do experiments on.\n\nIt's filler but he told the woman from the star symbol village he couldn't give her a baby since his heart belonged to another. It shows what was in mind for Jiraiya. It's not as if Kishimoto didn't have editorial control over the anime.\n\nAnd all of you can stop it with the, he egged Naruto on to transform. Naruto did it first without him asking.\n\nDon't read into it, like at all. It's soley for comedic value like how Zenitsu said to Tanjiro and Inosuke, you two come with me very seriously. Only to berate them for acting like it was grueling when actually he was going to like it.\n\nKonohamaru used a reverse sexy jutsu on Sakura and she liked it as well, much to her chagrin.\n\nIf Jiraiya had done that, eventually Tsunade would hear about it in her travels and they would be trying to collect child support from since he was rich and famous.",
