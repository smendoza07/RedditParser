    "body": "A shy friend of mine, who I recently introduced to bowl, just shared this with me but this happened last Friday. Took him this long to get over it. I tried to walk him through most aspects of the process and how not to get scammed. How to never pay someone till you meet in person yada yada.\n\nSo this girl he met on SA, who he says was super hot, went on his 1st M&G with her, tells me they didnt connect all that much. Not much came out of that meeting. But the girl called him few days later and suggests that she is open to an arrangement at $X/ppm. $X is about 2x the average in this area. Of course not thinking with the right head, he is all over that. So they meet up for dinner. He makes hotel reservations. After dinner, she asks him, she is not comfortable riding in his car. How about they drive in her car to the hotel. No harm no foul. Friend gets in her car and while they are pulling in to the hotel parking lot, she asks for her PPM, saying she would feel comfortable getting it now, and leaving it in the car as she has been scammed before. Friend hands over the cash. :).\n\nRight before turning into a parking spot, she tells him, the parking spot is tight, why dont you step out while I park. Need I finish?  I am dying laughing my ass off.",

When she agreed  and approached me, I figured, OK she's here for real,  so at my suggestion, we skipped it until later. That's when I gave her the sugar to have her feel at ease.  We also had tickets to a show  later, leaving little time for dinner, if we had too much  playtime first we'd be too hurried.  It was a \"high sugar\" overnight date. Not the way to start I guess. \n\nA few months later, I did sugar incrementally but made a hide and seek game of it. Arrival, at dinner, back in the room. that worked out much better. We had  discussed mutual protection against scams a head of time  and both had been victims. ",

We also had tickets to a show  later, leaving little time for dinner, if we had too much  playtime first we'd be too hurried.  It was a \"high sugar\" overnight date. Not the way to start I guess. \n\nA few months later, I did sugar incrementally but made a hide and seek game of it. Arrival, at dinner, back in the room. that worked out much better.

When she agreed  and approached me, I figured, OK she's here for real,  so at my suggestion, we skipped it until later. That's when I gave her the sugar to have her feel at ease.  We also had tickets to a show  later, leaving little time for dinner, if we had too much  playtime first we'd be too hurried.  It was a \"high sugar\" overnight date. Not the way to start I guess. \n\nA few months later, I did sugar incrementally but made a hide and seek game of it. Arrival, at dinner, back in the room. that worked out much better. We had  discussed mutual protection against scams a head of time  and both had been victims. ",
