Guys like to see that you are doing stuff . It gives them a fantasy fairy tale into your life which makes you look more inviting .You an always dm me personally if you have any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut remember you are gorgeous and there are enough sugar daddies to go around and trust if one guy doesn't follow through someone else will :)",

My \"type\" is a petite but busty woman, and for the life of me, I can't begin to take a guess as to your bustiness. Your profile thumbnail would make me think you were flat chested, so I would probably never open your profile unless I was weeks into my search and noticed that you marked yourself as \"curvy\". Even then, after looking at your pics, I wouldn't be able to tell. At that point, I'd probably just move on instead of trying to come up with a decent message.",
