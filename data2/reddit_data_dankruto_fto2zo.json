Writers often do this, they know where they want to go and instead of writing a road on how to get there they go backwards from where they wanted to end up.\n\nThe ending Kishimoto wanted was (Probably) Naruto Vs Sasuke, all else that happens in the series is just him creating the context for that ending to take place.",

Intentions were revealed and sometimes changed, but the series was always building up to the great ninja war. \n\nAnd the power escalation made perfect since given the context. Madara absorbed the power of nine beast with practically limitless destructive power. If the power scaling didn\u2019t go up than the Akatsuki\u2019s goal wouldn\u2019t have made sense. And all the characters got the conclusion they deserved, it\u2019s not like every single side character needs an arc.\n\nThe series only gets bad at the kaguya revival part. Some side characters were pretty dull but it\u2019s bit dramatic to call them poorly written. And you can skip filler, the anime ended 3 years ago there\u2019s even a Naruto Kai now.",

Kaguya and Zetsu were probably the worst thing to ever come out of Naruto.\nMadara was defeated in a stupid way, they went on and on about the power of Friendship and Cooperation and then Naruto and Sasuke were the only one who's actions mattered. Both shows have their strength but Shippuden has none of the technical aspects of Ninja combats that the first serie had, Shippuden is just people throwing energy stuff at each others and seeing who can withstand it better. There were some great moments, good moments, bad moments and mostly fillers to tie it all together.\n\nEven ignoring the fillers the show, both of them (and the manga it's based upon) have many problems, Kishimoto isn't good at world building, he's good at Character writing and in Shippuden he shifted into world building, which he isn't capable of doing.\n\nIt was such a missed opportunity to make something great, if only he was a better writer.\n\nHonestly who could tell me that Naruto has some good lore and worldbuilding, compared to the character focused moments.\n\nLike all of the scene with Shikamaru after >!Asuma death's;< or Naruto and >!Jiraya's!<. The show is at its best there and not showing you this pointless world of Space Chakra and dimension bullshit.\n\nThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell. \n\nThey have some characters who really have nothing to do, like Sakura, Ino, Tenten and Hinata, until the end they have nothing to do. (I'm sure people will want to defend their Waifus).\n\nCharacters like Neji, Lee, Shino and Kiba are abandoned, Shikamaru and Choji's development gets changed whenever they feel like it.\n\nThe Akatsuki get some development but they're also retconned every once in a while, not always good or bad.\n\nSome characters are better in Shippuden, like Itachi, he did get a lot of development in the second serie.\n\nSome Characters are completely abandoned like Orochimaru and Kabuto. They're shadows of their former selves and it's a shame because Orochimaru was one of my favs in Naruto.\n\nI could go on but I don't want to rant for too long.\n\nPeace out and bye.",

The series is literally called naruto of course everything will revolve around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that every side character is going to have some big shining moment when new side characters are introduced every arc. The purpose of a side character is to work for the plot not for the plot to work for them. And many side characters have presence throughout the whole series like Kabuto and Orochimaru, how were they abandoned? What more did you want from them? Shikamaru has MVP moments in 4 different arcs and has an entire arc to himself. \n\nThe Kaguya plot twist was properly foreshadowed before the war arc and  well explained within the series even if Madara was the better villain it doesn\u2019t mean the plot twist made no sense. And everyone\u2019s actions mattered, Naruto wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as he did without the people around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to try to downplay everyone\u2019s role in the series because things would\u2019ve played out differently if it weren\u2019t for characters like itachi and Jiraiya etc.\n\nAnd you need to provide evidence before you say stuff like \u201cThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell.\u201d You keep saying characters development were retconned but you provide no proof.\n\nAll the side characters concluded what ever internal struggle they had going on (example: Neji and Rock lee). It just seems like you expected them to get as much screen time as main characters which doesn\u2019t happen in any series unless it\u2019s slice of life.\n\nThe fights still had strategy even up to the war arc. Example: Sasuke v Deidara, Obito v Kakashi, itachi v Sasuke and Hidan v Shikamaru.\n\nAnd pretty much everything else in that rant is just a bunch of complaints with no reason or evidence attached to it. Like at least explain how Choji\u2019s development is changed.",

And in Boruto he's far and thin whenever he wants, like, again, WTF?\n\nNeji was right in the end, during the chunin exams he said it.\n\nNaruto has declined in quality over the years, it's by far not a bad serie, it's just average.\n\nA lot of anime fall into that bad writing, they start out great and then drop like shit.\n\nI'm talking as a fan, if you can't admit that the serie has its problems then you must be blind. It's better to be out of the circlejerk and admit it, the serie has really gone downhill.",

His point was that people can\u2019t change their position in hierarchy/society no matter how fit or unfit they are for that position. Like Hinata was was technically destined to become the leader for the hyuga even though she was clearly unfit for it and she never did become fit for it even though it was her destiny. He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

That\u2019s how you get ridiculous arguments like \u201cNeji is right about destiny\u201d , \u201cObito started a war because his crush died\u201d or my personal favorite \u201cNaruto\u2019s underdog story got ruined\u201d. \n\nKaguya\u2019s revival itself wasn\u2019t bad but pretty much everything that involved her made the series less enjoyable and made the series make less sense. This part took up about less than a third of the war arc and it was terrible but it didn\u2019t ruin the war arc for me and saying that it ruined the whole series is just overdramatic.\n\nHagoromo served his purpose he was a mediocre character but that\u2019s fine considering he had probably 8-15 minutes of screen time. And after the pain arc there were so many good moments like the waterfall of truth and the reunion of Sasuke and itachi.",

Naruto is one of my favorites series, but just because it is doesnt make it immune to my criticism, it would be dishonest from me to just ignore all the bad writing, just as it would for you. the story was changed constantly from one thing to another, Kishimoto had no actual direction, he only had plot-points he wanted to reach, its pretty clear hes not the great writer you seem to think he is, even his new serie is being canceled after only a few months of coming out. hes not capable of writing stories, his strength is in the character writing, which he abandoned around the war arc, some characters did get a good treatment, like Itachi (as ive said 4 times already, not only him but also a few others).",

My point is that Naruto\u2019s overall quality was consistent from land of waves up to the beginning of the ninja war. I understand why that arc is controversial. If you hate that arc I would understand. I was lucky enough to experience the war arc through the video game adaptation so I enjoyed it for the most part. \n\nEver since the beginning of part 2 the plot was clearly headed to some type of massive war because the Akatsuki were collecting 9 beast with practically limitless destructive power. And lack of screen time does not mean abandoned. Side characters are meant to serve the plot not the other way around. Side characters were used whenever they were necessary. People had extremely high hopes for Naruto side characters in particular which I don\u2019t understand.",

If you skip all of the filler and only watch the canon episodes everything makes much more sense. Not only that, Kishimoto had a clear path the entire series. Just because it wasn't clear to you, doesn't mean it isn't there. You say Boruto is trash, but that only because 90% of the anime so far is filler, in which the filler is horrendous at best. If you take out the filler Boruto is a quality anime. It's not great, but it is still exceptional. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are on equal terms from my somewhat unbiased opinion. The main difference is you own personal preference and opinion. In fact, if it weren't for the constant nostalgic feeling I get from Naruto, then I'd likely say that Naruto Shippuden is far better than Naruto. Realistically, Shippuden has everything Naruto has, but more. More action, more characters, same/more emotion, more power, more plot twists, just more. In the end you have your opinion and everyone else has their own. So maybe try not to call someone else delusional while putting your own OPINION above theirs. Delusional and ignorant, that isnt a good combination my friend.",

Writers often do this, they know where they want to go and instead of writing a road on how to get there they go backwards from where they wanted to end up.\n\nThe ending Kishimoto wanted was (Probably) Naruto Vs Sasuke, all else that happens in the series is just him creating the context for that ending to take place.",

In a world where Naruto and Sasuke were fated to fight on another their actions had no weight. Ninja Jesus and His children were horrible characters. Kaguya and Zetsu were probably the worst thing to ever come out of Naruto.\nMadara was defeated in a stupid way, they went on and on about the power of Friendship and Cooperation and then Naruto and Sasuke were the only one who's actions mattered. Both shows have their strength but Shippuden has none of the technical aspects of Ninja combats that the first serie had, Shippuden is just people throwing energy stuff at each others and seeing who can withstand it better. There were some great moments, good moments, bad moments and mostly fillers to tie it all together.\n\nEven ignoring the fillers the show, both of them (and the manga it's based upon) have many problems, Kishimoto isn't good at world building, he's good at Character writing and in Shippuden he shifted into world building, which he isn't capable of doing.\n\nIt was such a missed opportunity to make something great, if only he was a better writer.\n\nHonestly who could tell me that Naruto has some good lore and worldbuilding, compared to the character focused moments.\n\nLike all of the scene with Shikamaru after >!Asuma death's;< or Naruto and >!Jiraya's!<. The show is at its best there and not showing you this pointless world of Space Chakra and dimension bullshit.\n\nThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell. \n\nThey have some characters who really have nothing to do, like Sakura, Ino, Tenten and Hinata, until the end they have nothing to do. (I'm sure people will want to defend their Waifus).\n\nCharacters like Neji, Lee, Shino and Kiba are abandoned, Shikamaru and Choji's development gets changed whenever they feel like it.\n\nThe Akatsuki get some development but they're also retconned every once in a while, not always good or bad.\n\nSome characters are better in Shippuden, like Itachi, he did get a lot of development in the second serie.\n\nSome Characters are completely abandoned like Orochimaru and Kabuto. They're shadows of their former selves and it's a shame because Orochimaru was one of my favs in Naruto.\n\nI could go on but I don't want to rant for too long.\n\nPeace out and bye.",

The series is literally called naruto of course everything will revolve around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that every side character is going to have some big shining moment when new side characters are introduced every arc. The purpose of a side character is to work for the plot not for the plot to work for them. And many side characters have presence throughout the whole series like Kabuto and Orochimaru, how were they abandoned? What more did you want from them? Shikamaru has MVP moments in 4 different arcs and has an entire arc to himself. \n\nThe Kaguya plot twist was properly foreshadowed before the war arc and  well explained within the series even if Madara was the better villain it doesn\u2019t mean the plot twist made no sense. And everyone\u2019s actions mattered, Naruto wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as he did without the people around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to try to downplay everyone\u2019s role in the series because things would\u2019ve played out differently if it weren\u2019t for characters like itachi and Jiraiya etc.\n\nAnd you need to provide evidence before you say stuff like \u201cThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell.\u201d You keep saying characters development were retconned but you provide no proof.\n\nAll the side characters concluded what ever internal struggle they had going on (example: Neji and Rock lee). It just seems like you expected them to get as much screen time as main characters which doesn\u2019t happen in any series unless it\u2019s slice of life.\n\nThe fights still had strategy even up to the war arc. Example: Sasuke v Deidara, Obito v Kakashi, itachi v Sasuke and Hidan v Shikamaru.\n\nAnd pretty much everything else in that rant is just a bunch of complaints with no reason or evidence attached to it.

And in Boruto he's far and thin whenever he wants, like, again, WTF?\n\nNeji was right in the end, during the chunin exams he said it.\n\nNaruto has declined in quality over the years, it's by far not a bad serie, it's just average.\n\nA lot of anime fall into that bad writing, they start out great and then drop like shit.\n\nI'm talking as a fan, if you can't admit that the serie has its problems then you must be blind.

He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

This part took up about less than a third of the war arc and it was terrible but it didn\u2019t ruin the war arc for me and saying that it ruined the whole series is just overdramatic.\n\nHagoromo served his purpose he was a mediocre character but that\u2019s fine considering he had probably 8-15 minutes of screen time.

If you skip all of the filler and only watch the canon episodes everything makes much more sense. Not only that, Kishimoto had a clear path the entire series. Just because it wasn't clear to you, doesn't mean it isn't there. You say Boruto is trash, but that only because 90% of the anime so far is filler, in which the filler is horrendous at best. If you take out the filler Boruto is a quality anime. It's not great, but it is still exceptional. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are on equal terms from my somewhat unbiased opinion. The main difference is you own personal preference and opinion. In fact, if it weren't for the constant nostalgic feeling I get from Naruto, then I'd likely say that Naruto Shippuden is far better than Naruto. Realistically, Shippuden has everything Naruto has, but more. More action, more characters, same/more emotion, more power, more plot twists, just more. In the end you have your opinion and everyone else has their own. So maybe try not to call someone else delusional while putting your own OPINION above theirs. Delusional and ignorant, that isnt a good combination my friend.",

In a world where Naruto and Sasuke were fated to fight on another their actions had no weight. Ninja Jesus and His children were horrible characters. Kaguya and Zetsu were probably the worst thing to ever come out of Naruto.\nMadara was defeated in a stupid way, they went on and on about the power of Friendship and Cooperation and then Naruto and Sasuke were the only one who's actions mattered. Both shows have their strength but Shippuden has none of the technical aspects of Ninja combats that the first serie had, Shippuden is just people throwing energy stuff at each others and seeing who can withstand it better. There were some great moments, good moments, bad moments and mostly fillers to tie it all together.\n\nEven ignoring the fillers the show, both of them (and the manga it's based upon) have many problems, Kishimoto isn't good at world building, he's good at Character writing and in Shippuden he shifted into world building, which he isn't capable of doing.\n\nIt was such a missed opportunity to make something great, if only he was a better writer.\n\nHonestly who could tell me that Naruto has some good lore and worldbuilding, compared to the character focused moments.\n\nLike all of the scene with Shikamaru after >!Asuma death's;< or Naruto and >!Jiraya's!<. The show is at its best there and not showing you this pointless world of Space Chakra and dimension bullshit.\n\nThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell. \n\nThey have some characters who really have nothing to do, like Sakura, Ino, Tenten and Hinata, until the end they have nothing to do. (I'm sure people will want to defend their Waifus).\n\nCharacters like Neji, Lee, Shino and Kiba are abandoned, Shikamaru and Choji's development gets changed whenever they feel like it.\n\nThe Akatsuki get some development but they're also retconned every once in a while, not always good or bad.\n\nSome characters are better in Shippuden, like Itachi, he did get a lot of development in the second serie.\n\nSome Characters are completely abandoned like Orochimaru and Kabuto. They're shadows of their former selves and it's a shame because Orochimaru was one of my favs in Naruto.\n\nI could go on but I don't want to rant for too long.\n\nPeace out and bye.",

The series is literally called naruto of course everything will revolve around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that every side character is going to have some big shining moment when new side characters are introduced every arc. The purpose of a side character is to work for the plot not for the plot to work for them. And many side characters have presence throughout the whole series like Kabuto and Orochimaru, how were they abandoned? What more did you want from them? Shikamaru has MVP moments in 4 different arcs and has an entire arc to himself. \n\nThe Kaguya plot twist was properly foreshadowed before the war arc and  well explained within the series even if Madara was the better villain it doesn\u2019t mean the plot twist made no sense. And everyone\u2019s actions mattered, Naruto wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as he did without the people around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to try to downplay everyone\u2019s role in the series because things would\u2019ve played out differently if it weren\u2019t for characters like itachi and Jiraiya etc.\n\nAnd you need to provide evidence before you say stuff like \u201cThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell.\u201d You keep saying characters development were retconned but you provide no proof.\n\nAll the side characters concluded what ever internal struggle they had going on (example: Neji and Rock lee). It just seems like you expected them to get as much screen time as main characters which doesn\u2019t happen in any series unless it\u2019s slice of life.\n\nThe fights still had strategy even up to the war arc. Example: Sasuke v Deidara, Obito v Kakashi, itachi v Sasuke and Hidan v Shikamaru.\n\nAnd pretty much everything else in that rant is just a bunch of complaints with no reason or evidence attached to it.

And in Boruto he's far and thin whenever he wants, like, again, WTF?\n\nNeji was right in the end, during the chunin exams he said it.\n\nNaruto has declined in quality over the years, it's by far not a bad serie, it's just average.\n\nA lot of anime fall into that bad writing, they start out great and then drop like shit.\n\nI'm talking as a fan, if you can't admit that the serie has its problems then you must be blind.

His point was that people can\u2019t change their position in hierarchy/society no matter how fit or unfit they are for that position. Like Hinata was was technically destined to become the leader for the hyuga even though she was clearly unfit for it and she never did become fit for it even though it was her destiny. He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

This part took up about less than a third of the war arc and it was terrible but it didn\u2019t ruin the war arc for me and saying that it ruined the whole series is just overdramatic.\n\nHagoromo served his purpose he was a mediocre character but that\u2019s fine considering he had probably 8-15 minutes of screen time. And after the pain arc there were so many good moments like the waterfall of truth and the reunion of Sasuke and itachi.",

I was lucky enough to experience the war arc through the video game adaptation so I enjoyed it for the most part. \n\nEver since the beginning of part 2 the plot was clearly headed to some type of massive war because the Akatsuki were collecting 9 beast with practically limitless destructive power. And lack of screen time does not mean abandoned. Side characters are meant to serve the plot not the other way around. Side characters were used whenever they were necessary.

If you skip all of the filler and only watch the canon episodes everything makes much more sense. Not only that, Kishimoto had a clear path the entire series. Just because it wasn't clear to you, doesn't mean it isn't there. You say Boruto is trash, but that only because 90% of the anime so far is filler, in which the filler is horrendous at best. If you take out the filler Boruto is a quality anime. It's not great, but it is still exceptional. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are on equal terms from my somewhat unbiased opinion. The main difference is you own personal preference and opinion. In fact, if it weren't for the constant nostalgic feeling I get from Naruto, then I'd likely say that Naruto Shippuden is far better than Naruto. Realistically, Shippuden has everything Naruto has, but more. More action, more characters, same/more emotion, more power, more plot twists, just more. In the end you have your opinion and everyone else has their own. So maybe try not to call someone else delusional while putting your own OPINION above theirs. Delusional and ignorant, that isnt a good combination my friend.",

In a world where Naruto and Sasuke were fated to fight on another their actions had no weight. Ninja Jesus and His children were horrible characters. Kaguya and Zetsu were probably the worst thing to ever come out of Naruto.\nMadara was defeated in a stupid way, they went on and on about the power of Friendship and Cooperation and then Naruto and Sasuke were the only one who's actions mattered. Both shows have their strength but Shippuden has none of the technical aspects of Ninja combats that the first serie had, Shippuden is just people throwing energy stuff at each others and seeing who can withstand it better. There were some great moments, good moments, bad moments and mostly fillers to tie it all together.\n\nEven ignoring the fillers the show, both of them (and the manga it's based upon) have many problems, Kishimoto isn't good at world building, he's good at Character writing and in Shippuden he shifted into world building, which he isn't capable of doing.\n\nIt was such a missed opportunity to make something great, if only he was a better writer.\n\nHonestly who could tell me that Naruto has some good lore and worldbuilding, compared to the character focused moments.\n\nLike all of the scene with Shikamaru after >!Asuma death's;< or Naruto and >!Jiraya's!<. The show is at its best there and not showing you this pointless world of Space Chakra and dimension bullshit.\n\nThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell. \n\nThey have some characters who really have nothing to do, like Sakura, Ino, Tenten and Hinata, until the end they have nothing to do. (I'm sure people will want to defend their Waifus).\n\nCharacters like Neji, Lee, Shino and Kiba are abandoned, Shikamaru and Choji's development gets changed whenever they feel like it.\n\nThe Akatsuki get some development but they're also retconned every once in a while, not always good or bad.\n\nSome characters are better in Shippuden, like Itachi, he did get a lot of development in the second serie.\n\nSome Characters are completely abandoned like Orochimaru and Kabuto. They're shadows of their former selves and it's a shame because Orochimaru was one of my favs in Naruto.\n\nI could go on but I don't want to rant for too long.\n\nPeace out and bye.",

                    "body": "You use the word \u201cabandon\u201d really excessively. Like we\u2019re you expecting each and every side character to have an arc to themselves? The series is literally called naruto of course everything will revolve around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that every side character is going to have some big shining moment when new side characters are introduced every arc. The purpose of a side character is to work for the plot not for the plot to work for them. And many side characters have presence throughout the whole series like Kabuto and Orochimaru, how were they abandoned? What more did you want from them? Shikamaru has MVP moments in 4 different arcs and has an entire arc to himself. \n\nThe Kaguya plot twist was properly foreshadowed before the war arc and  well explained within the series even if Madara was the better villain it doesn\u2019t mean the plot twist made no sense. And everyone\u2019s actions mattered, Naruto wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as he did without the people around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to try to downplay everyone\u2019s role in the series because things would\u2019ve played out differently if it weren\u2019t for characters like itachi and Jiraiya etc.\n\nAnd you need to provide evidence before you say stuff like \u201cThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell.\u201d You keep saying characters development were retconned but you provide no proof.\n\nAll the side characters concluded what ever internal struggle they had going on (example: Neji and Rock lee). It just seems like you expected them to get as much screen time as main characters which doesn\u2019t happen in any series unless it\u2019s slice of life.\n\nThe fights still had strategy even up to the war arc. Example: Sasuke v Deidara, Obito v Kakashi, itachi v Sasuke and Hidan v Shikamaru.\n\nAnd pretty much everything else in that rant is just a bunch of complaints with no reason or evidence attached to it. Like at least explain how Choji\u2019s development is changed.",

And in Boruto he's far and thin whenever he wants, like, again, WTF?\n\nNeji was right in the end, during the chunin exams he said it.\n\nNaruto has declined in quality over the years, it's by far not a bad serie, it's just average.\n\nA lot of anime fall into that bad writing, they start out great and then drop like shit.\n\nI'm talking as a fan, if you can't admit that the serie has its problems then you must be blind. It's better to be out of the circlejerk and admit it, the serie has really gone downhill.",

His point was that people can\u2019t change their position in hierarchy/society no matter how fit or unfit they are for that position. Like Hinata was was technically destined to become the leader for the hyuga even though she was clearly unfit for it and she never did become fit for it even though it was her destiny. He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

If you skip all of the filler and only watch the canon episodes everything makes much more sense. Not only that, Kishimoto had a clear path the entire series. Just because it wasn't clear to you, doesn't mean it isn't there. You say Boruto is trash, but that only because 90% of the anime so far is filler, in which the filler is horrendous at best. If you take out the filler Boruto is a quality anime. It's not great, but it is still exceptional. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are on equal terms from my somewhat unbiased opinion. The main difference is you own personal preference and opinion. In fact, if it weren't for the constant nostalgic feeling I get from Naruto, then I'd likely say that Naruto Shippuden is far better than Naruto. Realistically, Shippuden has everything Naruto has, but more. More action, more characters, same/more emotion, more power, more plot twists, just more. In the end you have your opinion and everyone else has their own. So maybe try not to call someone else delusional while putting your own OPINION above theirs. Delusional and ignorant, that isnt a good combination my friend.",

The series is literally called naruto of course everything will revolve around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that every side character is going to have some big shining moment when new side characters are introduced every arc. The purpose of a side character is to work for the plot not for the plot to work for them. And many side characters have presence throughout the whole series like Kabuto and Orochimaru, how were they abandoned? What more did you want from them? Shikamaru has MVP moments in 4 different arcs and has an entire arc to himself. \n\nThe Kaguya plot twist was properly foreshadowed before the war arc and  well explained within the series even if Madara was the better villain it doesn\u2019t mean the plot twist made no sense. And everyone\u2019s actions mattered, Naruto wouldn\u2019t have gotten as far as he did without the people around him. It\u2019s ridiculous to try to downplay everyone\u2019s role in the series because things would\u2019ve played out differently if it weren\u2019t for characters like itachi and Jiraiya etc.\n\nAnd you need to provide evidence before you say stuff like \u201cThe Kyuubi and the other tailed beasts were being changed and they did whatever the fuck they wanted with them, like they did all Characters, they have a Character with an established personality and they change it to fit whatever story they want to tell.\u201d You keep saying characters development were retconned but you provide no proof.\n\nAll the side characters concluded what ever internal struggle they had going on (example: Neji and Rock lee). It just seems like you expected them to get as much screen time as main characters which doesn\u2019t happen in any series unless it\u2019s slice of life.\n\nThe fights still had strategy even up to the war arc. Example: Sasuke v Deidara, Obito v Kakashi, itachi v Sasuke and Hidan v Shikamaru.\n\nAnd pretty much everything else in that rant is just a bunch of complaints with no reason or evidence attached to it. Like at least explain how Choji\u2019s development is changed.",

And in Boruto he's far and thin whenever he wants, like, again, WTF?\n\nNeji was right in the end, during the chunin exams he said it.\n\nNaruto has declined in quality over the years, it's by far not a bad serie, it's just average.\n\nA lot of anime fall into that bad writing, they start out great and then drop like shit.\n\nI'm talking as a fan, if you can't admit that the serie has its problems then you must be blind.

                            "body": "Neji didn\u2019t talk about destiny in the literal sense. His point was that people can\u2019t change their position in hierarchy/society no matter how fit or unfit they are for that position. Like Hinata was was technically destined to become the leader for the hyuga even though she was clearly unfit for it and she never did become fit for it even though it was her destiny. He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

That\u2019s how you get ridiculous arguments like \u201cNeji is right about destiny\u201d , \u201cObito started a war because his crush died\u201d or my personal favorite \u201cNaruto\u2019s underdog story got ruined\u201d. \n\nKaguya\u2019s revival itself wasn\u2019t bad but pretty much everything that involved her made the series less enjoyable and made the series make less sense. This part took up about less than a third of the war arc and it was terrible but it didn\u2019t ruin the war arc for me and saying that it ruined the whole series is just overdramatic.\n\nHagoromo served his purpose he was a mediocre character but that\u2019s fine considering he had probably 8-15 minutes of screen time. And after the pain arc there were so many good moments like the waterfall of truth and the reunion of Sasuke and itachi.",

My point is that Naruto\u2019s overall quality was consistent from land of waves up to the beginning of the ninja war. I understand why that arc is controversial. If you hate that arc I would understand. I was lucky enough to experience the war arc through the video game adaptation so I enjoyed it for the most part. \n\nEver since the beginning of part 2 the plot was clearly headed to some type of massive war because the Akatsuki were collecting 9 beast with practically limitless destructive power. And lack of screen time does not mean abandoned. Side characters are meant to serve the plot not the other way around. Side characters were used whenever they were necessary. People had extremely high hopes for Naruto side characters in particular which I don\u2019t understand.",

If you skip all of the filler and only watch the canon episodes everything makes much more sense. Not only that, Kishimoto had a clear path the entire series. Just because it wasn't clear to you, doesn't mean it isn't there. You say Boruto is trash, but that only because 90% of the anime so far is filler, in which the filler is horrendous at best. If you take out the filler Boruto is a quality anime. It's not great, but it is still exceptional. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are on equal terms from my somewhat unbiased opinion. The main difference is you own personal preference and opinion. In fact, if it weren't for the constant nostalgic feeling I get from Naruto, then I'd likely say that Naruto Shippuden is far better than Naruto. Realistically, Shippuden has everything Naruto has, but more. More action, more characters, same/more emotion, more power, more plot twists, just more. In the end you have your opinion and everyone else has their own. So maybe try not to call someone else delusional while putting your own OPINION above theirs. Delusional and ignorant, that isnt a good combination my friend.",

His point was that people can\u2019t change their position in hierarchy/society no matter how fit or unfit they are for that position. Like Hinata was was technically destined to become the leader for the hyuga even though she was clearly unfit for it and she never did become fit for it even though it was her destiny. He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

This part took up about less than a third of the war arc and it was terrible but it didn\u2019t ruin the war arc for me and saying that it ruined the whole series is just overdramatic.\n\nHagoromo served his purpose he was a mediocre character but that\u2019s fine considering he had probably 8-15 minutes of screen time.

My point is that Naruto\u2019s overall quality was consistent from land of waves up to the beginning of the ninja war. I understand why that arc is controversial. If you hate that arc I would understand. I was lucky enough to experience the war arc through the video game adaptation so I enjoyed it for the most part. \n\nEver since the beginning of part 2 the plot was clearly headed to some type of massive war because the Akatsuki were collecting 9 beast with practically limitless destructive power. And lack of screen time does not mean abandoned. Side characters are meant to serve the plot not the other way around. Side characters were used whenever they were necessary. People had extremely high hopes for Naruto side characters in particular which I don\u2019t understand.",

His point was that people can\u2019t change their position in hierarchy/society no matter how fit or unfit they are for that position. Like Hinata was was technically destined to become the leader for the hyuga even though she was clearly unfit for it and she never did become fit for it even though it was her destiny. He believed naruto would stay a hated outcast because that\u2019s how he was born. \n\n  Naruto was not an underdog story. By mid way of the land if waves arc it should\u2019ve been obvious that Naruto was not an underdog because by this point it was stated that his only disadvantage to his peers was his poor chakra control and this was because he had practically infinite chakra and also he was shown to be able to tap into the chakra of the nine tailed beast that almost destroyed a village full of Shinobi, so did he really have it that bad? And throughout part 1 he was shown to be clever enough to find ways around his handicap so it\u2019s not even like he was stupid either. In the final valley fight Sasuke literally acknowledges that Naruto is \u201cspecial\u201d so definitely by this point it\u2019s clear that this was not meant to be an underdog story. This is the worst misconception for the series I\u2019ve heard and it shows that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\n\nHundreds of fights?? Really!?\n\nKaguya AKA \u201cthe rabbit goddess\u201d was name dropped a couple times throughout the series not just in the war arc. Black zestu was a mystery all throughout the series because is objectives were never stated until the plot twist and he had presence even during part 1 so he didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But you would only know this if you\u2019d pay attention.\n\nAnd choji\u2019s transformation being inconsistent is as petty as complaining about goku\u2019s hair turning to normal after ss3. It makes no difference either way, why be mad over something so trivial?\n\nEdit: and no one ever tried to understand the tailed beast except Naruto so of course people just thought they were mindless.",

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

This part took up about less than a third of the war arc and it was terrible but it didn\u2019t ruin the war arc for me and saying that it ruined the whole series is just overdramatic.\n\nHagoromo served his purpose he was a mediocre character but that\u2019s fine considering he had probably 8-15 minutes of screen time.

You have to understand that in the process of writing a serie people change things, especially in an on-going serie like the ShonenJump series. You're trying to give this things too much sense, the story was not ready from the beginning, someone above me confirmed this as well, with no sources, that Kishimoto wanted to end the serie with Naruto Vs Sasuke, it was obvious that he had a goal in mind and just went backwards from that plot point, but going this way ruins everything else, the characters are supposed to have a natural development and in Naruto they don't really have that, some of them do, but the characters change to serve the plot and the writers, it's the lazy writer technique. I like Naruto, wether you believe this or not, but the story isn't as good, the characters were the best part of it and by the end Kishimoto and his assistants cast them aside to focus on the plot which they were incapable of writing. You can't seriously tell me it's good or they had thought about it from the beginning, Kaguya came out of nowhere to save Kishimoto after he wrote himself into a corner. Ninja Jesus was so dumb, he could've been a great character but he was just literally was a 2Dimensional boring character. The resurrection parts were so dumb, the only thing that was salvageable were the characters and Kishimoto failed at it, the last good episode was the Naruto Vs Sasuke fight, after that it was fillers all over again and a couple of movies. They milked the franchise dry, both ShonenJump and The Studio Pierrot, like they're doing with Boruto now. It's such a wasted opportunity and time. I loved this serie as a kid, I grew up with it, but it's really not as great as everyone says it is, especially Shippuden. The second part of the serie was particularly bad, especially after the Pain Arc, after that the good moments were few, Itachi had some of the best development in Shippuden (as I've said already) even other characters had, but by the war arc everything was forgotten, one of the worst arcs I've seen, ever.",

Naruto is one of my favorites series, but just because it is doesnt make it immune to my criticism, it would be dishonest from me to just ignore all the bad writing, just as it would for you. the story was changed constantly from one thing to another, Kishimoto had no actual direction, he only had plot-points he wanted to reach, its pretty clear hes not the great writer you seem to think he is, even his new serie is being canceled after only a few months of coming out. hes not capable of writing stories, his strength is in the character writing, which he abandoned around the war arc, some characters did get a good treatment, like Itachi (as ive said 4 times already, not only him but also a few others).",
