Just saying \"Sam from Supernatural\" usually makes people understand the gist at least. \n\nAny suggestions?

I've seen some pretty long combed over slept back kind of styles with longer hair. \n\nI just don't like when there is too much weight and you part it to the right and left and it just looks droopy and weighed down. Or how women typically have longer hair, looks great on you all....not for me. Lol I like it slicked back to some degree. Which seems like it will happen overall with longer hair, so that so why the Sam look is goalpost. It could definitely move over time!",

Good call on flipping your part, once hair settles on the follicle, gravity takes over and it starts to lay flat so switching up the part helps give it a nice boost of volume. \n\nYoure definitely going to run into it being too heavy and flopping over. So you have two choices. 1- just let it keep growing and love through some awkward stages. I\u2019d use this time to play around with product and styling techniques. I told my cousin every time he washes his hands, take his wet hands and comb back his hair with them. This will help train it back. 2- get it thinned out so you keep volume and it\u2019s easier to style but this will likely prolong your grow out. \n\nYou\u2019ll likely need something heavier than pomade soon for hold while  pomade gives a nice moldable hold it won\u2019t keep your hair from flopping down when it gets too long. I\u2019d mix in some high hold gel with your pomade once it gets to that point \n\nI\u2019m invested in your hair journey now! Haha best of luck and dm me if you ever run into dilemmas or have any questions. I love this stuff!!",

I've seen some pretty long combed over slept back kind of styles with longer hair. \n\nI just don't like when there is too much weight and you part it to the right and left and it just looks droopy and weighed down. Or how women typically have longer hair, looks great on you all....not for me. Lol I like it slicked back to some degree. Which seems like it will happen overall with longer hair, so that so why the Sam look is goalpost. It could definitely move over time!",

Good call on flipping your part, once hair settles on the follicle, gravity takes over and it starts to lay flat so switching up the part helps give it a nice boost of volume. \n\nYoure definitely going to run into it being too heavy and flopping over. So you have two choices. 1- just let it keep growing and love through some awkward stages. I\u2019d use this time to play around with product and styling techniques. I told my cousin every time he washes his hands, take his wet hands and comb back his hair with them. This will help train it back. 2- get it thinned out so you keep volume and it\u2019s easier to style but this will likely prolong your grow out. \n\nYou\u2019ll likely need something heavier than pomade soon for hold while  pomade gives a nice moldable hold it won\u2019t keep your hair from flopping down when it gets too long. I\u2019d mix in some high hold gel with your pomade once it gets to that point \n\nI\u2019m invested in your hair journey now!

Good call on flipping your part, once hair settles on the follicle, gravity takes over and it starts to lay flat so switching up the part helps give it a nice boost of volume. \n\nYoure definitely going to run into it being too heavy and flopping over. So you have two choices. 1- just let it keep growing and love through some awkward stages. I\u2019d use this time to play around with product and styling techniques. I told my cousin every time he washes his hands, take his wet hands and comb back his hair with them. This will help train it back. 2- get it thinned out so you keep volume and it\u2019s easier to style but this will likely prolong your grow out. \n\nYou\u2019ll likely need something heavier than pomade soon for hold while  pomade gives a nice moldable hold it won\u2019t keep your hair from flopping down when it gets too long. I\u2019d mix in some high hold gel with your pomade once it gets to that point \n\nI\u2019m invested in your hair journey now! Haha best of luck and dm me if you ever run into dilemmas or have any questions. I love this stuff!!",

So you have two choices. 1- just let it keep growing and love through some awkward stages. I\u2019d use this time to play around with product and styling techniques. I told my cousin every time he washes his hands, take his wet hands and comb back his hair with them. This will help train it back. 2- get it thinned out so you keep volume and it\u2019s easier to style but this will likely prolong your grow out. \n\nYou\u2019ll likely need something heavier than pomade soon for hold while  pomade gives a nice moldable hold it won\u2019t keep your hair from flopping down when it gets too long. I\u2019d mix in some high hold gel with your pomade once it gets to that point \n\nI\u2019m invested in your hair journey now!
