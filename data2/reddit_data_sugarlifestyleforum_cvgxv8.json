    "body": "Disclaimer: before anyone gets offended and claims I\u2019m promoting inauthenticity, if this advice doesn\u2019t work for you or doesn\u2019t feel authentic, don\u2019t follow it or at least take it with a grain of salt. Just know it works, and most importantly it works no matter what you look like naturally! I have a friend who has very similar features and a very similar body type as mine, and the guys we get approached by are polar opposites. \nAlso this will be long AF oops lol\n\nTHE LOOK\n\nFirst things first, you have to look the part. I\u2019m a fashion student and fairly high maintenance so I\u2019m almost always overdressed, but that isn\u2019t entirely necessary. The main thing to note fashion wise is that anything super trendy won\u2019t work (neon colors, bike shorts, spandex, chunky sneakers, those matching track set type things, overly tacky patterns, etc). You can find clothing that looks good just about anywhere if you\u2019re selective and decent at styling it, but if it LOOKS like it\u2019s clearly from fashion nova or forever 21, burn that shit (but not literally because lord knows what chemical fumes that\u2019ll put into the air and the earth is already fucked enough). Men of means might not be ultra familiar with women\u2019s brands, but they know what fabrics look cheap and how slutty is too slutty lol. If I\u2019m going out, I\u2019ll typically wear a cocktail dress and heels. I went out recently in a bodysuit and jeans and it was uncanny how different the guys that approached me were from the guys who typically do when I\u2019m more dressed up, so dress up! \n\nI like to wear a scent (namely a musky perfume oil because I have very specific taste in scents) but the only tip I have there is not to wear anything too girly or super sweet. No older successful guy thinks it\u2019s sexy when a girl smells like a 13 year old stripper except maybe the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein. Paris Hilton is the only one who can pull it off but she\u2019s already an heiress, we\u2019re only on our way \ud83d\udc85\n\nHair and makeup wise, keep it classic and fairly simple. I\u2019m obsessed with old Hollywood stars so I love a good hot roller set paired with winged eyeliner and a red lip, and guys love it too. Save the super trendy editorial looks for the gay club, something about it just does not register in the minds of men and they will be confused AF if you have blush on your nose and glitter on your cheekbones, especially if they\u2019re older and unfamiliar with whatever makeup looks are trending on Instagram this week. Also keep the falsies somewhat subtle, I\u2019ve heard from like every guy I\u2019ve talked to about makeup about how much they hate the crazy two inch long lashes. Just not flattering or classy. Also biologically, guys always like blushing cheeks, dewy skin, and glossy lips.\n\nLast but certainly not least when it comes to looks: POSTURE. I want to rip out my hot-roller-curled hair when I see a beautiful girl with her shoulders hunched. If you look nervous while you\u2019re just sitting at a regular bar, how are you going to look if he takes you to Nobu or The Plaza? There\u2019s something to be said about posture and the halo effect; people always assume I\u2019m super sure of myself because I have good posture (LOL). Your body language also influences your thoughts and mindset, so if you carry yourself like you know what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll actually start to believe you do (my delusion is a superpower tbh). When I\u2019ve had a bad day or I\u2019m worried everyone is going to notice that my nails are chipped and my hair is frizzy or whatever, I literally channel Samantha Jones with my body language and that shit really does work lol.\n\nPLACES  \n\nGoing to the most expensive bar or restaurant in town is certainly not a bad idea, but keep in mind that that\u2019s not exactly where successful men go to relax. If they\u2019re there, it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re either meeting with a client or business partner or they\u2019re on a date. I can\u2019t give you a cut and dry answer of where all the wealthy men in your city are hiding on a Saturday night, especially because a lot of them are traveling, at their weekend homes, or at events that mere peasants like us aren\u2019t invited to (yet). But once you make a few connections and get your foot in the door of a few well to do social circles, you\u2019ll get a better idea. Even just a successful guy on a date telling you a story about going out with drinks at whatever bar can give you a new idea for somewhere to go. \n\nMy number one tip place wise, though, is that unless you live in a place that has like two successful guys and they\u2019re both hermits, anywhere is a place you can meet successful guys. Not that you should be going to random grocery stores in a cocktail dress with an SA sticker on your chest, but if you follow the rest of the advice here, successful men will start approaching you. \n\nRecently I was at a dive bar (or rather divey enough that the bartender looked at me weird when I ordered a Cosmo) waiting for a friend and happening to look fabulous and I got approached by a banker pretty well known in the city who bought me a drink and asked for my number. Had I been in a tank top, jorts, and flip flops, I could\u2019ve flashed my tits all up and down Wall Street and not gotten a single glance, but when you look like you appreciate the finer things in life, men who can provide them will come to you. \n\nDEMEANOR/BEHAVIOR\n\nFinally, once you\u2019re looking bomb and you\u2019re out somewhere filled with well to do men, what do you do? I like to meet guys while I\u2019m with a friend or two so I\u2019m not just waiting around for someone to talk to me, but either way, don\u2019t be anxiously looking around like you\u2019re waiting for someone to approach you. I\u2019ve gotten the best treatment from guys when I\u2019ve been with my friends having a fun, lively conversation, or by myself but clearly content and relaxed. \n\nYou can approach guys yourself, but I recommend not to. It\u2019s in a man\u2019s nature to chase and the ones who aren\u2019t lazy enjoy doing it, especially if you\u2019re a bit of a challenge. Plus there\u2019s something magical that happens when you look beautiful and classy and your posture is right where you pretty much only get approached by successful men. If you look like you put a lot of effort into your life, men who don\u2019t do the same will not approach you unless they\u2019re super bold (or drunk). \n\nWhen you\u2019re talking to a successful guy, be fun and flirty, but it\u2019s important not to be too nice or easily impressed. If a man needs constant sickly-sweetness and compliments, it\u2019s probably because his manager at TJI Friday\u2019s was yelling at him all day. I\u2019m not suggesting you neg him or anything, but if you have some sass or a bit of an edge, rich men eat that shit up like Gato halibut. Again, being nice and flirtatious: good. Getting on your knees as soon as he tells you he\u2019s a banker or a lawyer: bad. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t mention you\u2019re looking for a SD unless he says something like that first. You can bring that up via text or another time you meet (or never, if you don\u2019t need a consistent allowance and just want gifts and/or bills paid). Just drop hints that you like to be spoiled \u2014 for example, when a guy tells me he works in finance (which is like 95% of the time because I live in manhattan lmao) I like to say \u201coh, so you\u2019re good at buying things? That\u2019ll come in handy with me.\u201d It gets a laugh and sends the message that I\u2019m not looking for something entirely vanilla. But honestly, if you\u2019re a hot younger girl talking to an older rich guy, they\u2019re not exactly expecting to be splitting any checks. \n\nThose are all my tips, I\u2019d love to hear the strategies other SBs use if you like to find guys without always using SA, and SDs - what do you agree with? Disagree with? What responsibilities should I have been attending to instead of writing this long ass thing? Let me know! \n\nTLDR: Dress up and look classy and feminine, avoid overly trendy clothes and makeup, have good posture. Don\u2019t rely on going to the most expensive places, get to know wealthier people and find out where they go, but keep in mind you could find someone anywhere. Don\u2019t be too easily impressed, drop hints that you want to be spoiled.",

Another tip if you\u2019re like me and get nervous/bored at a bar alone and don\u2019t want to be sucked into your phone screen (a bad look), bring something to read or a notepad to write on. It\u2019s a good conversation starter either way. Some guys won\u2019t want to bother you while you\u2019re reading so it\u2019s good to take breaks from that occasionally too. If I bring my notepad it doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m actually writing, I always just say I\u2019m working on an outline for my next project. You can turn \u201cproject\u201d into a million different things depending on what you actually do. Usually I say poetry or painting.",

Never underestimate delusion haha. \n\nHave you not seen the copious amount of old men on Tinder with their age range set down to 18 but 'No SB's or golddiggers!' in their profile/ paunchy, average guys who label themselves as handsome and athletic/ age set at 44 when that was clearly at least 10 years ago?\n\nThat's not to say that the brash approach is a wise one to take. Tact is key but being too coy and expecting he will know what's up because of an age and looks disparity can definitely lead a girl to waste her time on dates with someone who is hoping he's just hit the jackpot.\n\nThis post was a good read though :)",

I was speaking more generally to general delusions and expectations. \n\nMy main point of disagreement is that just because a guy is significantly older does not mean that he will know what's up on a date with someone out of his physical league. Even for wealthy guys, a lot of their reservations are tied up in ego and 'paying for it' regardless of whether they can afford it, is a hill to get over. Showing you the 'finer things in life' could simply mean paying for dinner at nice places. Sugar shouldn't be assumed and any girl who thinks that dating an older, rich man will just naturally evolve into a SR or even a spoiled situation with gifts/ bills needs to prepare herself for disappointment. So little hints like your 'Oh so you're good at buying? That will come in handy with me' are crucial. I think your post is great but light on the conversion to sugar element which is where most girls will struggle.",

Never underestimate delusion haha. \n\nHave you not seen the copious amount of old men on Tinder with their age range set down to 18 but 'No SB's or golddiggers!' in their profile/ paunchy, average guys who label themselves as handsome and athletic/ age set at 44 when that was clearly at least 10 years ago?\n\nThat's not to say that the brash approach is a wise one to take. Tact is key but being too coy and expecting he will know what's up because of an age and looks disparity can definitely lead a girl to waste her time on dates with someone who is hoping he's just hit the jackpot.\n\nThis post was a good read though :)",

I was speaking more generally to general delusions and expectations. \n\nMy main point of disagreement is that just because a guy is significantly older does not mean that he will know what's up on a date with someone out of his physical league. Even for wealthy guys, a lot of their reservations are tied up in ego and 'paying for it' regardless of whether they can afford it, is a hill to get over. Showing you the 'finer things in life' could simply mean paying for dinner at nice places. Sugar shouldn't be assumed and any girl who thinks that dating an older, rich man will just naturally evolve into a SR or even a spoiled situation with gifts/ bills needs to prepare herself for disappointment. So little hints like your 'Oh so you're good at buying? That will come in handy with me' are crucial. I think your post is great but light on the conversion to sugar element which is where most girls will struggle.",

Tact is key but being too coy and expecting he will know what's up because of an age and looks disparity can definitely lead a girl to waste her time on dates with someone who is hoping he's just hit the jackpot.\n\nThis post was a good read though :)",

Guys who can easily afford to have a SB, unless they\u2019re exceptionally handsome or young, will likely be at least interested in the idea because it means dating hotter girls with less commitment. All the rich guys I\u2019ve dated have had the mindset of \u201cwell, I hope you\u2019re just a bit of a gold digger, because that means you\u2019re smart, have high standards, and appreciate my wealth.\u201d Broke guys hate girls who date wealthy guys because they feel entitled to them.",

I was speaking more generally to general delusions and expectations. \n\nMy main point of disagreement is that just because a guy is significantly older does not mean that he will know what's up on a date with someone out of his physical league. Even for wealthy guys, a lot of their reservations are tied up in ego and 'paying for it' regardless of whether they can afford it, is a hill to get over. Showing you the 'finer things in life' could simply mean paying for dinner at nice places. Sugar shouldn't be assumed and any girl who thinks that dating an older, rich man will just naturally evolve into a SR or even a spoiled situation with gifts/ bills needs to prepare herself for disappointment. So little hints like your 'Oh so you're good at buying? That will come in handy with me' are crucial. I think your post is great but light on the conversion to sugar element which is where most girls will struggle.",

I was speaking more generally to general delusions and expectations. \n\nMy main point of disagreement is that just because a guy is significantly older does not mean that he will know what's up on a date with someone out of his physical league. Even for wealthy guys, a lot of their reservations are tied up in ego and 'paying for it' regardless of whether they can afford it, is a hill to get over. Showing you the 'finer things in life' could simply mean paying for dinner at nice places. Sugar shouldn't be assumed and any girl who thinks that dating an older, rich man will just naturally evolve into a SR or even a spoiled situation with gifts/ bills needs to prepare herself for disappointment. So little hints like your 'Oh so you're good at buying? That will come in handy with me' are crucial. I think your post is great but light on the conversion to sugar element which is where most girls will struggle.",

I was speaking more generally to general delusions and expectations. \n\nMy main point of disagreement is that just because a guy is significantly older does not mean that he will know what's up on a date with someone out of his physical league. Even for wealthy guys, a lot of their reservations are tied up in ego and 'paying for it' regardless of whether they can afford it, is a hill to get over. Showing you the 'finer things in life' could simply mean paying for dinner at nice places. Sugar shouldn't be assumed and any girl who thinks that dating an older, rich man will just naturally evolve into a SR or even a spoiled situation with gifts/ bills needs to prepare herself for disappointment. So little hints like your 'Oh so you're good at buying? That will come in handy with me' are crucial. I think your post is great but light on the conversion to sugar element which is where most girls will struggle.",
