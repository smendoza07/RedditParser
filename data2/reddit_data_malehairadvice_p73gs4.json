As for the differences, from an artistic standpoint, the beard is much more full than the hair, making an already balanced face look rounder, bottom heavy, and wider.  Though also-- keep in mind that it looks good because it is well done and is by no means bad, just that the human eye prefers proportional features. If you had a shorter beard, this would be a perfect professional look.\n\nWith the beard as-is, B better balances the proportions of the face, as the fullness of the hair up top balances out the fullness of the beard on bottom. This paired with the side part and asymmetrical hair volume swooping across the face narrows, elongates, and balanced the features as well as highlighting your optimal features: your cheekbones and browline.\n\nTl;dr: second haircut makes monkey brain go oonga boonga",

It's made by Ricky Gervais and it's a mockumentary style comedy following a fictionalised version of real life actor Warwick Davis, a British actor who has Dwarfism. In real life he's one of the nicest guys ever, but in the show the fictionalised version of him is selfish, insecure, egotistical, and gets himself into ridiculous situations.\n\nBecause actors want to work with Ricky Gervais, it has lots of really funny celebrity appearances with people like Johnny Depp, Steve Carell, and Liam Neeson (the best one) playing fictionalised versions of themselves that end up looking ridiculous. The Neeson episode is absolute gold, especially if you enjoy awkwardness, inappropriateness, and/or cringe in comedy like The Office, Extras, etc.",

Don't want to sound full of myself, but basically any time I've become single, I've had women pursuing a relationship with me. Most of them were great girls and not really the kind you would turn down... so I haven't really been single much in my adult life. Personally, I like being in a relationship, and regular sex with someone attractive that you genuinely like/love is just one reason I like being in a relationship.\n\nAlso, I'm 38 years old.... but trust me when I say you'll still be jerking off when you're older, when you're in a relationship, and even when you're happily married to an absolute babe. We're men. Jerking off is just something we do brother! Haha. Having a great and fulfilling sex life doesn't mean you're not jerking off as well.",

The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",

I usually do a fade like in photo A, and this is the first time in my life I've tried growing my hair longer. Mine wasn't pandemic related, but I agree... nobody is going to harass men for having long hair these days.\n\nI never tried growing my hair longer only because I thought it wouldn't suit me at all. Most people have said it suits me longer, so it was really helpful for me to get that feedback. I'll check out Fierce Flow for some inspiration!\n\nThanks again for your thoughtful response mate.",

I have cut my own hair for the past 11 years or so.... I was well prepared for Covid. It started because I always had to \"fix\" the shitty $10 haircuts I got. I eventually just figured I could do a better job than barbers because I knew how my hair grows, and I was right.\n\nHere are some photos of [Haircut B from some other angles](http://imgur.com/a/fdxq99U).",

As for the differences, from an artistic standpoint, the beard is much more full than the hair, making an already balanced face look rounder, bottom heavy, and wider.  Though also-- keep in mind that it looks good because it is well done and is by no means bad, just that the human eye prefers proportional features. If you had a shorter beard, this would be a perfect professional look.\n\nWith the beard as-is, B better balances the proportions of the face, as the fullness of the hair up top balances out the fullness of the beard on bottom. This paired with the side part and asymmetrical hair volume swooping across the face narrows, elongates, and balanced the features as well as highlighting your optimal features: your cheekbones and browline.\n\nTl;dr: second haircut makes monkey brain go oonga boonga",

It's made by Ricky Gervais and it's a mockumentary style comedy following a fictionalised version of real life actor Warwick Davis, a British actor who has Dwarfism. In real life he's one of the nicest guys ever, but in the show the fictionalised version of him is selfish, insecure, egotistical, and gets himself into ridiculous situations.\n\nBecause actors want to work with Ricky Gervais, it has lots of really funny celebrity appearances with people like Johnny Depp, Steve Carell, and Liam Neeson (the best one) playing fictionalised versions of themselves that end up looking ridiculous. The Neeson episode is absolute gold, especially if you enjoy awkwardness, inappropriateness, and/or cringe in comedy like The Office, Extras, etc.",

The first three are all the same length as photo B, but the last one is a little bit longer and taken last week.\n\nTo answer your question.... yes. Yes to both. The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",

I usually do a fade like in photo A, and this is the first time in my life I've tried growing my hair longer. Mine wasn't pandemic related, but I agree... nobody is going to harass men for having long hair these days.\n\nI never tried growing my hair longer only because I thought it wouldn't suit me at all. Most people have said it suits me longer, so it was really helpful for me to get that feedback. I'll check out Fierce Flow for some inspiration!\n\nThanks again for your thoughtful response mate.",

As for the differences, from an artistic standpoint, the beard is much more full than the hair, making an already balanced face look rounder, bottom heavy, and wider.  Though also-- keep in mind that it looks good because it is well done and is by no means bad, just that the human eye prefers proportional features. If you had a shorter beard, this would be a perfect professional look.\n\nWith the beard as-is, B better balances the proportions of the face, as the fullness of the hair up top balances out the fullness of the beard on bottom. This paired with the side part and asymmetrical hair volume swooping across the face narrows, elongates, and balanced the features as well as highlighting your optimal features: your cheekbones and browline.\n\nTl;dr: second haircut makes monkey brain go oonga boonga",

It's made by Ricky Gervais and it's a mockumentary style comedy following a fictionalised version of real life actor Warwick Davis, a British actor who has Dwarfism. In real life he's one of the nicest guys ever, but in the show the fictionalised version of him is selfish, insecure, egotistical, and gets himself into ridiculous situations.\n\nBecause actors want to work with Ricky Gervais, it has lots of really funny celebrity appearances with people like Johnny Depp, Steve Carell, and Liam Neeson (the best one) playing fictionalised versions of themselves that end up looking ridiculous. The Neeson episode is absolute gold, especially if you enjoy awkwardness, inappropriateness, and/or cringe in comedy like The Office, Extras, etc.",

Personally, I like being in a relationship, and regular sex with someone attractive that you genuinely like/love is just one reason I like being in a relationship.\n\nAlso, I'm 38 years old.... but trust me when I say you'll still be jerking off when you're older, when you're in a relationship, and even when you're happily married to an absolute babe. We're men. Jerking off is just something we do brother! Haha. Having a great and fulfilling sex life doesn't mean you're not jerking off as well.",

The first three are all the same length as photo B, but the last one is a little bit longer and taken last week.\n\nTo answer your question.... yes. Yes to both. The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",

In real life he's one of the nicest guys ever, but in the show the fictionalised version of him is selfish, insecure, egotistical, and gets himself into ridiculous situations.\n\nBecause actors want to work with Ricky Gervais, it has lots of really funny celebrity appearances with people like Johnny Depp, Steve Carell, and Liam Neeson (the best one) playing fictionalised versions of themselves that end up looking ridiculous. The Neeson episode is absolute gold, especially if you enjoy awkwardness, inappropriateness, and/or cringe in comedy like The Office, Extras, etc.",

We're men. Jerking off is just something we do brother! Haha. Having a great and fulfilling sex life doesn't mean you're not jerking off as well.",

The first three are all the same length as photo B, but the last one is a little bit longer and taken last week.\n\nTo answer your question.... yes. Yes to both. The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",

It's made by Ricky Gervais and it's a mockumentary style comedy following a fictionalised version of real life actor Warwick Davis, a British actor who has Dwarfism. In real life he's one of the nicest guys ever, but in the show the fictionalised version of him is selfish, insecure, egotistical, and gets himself into ridiculous situations.\n\nBecause actors want to work with Ricky Gervais, it has lots of really funny celebrity appearances with people like Johnny Depp, Steve Carell, and Liam Neeson (the best one) playing fictionalised versions of themselves that end up looking ridiculous. The Neeson episode is absolute gold, especially if you enjoy awkwardness, inappropriateness, and/or cringe in comedy like The Office, Extras, etc.",

Personally, I like being in a relationship, and regular sex with someone attractive that you genuinely like/love is just one reason I like being in a relationship.\n\nAlso, I'm 38 years old.... but trust me when I say you'll still be jerking off when you're older, when you're in a relationship, and even when you're happily married to an absolute babe. We're men. Jerking off is just something we do brother! Haha. Having a great and fulfilling sex life doesn't mean you're not jerking off as well.",

The first three are all the same length as photo B, but the last one is a little bit longer and taken last week.\n\nTo answer your question.... yes. Yes to both. The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",

It's made by Ricky Gervais and it's a mockumentary style comedy following a fictionalised version of real life actor Warwick Davis, a British actor who has Dwarfism. In real life he's one of the nicest guys ever, but in the show the fictionalised version of him is selfish, insecure, egotistical, and gets himself into ridiculous situations.\n\nBecause actors want to work with Ricky Gervais, it has lots of really funny celebrity appearances with people like Johnny Depp, Steve Carell, and Liam Neeson (the best one) playing fictionalised versions of themselves that end up looking ridiculous. The Neeson episode is absolute gold, especially if you enjoy awkwardness, inappropriateness, and/or cringe in comedy like The Office, Extras, etc.",

Most of them were great girls and not really the kind you would turn down... so I haven't really been single much in my adult life. Personally, I like being in a relationship, and regular sex with someone attractive that you genuinely like/love is just one reason I like being in a relationship.\n\nAlso, I'm 38 years old.... but trust me when I say you'll still be jerking off when you're older, when you're in a relationship, and even when you're happily married to an absolute babe. We're men. Jerking off is just something we do brother! Haha. Having a great and fulfilling sex life doesn't mean you're not jerking off as well.",

The first three are all the same length as photo B, but the last one is a little bit longer and taken last week.\n\nTo answer your question.... yes. Yes to both. The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",

The first three are all the same length as photo B, but the last one is a little bit longer and taken last week.\n\nTo answer your question.... yes. Yes to both. The sides are a little bit shorter and I also swept the sides back a bit. I grew it out from my usual self-cut fade which was photo A, so the sides are always shorter than the top because of that. I've always cut my own hair (not because of Covid) for the past ten years or so, because I found I always had to \"fix\" whatever the barber did... and eventually thought \"fuck it, I can probably get a better result if I just do the whole haircut myself\".\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out how to do it, and I now know how my hair grows... and therefore how to cut it the way I like it to be. My hair is very thick and grows really quickly, so doing it myself has saved me A LOT of money over the years!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want some specific tips on how to get your hair to look like any of my photos. Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.",
