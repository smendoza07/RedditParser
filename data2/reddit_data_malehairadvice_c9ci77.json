After a year during winters, my hair started falling rapidly and even after using anti dandruff shampoos, i couldn't get rid of the dandruff. I used to do home remedies like applying oil and other stuff, got it under control, until a few months back(18 then) when i shifted to another place, my hairfall started again (mainly because of the hard water we got).\n\n\nHonestly saying, this hairfall thing depresses you a lot. Right now(18) i have lesser hair than my father and i honestly regret a lot. Shit's depressing man.",

Some buy the 5mg and cut them up. HIMS now sells fin for a shit ton of money, but a prescription is dirt cheap.\n2.\tMinoxidil. This is the chemical within Rogain. You apply it to your head 1-2 times a day. There's a foam version and syrup-y version. Minox-beards are also a thing, especially for trans guys. Anywhere you put minox, hair will grow (which means that you shouldn't hug women, especially pregnant women, when using). \n3.\tDermarolling. Dermapens are the go-to device. Somehow, poking tiny holes into the skin on your heads stimulates hair growth.\n\nResults of course very person to person. Something like 1% of men get rough side effects from fin. Some men experience hair regrowth. Others just experience less balding (shedding). Others don't see any progress at all.",

I will say that they need to go the prescription route, as a doctor can prescribe and evaluate overtime as finasteride is a DHT Blocker, and people tend to forget that messing with hormones at such a crucial developmental time in their life can have life altering results. \n\n2. Minoxidil can help, but as it is only a low level DHT blocker itself, it can only stimulate growth in already opened follicles. If time passes and the follicles close, there is a good chance they won't produce anymore. It won't make hair appear, but only stimulate growth where growth was already possible.\n\n3. I may actually check this out, this one is new to me.\n\nI have a massive hormone deficiency and have to take Testosterone, estrogen blockers, DHT for side effects, and more.

And children need DHT as its an important growth (maturity) hormone. \n\nThe post was about minoxidil which is sold as an alcohol based solution with a small percentage of that being actual minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodialator not a DHT blocker, so the effects of exposure arent as bad or gender dependant. Minoxidil can still be harmful if mis managed but you dont need to shun human contact if your using it, like the poster was asking about.\n\n\nHowever I'm just an armchair researcher, if your phramasy program has taught you otherwise please let me know so i can edit my post accordingly",

Start working on it early and get some sun on your scalp so your skin tones match.\n\nIf this is the route you go, I would also say that you should kick your aerobics in gear.

            "body": "Definitely thinning man. It's rare at your age but it does happen. I had a friend in college who was 20 and had about half the amount of hair you do. He was tormented for it endlessly. I always felt bad for the guy and left him alone. I had a birthmark on my arm that some people back then made fun of me for, but they aren't around anymore. Anyways, eventually my friend just embraced the shave and looked fine. You don't appear to be at that point yet, but trust me when or if the time comes it's better to shave it than look like a cancer patient perpetually in chemo. \n\nSee a dermatologist if you can afford it. Alternatively, kidnap a dermatologist and force them to experiment on you until they can regrow your hair. Do not accept no for an answer because they can do it if they're good. It's important you stake out this dermatologist a day or two before you abduct them to see where he/she lives so you can threaten to hurt their family if they refuse to cooperate. Take pictures on your phone of their house or kids/wife/dog. \n\nYou could also rent a storage unit if you want and tie their family up inside the unit for extra leverage just make sure you pay cash. You can usually slip a 20 to whoever is working at the time and they won't enter your ID. Just tell them you just signed a lease for an apartment but can't move in until monday and only need the unit for the weekend anyways. Have the family rolled and tied up inside some rugs so it just looks like you're storing some decor. If you do this MAKE SURE you tape their mouths shut with duct tape so they cannot vocalize. Most storage facilities only have workers present Monday through Friday so rent the unit on Friday then bring the family after the workers have left for the weekend. \n\nIf the dermatologists office is closed on the weekend then Friday after they close would be a good time to kidnap them so then they have a secluded place to work on you without arising much suspicion. DO NOT let them inject you with anything as they could be a smarty pants trying to sedate you and then you're in jail and balding. Assure the doctor he is safe the entire time he experiments on you to regrow your hair, but don't worry we just want him to remain calm and able to focus on regrowing our hair. At the end no matter the outcome you should \"take care\" of him since he's likely seen your face at this point. When cleaning blood/dna keep in mind you need bleach with an oxygen cleaning agent in it. A lot of people think regular bleach destroys DNA evidence. It will destroy most but not all so get something like oxiclean if you want to do it right. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",

Go to a dermatologist and get tested to see why you are loosing your hair, it could be diet, could be your thyroid, could be something other than male pattern baldness (you appear to have a diffuse pattern). If you do have mpb shaving it off can give you a lot of confidence back, but there are ways of giving your hair the best shot it can get to grow back and stay put, even if those ways aren't guarantees. \n\nBe careful with the tressless subreddit those guys are very...intenese at times, though it can be good to read posts of others going through the same thing. You arent alone after all!\n\nI wish you the best of luck on whichever path you choose, let me know if you have any questions!",

I also had an elderly client with hair that felt very rough and thin and I recommended she try that supplement as well. On her 4th appointment(around 4 -6 weeks) I noticed  her hair looking full and feeling soft, I asked her what she had been doing and she said she started that supplement I had told her about. Both her and my instructor said it can cause an upset stomach so they would take it with food. Balding can be caused by other things and not just male pattern baldness. Maybe that\u2019s the case in your situation.",

I was able to notice it because I was so analytical about everything, I always noticed small changes... I didnt tell anyone because I knew they wouldnt believe me , fast forward to about 20 and it had become more obvious that people actually believed me when I told them. I feared I would lose it all by 25, but I'm now 30 and I still have a decent amount of hair left , enough to were some people cant notice it unless they look at my crown area which is where it's the most obvious. \n\nTruth be told to start losing hair at a teen is not un heard of . Sometimes it's can be due to a health condition , there are many reasons so it's best to go get checked. And other times it's simply just male pattern baldness and theres nearly nothing you can do about it... that's the harsh truth , my wife's cousin was receding as a teen and was fully bald by 20. I've also met people who told me the same thing , bald by 20... theres a famous celebrity I think his name is Ricky Tambor? He was on Arrested Development , he said he was going bald at 16, my cousins as well are young and are receding... it's just genetics sometimes. \n\nHow fast it goes is the real question ... sometimes its quick other times it takes years and years...",

If it\u2019s really worth it for you then go ahead I suppose. For about a year, maybe two, I tried supplements, different haircuts, hats, etc. \n\nEventually I just figured why prolong the inevitable, can\u2019t fight nature. Made it my new year resolution (the only one I\u2019ve ever followed thru on) and shaved it all down, kept on it about every two days since. \n\nGoing bald isn\u2019t the end of the world man. Only thing I miss about hair is having something to hold the sweat at bay. Otherwise I love it. I gauged my ears (to a 00, nothing obnoxious), bought some bolder glasses and grew out the mustache and goatee combo to break up a bit of the monotony of having all of that skin from the shirt up. Those are changes I probably wouldn\u2019t have made if I still had my hair because I never would\u2019ve felt the need to. In the end I took going bald as a chance to reinvent, and I suggest to everyone in the same situation to just make the best of it, make the change and try something different. I was cool with how I looked then but I love how I look now. \n\nJust my two cents.",

I\u2019ve never used it as I wasn\u2019t that bad but your best bet is to cut your hair a bit shorter and use matte product (clay and a blowdryer makes hair look full). Shine or wetness shows your scalp. If not, own it and shave it then lift weights and be a tough guy. I had to do that when I shaved my head to compensate, and it works.",

Some buy the 5mg and cut them up. HIMS now sells fin for a shit ton of money, but a prescription is dirt cheap.\n2.\tMinoxidil. This is the chemical within Rogain. You apply it to your head 1-2 times a day. There's a foam version and syrup-y version. Minox-beards are also a thing, especially for trans guys. Anywhere you put minox, hair will grow (which means that you shouldn't hug women, especially pregnant women, when using). \n3.\tDermarolling. Dermapens are the go-to device. Somehow, poking tiny holes into the skin on your heads stimulates hair growth.\n\nResults of course very person to person. Something like 1% of men get rough side effects from fin. Some men experience hair regrowth. Others just experience less balding (shedding). Others don't see any progress at all.",

I will say that they need to go the prescription route, as a doctor can prescribe and evaluate overtime as finasteride is a DHT Blocker, and people tend to forget that messing with hormones at such a crucial developmental time in their life can have life altering results. \n\n2. Minoxidil can help, but as it is only a low level DHT blocker itself, it can only stimulate growth in already opened follicles. If time passes and the follicles close, there is a good chance they won't produce anymore. It won't make hair appear, but only stimulate growth where growth was already possible.\n\n3. I may actually check this out, this one is new to me.\n\nI have a massive hormone deficiency and have to take Testosterone, estrogen blockers, DHT for side effects, and more.

And children need DHT as its an important growth (maturity) hormone. \n\nThe post was about minoxidil which is sold as an alcohol based solution with a small percentage of that being actual minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodialator not a DHT blocker, so the effects of exposure arent as bad or gender dependant. Minoxidil can still be harmful if mis managed but you dont need to shun human contact if your using it, like the poster was asking about.\n\n\nHowever I'm just an armchair researcher, if your phramasy program has taught you otherwise please let me know so i can edit my post accordingly",

Start working on it early and get some sun on your scalp so your skin tones match.\n\nIf this is the route you go, I would also say that you should kick your aerobics in gear.

Some buy the 5mg and cut them up. HIMS now sells fin for a shit ton of money, but a prescription is dirt cheap.\n2.\tMinoxidil. This is the chemical within Rogain. You apply it to your head 1-2 times a day. There's a foam version and syrup-y version. Minox-beards are also a thing, especially for trans guys. Anywhere you put minox, hair will grow (which means that you shouldn't hug women, especially pregnant women, when using). \n3.\tDermarolling. Dermapens are the go-to device. Somehow, poking tiny holes into the skin on your heads stimulates hair growth.\n\nResults of course very person to person. Something like 1% of men get rough side effects from fin. Some men experience hair regrowth. Others just experience less balding (shedding). Others don't see any progress at all.",

I will say that they need to go the prescription route, as a doctor can prescribe and evaluate overtime as finasteride is a DHT Blocker, and people tend to forget that messing with hormones at such a crucial developmental time in their life can have life altering results. \n\n2. Minoxidil can help, but as it is only a low level DHT blocker itself, it can only stimulate growth in already opened follicles. If time passes and the follicles close, there is a good chance they won't produce anymore. It won't make hair appear, but only stimulate growth where growth was already possible.\n\n3. I may actually check this out, this one is new to me.\n\nI have a massive hormone deficiency and have to take Testosterone, estrogen blockers, DHT for side effects, and more.

And children need DHT as its an important growth (maturity) hormone. \n\nThe post was about minoxidil which is sold as an alcohol based solution with a small percentage of that being actual minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodialator not a DHT blocker, so the effects of exposure arent as bad or gender dependant. Minoxidil can still be harmful if mis managed but you dont need to shun human contact if your using it, like the poster was asking about.\n\n\nHowever I'm just an armchair researcher, if your phramasy program has taught you otherwise please let me know so i can edit my post accordingly",

Some buy the 5mg and cut them up. HIMS now sells fin for a shit ton of money, but a prescription is dirt cheap.\n2.\tMinoxidil. This is the chemical within Rogain. You apply it to your head 1-2 times a day. There's a foam version and syrup-y version. Minox-beards are also a thing, especially for trans guys. Anywhere you put minox, hair will grow (which means that you shouldn't hug women, especially pregnant women, when using). \n3.\tDermarolling. Dermapens are the go-to device. Somehow, poking tiny holes into the skin on your heads stimulates hair growth.\n\nResults of course very person to person. Something like 1% of men get rough side effects from fin. Some men experience hair regrowth. Others just experience less balding (shedding). Others don't see any progress at all.",

I will say that they need to go the prescription route, as a doctor can prescribe and evaluate overtime as finasteride is a DHT Blocker, and people tend to forget that messing with hormones at such a crucial developmental time in their life can have life altering results. \n\n2. Minoxidil can help, but as it is only a low level DHT blocker itself, it can only stimulate growth in already opened follicles. If time passes and the follicles close, there is a good chance they won't produce anymore. It won't make hair appear, but only stimulate growth where growth was already possible.\n\n3. I may actually check this out, this one is new to me.\n\nI have a massive hormone deficiency and have to take Testosterone, estrogen blockers, DHT for side effects, and more. Losing my hair up top, while actually having some moderate success with Minoxidil for the beard.",

And children need DHT as its an important growth (maturity) hormone. \n\nThe post was about minoxidil which is sold as an alcohol based solution with a small percentage of that being actual minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodialator not a DHT blocker, so the effects of exposure arent as bad or gender dependant. Minoxidil can still be harmful if mis managed but you dont need to shun human contact if your using it, like the poster was asking about.\n\n\nHowever I'm just an armchair researcher, if your phramasy program has taught you otherwise please let me know so i can edit my post accordingly",

I will say that they need to go the prescription route, as a doctor can prescribe and evaluate overtime as finasteride is a DHT Blocker, and people tend to forget that messing with hormones at such a crucial developmental time in their life can have life altering results. \n\n2. Minoxidil can help, but as it is only a low level DHT blocker itself, it can only stimulate growth in already opened follicles. If time passes and the follicles close, there is a good chance they won't produce anymore. It won't make hair appear, but only stimulate growth where growth was already possible.\n\n3. I may actually check this out, this one is new to me.\n\nI have a massive hormone deficiency and have to take Testosterone, estrogen blockers, DHT for side effects, and more.

And children need DHT as its an important growth (maturity) hormone. \n\nThe post was about minoxidil which is sold as an alcohol based solution with a small percentage of that being actual minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodialator not a DHT blocker, so the effects of exposure arent as bad or gender dependant. Minoxidil can still be harmful if mis managed but you dont need to shun human contact if your using it, like the poster was asking about.\n\n\nHowever I'm just an armchair researcher, if your phramasy program has taught you otherwise please let me know so i can edit my post accordingly",
