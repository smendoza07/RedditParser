So many young kids who probably had no clue how to navigate crowds like that... especially since the last 3 years- there weren't major festivals or things to prepare for that sorta crowd. I also can't imagine the trauma from having been in that crown and having survived it- when you couldn't do much to help or if you were drunk/unaware of the tragedy and just enjoying Halloween debauchery without knowing what was happening!

It was estimated 100k people turned up since it's the first event there post-pandemic measures, in a neighbourhood with clubs in tiny alleyways. There was police arranged but they were woefully underprepared and didn't control the crowd before the tipping point came, so they're going to come under massive fire in the coming days. \n\nI don't recommend finding videos of the event, there's a lot because the area was swarmed with techsavvy youngsters in their 20s filming everything from every angle - but if you want to go to a crowded event again in the near future it's not a good idea for your sanity.",

Just watching that made me take a deep breathe. People who have asthma or a medical condition AND drank alcohol, it's bound to happen that they go into a shock. They can't breathe and that's dangerous for the heart and brain. 151 dead in a crowd of 100.000. It was meant to happen. 100.000 is just too extreme of a number for a small street like itaewon. I blame the people who went despite seeing it's crowded and also the authorities. But mostly the people. It was too dangerous. Dead bodies laid down on the streets with blankets on top of them. That was just too hard to watch.",

And how would they know that 100.000 people would crowd a SMALL street? Even if you plan something, like a concert, the problem is the crowd. If I go to a festival and there is even a bit more than 1000 ppl, I'm TURNING AWAY. but this was 100.000 people in one small street. Imagine those huge concert halls but much more. You can plan all you want but if dumb people want to still join the crowd that already overcrowded then that's on you. Keeping 100.000 people in check is IMPOSSIBLE. Even if it were to be planned and police sent out. Its just so maddening that young lives were lost cuz they wanted to party and didn't care. Their families will be the ones in pain now.

I think korean people respect \"ques\" since they are more conservative and respectful when theres such rules in place.\n\nIf it was just a random gathering, than Im more surprised that huge amount of people still forced themselves through the crowd. \n\nAnyway, i dont think i should be placing blame on anyone involved considering how big of a tragedy this had been.",

Who knows why there were no set plans in place for that, especially since itaewon is also a small area, maybe it was because the cops were understaffed.\n\nAlso, for anyone blaming the individuals there for what happened, I *highly* encourage you to look into what a [crowd crush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes) is, and how they work/happen. ([Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pcvfb/comment/cw5vxtm/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) explaining the dynamics of it.) This happened at Astroworld too. \n\nVictims in a crowd crush are *panicking* and lose control of their own movement because the extreme high density of a crowd crush means that the crowd starts behaving as a fluid. You can not blame people\u2019s behavior during a crowd crush because they can barely move of their own volition during one. It\u2019s horrible.\n\nEdit: wording + [another](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided) article",

Are they screaming from excitement? Is it just the general noise and racket from a bunch of people in the same area celebrating a holiday? If everyone is screaming how can you hear the words they\u2019re saying? So the people in the back continue to casually move forward, unknowingly pushing up against the people in the middle who start to crush the people in the front, and if you\u2019re in a situation where you know what\u2019s going on, it might be too late for you to get out of it.\n\nEdit: [some comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ygqlo3/at_least_120_dead_after_stampede_during_halloween/iua9347/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",

In the end when the rescue operation was up and going they were trying to pull people out of the wall and struggling so much with every single person.

It was estimated 100k people turned up since it's the first event there post-pandemic measures, in a neighbourhood with clubs in tiny alleyways. There was police arranged but they were woefully underprepared and didn't control the crowd before the tipping point came, so they're going to come under massive fire in the coming days. \n\nI don't recommend finding videos of the event, there's a lot because the area was swarmed with techsavvy youngsters in their 20s filming everything from every angle - but if you want to go to a crowded event again in the near future it's not a good idea for your sanity.",

They can't breathe and that's dangerous for the heart and brain. 151 dead in a crowd of 100.000. It was meant to happen. 100.000 is just too extreme of a number for a small street like itaewon. I blame the people who went despite seeing it's crowded and also the authorities. But mostly the people. It was too dangerous. Dead bodies laid down on the streets with blankets on top of them. That was just too hard to watch.",

If I go to a festival and there is even a bit more than 1000 ppl, I'm TURNING AWAY. but this was 100.000 people in one small street. Imagine those huge concert halls but much more. You can plan all you want but if dumb people want to still join the crowd that already overcrowded then that's on you. Keeping 100.000 people in check is IMPOSSIBLE. Even if it were to be planned and police sent out. Its just so maddening that young lives were lost cuz they wanted to party and didn't care. Their families will be the ones in pain now.

I think korean people respect \"ques\" since they are more conservative and respectful when theres such rules in place.\n\nIf it was just a random gathering, than Im more surprised that huge amount of people still forced themselves through the crowd. \n\nAnyway, i dont think i should be placing blame on anyone involved considering how big of a tragedy this had been.",

Who knows why there were no set plans in place for that, especially since itaewon is also a small area, maybe it was because the cops were understaffed.\n\nAlso, for anyone blaming the individuals there for what happened, I *highly* encourage you to look into what a [crowd crush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes) is, and how they work/happen. ([Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pcvfb/comment/cw5vxtm/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) explaining the dynamics of it.) This happened at Astroworld too. \n\nVictims in a crowd crush are *panicking* and lose control of their own movement because the extreme high density of a crowd crush means that the crowd starts behaving as a fluid. You can not blame people\u2019s behavior during a crowd crush because they can barely move of their own volition during one. It\u2019s horrible.\n\nEdit: wording + [another](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided) article",

I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who\u2019ve been there say that it can be hard to navigate around Itaewon since it\u2019s a popular gathering place with small alleys, and something like this hasn\u2019t happened yet. \n\n No one individual could\u2019ve imagined that this night would\u2019ve been any different to previous years.\n\nThere\u2019s *no way* people in the back of a crowd could reasonably know what\u2019s happening in the front or middle. Are they screaming from excitement? Is it just the general noise and racket from a bunch of people in the same area celebrating a holiday? If everyone is screaming how can you hear the words they\u2019re saying? So the people in the back continue to casually move forward, unknowingly pushing up against the people in the middle who start to crush the people in the front, and if you\u2019re in a situation where you know what\u2019s going on, it might be too late for you to get out of it.\n\nEdit: [some comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ygqlo3/at_least_120_dead_after_stampede_during_halloween/iua9347/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",

In the end when the rescue operation was up and going they were trying to pull people out of the wall and struggling so much with every single person.

There was police arranged but they were woefully underprepared and didn't control the crowd before the tipping point came, so they're going to come under massive fire in the coming days. \n\nI don't recommend finding videos of the event, there's a lot because the area was swarmed with techsavvy youngsters in their 20s filming everything from every angle - but if you want to go to a crowded event again in the near future it's not a good idea for your sanity.",

If I go to a festival and there is even a bit more than 1000 ppl, I'm TURNING AWAY. but this was 100.000 people in one small street. Imagine those huge concert halls but much more. You can plan all you want but if dumb people want to still join the crowd that already overcrowded then that's on you. Keeping 100.000 people in check is IMPOSSIBLE.

Who knows why there were no set plans in place for that, especially since itaewon is also a small area, maybe it was because the cops were understaffed.\n\nAlso, for anyone blaming the individuals there for what happened, I *highly* encourage you to look into what a [crowd crush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes) is, and how they work/happen. ([Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pcvfb/comment/cw5vxtm/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) explaining the dynamics of it.) This happened at Astroworld too. \n\nVictims in a crowd crush are *panicking* and lose control of their own movement because the extreme high density of a crowd crush means that the crowd starts behaving as a fluid. You can not blame people\u2019s behavior during a crowd crush because they can barely move of their own volition during one. It\u2019s horrible.\n\nEdit: wording + [another](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided) article",

Who knows why there were no set plans in place for that, especially since itaewon is also a small area, maybe it was because the cops were understaffed.\n\nAlso, for anyone blaming the individuals there for what happened, I *highly* encourage you to look into what a [crowd crush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes) is, and how they work/happen. ([Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pcvfb/comment/cw5vxtm/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) explaining the dynamics of it.) This happened at Astroworld too. \n\nVictims in a crowd crush are *panicking* and lose control of their own movement because the extreme high density of a crowd crush means that the crowd starts behaving as a fluid. You can not blame people\u2019s behavior during a crowd crush because they can barely move of their own volition during one. It\u2019s horrible.\n\nEdit: wording + [another](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided) article",

Are they screaming from excitement? Is it just the general noise and racket from a bunch of people in the same area celebrating a holiday? If everyone is screaming how can you hear the words they\u2019re saying? So the people in the back continue to casually move forward, unknowingly pushing up against the people in the middle who start to crush the people in the front, and if you\u2019re in a situation where you know what\u2019s going on, it might be too late for you to get out of it.\n\nEdit: [some comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ygqlo3/at_least_120_dead_after_stampede_during_halloween/iua9347/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",

Who knows why there were no set plans in place for that, especially since itaewon is also a small area, maybe it was because the cops were understaffed.\n\nAlso, for anyone blaming the individuals there for what happened, I *highly* encourage you to look into what a [crowd crush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes) is, and how they work/happen. ([Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pcvfb/comment/cw5vxtm/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) explaining the dynamics of it.) This happened at Astroworld too. \n\nVictims in a crowd crush are *panicking* and lose control of their own movement because the extreme high density of a crowd crush means that the crowd starts behaving as a fluid. You can not blame people\u2019s behavior during a crowd crush because they can barely move of their own volition during one. It\u2019s horrible.\n\nEdit: wording + [another](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/hajj-crush-how-crowd-disasters-happen-and-how-they-can-be-avoided) article",

If everyone is screaming how can you hear the words they\u2019re saying? So the people in the back continue to casually move forward, unknowingly pushing up against the people in the middle who start to crush the people in the front, and if you\u2019re in a situation where you know what\u2019s going on, it might be too late for you to get out of it.\n\nEdit: [some comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ygqlo3/at_least_120_dead_after_stampede_during_halloween/iua9347/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",

If I go to a festival and there is even a bit more than 1000 ppl, I'm TURNING AWAY. but this was 100.000 people in one small street. Imagine those huge concert halls but much more. You can plan all you want but if dumb people want to still join the crowd that already overcrowded then that's on you. Keeping 100.000 people in check is IMPOSSIBLE. Even if it were to be planned and police sent out. Its just so maddening that young lives were lost cuz they wanted to party and didn't care. Their families will be the ones in pain now.

I think korean people respect \"ques\" since they are more conservative and respectful when theres such rules in place.\n\nIf it was just a random gathering, than Im more surprised that huge amount of people still forced themselves through the crowd. \n\nAnyway, i dont think i should be placing blame on anyone involved considering how big of a tragedy this had been.",

That is bound to happen in that density of people. \n\nThe issue is before it escalates to that point, people didnt managed to judge how crowded the area had been and still choose to remain/proceed with whatever was happening. \n\nI would like to clarify, I wasnt at the area nor had been there before, but i assume the situation to be similar to a crowded train situation where people would push themselves in without waiting for enough people to get out.\n\nI feel like it was an avoidable tragedy, if people could make a rational decision watching that amount of people from a far and stay away from it.",

I'm sure many people ignored the screams and just thought it was funny to join in and squeeze people. How can you not see any fault in the crowd.",
