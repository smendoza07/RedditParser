They are nice, but money is even nicer cause it allows you the freedom to save, invest or simply buy yourself whatever you want.\n\nNow that some are happy with 300 PPM and others only with 1K it's individual and shouldn't be upped on debate.\nBut most of the times when money is tight many compromise and take even less than what they want so not right to glorify women who take low allowances either cause many time it's a sign of desperation. When the roof over your head is in danger or you can't pay bills of course you accept whatever you can get while the ones who have money to cover basic needs of their own can afford to turn down a lower allowance and wait till they get the desired one.\n\nSo this is kinda double edged sword. If they could collect higher allowances they would. I doubt they would turn it down just because they only need 200 or 300. Let's be real! And when someone helps you to further your goals or helps you get out of some bad situation of course you are grateful for the help. It's only human to feel that way...",

But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

For what purpose do they *need* to if sugaring was just an auxiliary income? I didn't mean to imply that you were lazy or snobby. That being said, I can honestly say that I have done fine with SBs here in NYC at 300-400 and that asking me for more than 400 has only happened once. Whether they have or have not had other SDs as well is not even any of my business really. Just as it is not theirs to know if I have other SBs (unless we were to specifically decide on exclusivity, which I haven't asked for).",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

For you 300-400 isn't enough because you'd rather earn it another way in that case (or hold out for a wealthier SD). OK, fine.

Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

As humans in romantic relationships, we are not nor should we be viewed as commodities, who have a certain \u201cvalue\u201d (which, from this perspective, also means the \u201cbuyer\u201d is going to try to maximize his \u201cROI\u201d). The whole thing is fucked, and to perceive of this lifestyle in a vacuum as separate from our politics is fallacious at best and harmful at worst.\n\nIf we want to discuss separating value from worth in sugaring, we need to also be having these conversations as they relate to capitalism as a whole. We are nothing more than a source of labour to employers, why should we be more than human capital to SDs? It\u2019s very tricky.",

So this was never some big secret like you invented the wheel lol.\n\nSecondly not every woman is looking for such an allowance even if a student. Some look for just an SD, they want a few platonic dates and after all this to start with a monthly allowance. Many guys here just look to have sex with as many women as possible giving the minimum they can get away with so if one wants to avoid that they go the platonic rut and after that either a monthly or bi weekly allowance. This will deter guys who just throw 300 PPM or such to have fun for a night and after that they are looking for the next SB. Not everyone feels ok being intimate for a low amount and face the risk of never seeing that guy again. So if not in a desperate situation not everyone is ok with your scenario. So why pretend it's so magnific what you offer. You never meet a SB more than a month from all you write here. So it's not like you make a big difference in their life with your offer. You lack consistency so for many not worth it to see a guy one or two, three times then poof, to start all over again and have the thought in your head that you were intimate for an amount you get working one week part time with a guy you wouldn't vanilla date.",

When a SB is looking for financial help which most of them are,the above guys are a distraction ,time wasters ,and cost time and money.  Perhaps more important than amount of allowance is longevity of a negotiated SR. To wit, a 22 yr old is \"courted\"for 2 weeks by a POT( #1). She agrees to a PPM allowance of $XYZ. The \"SD\" takes her out ,pays her allowance(or not) and ghosts. Even if the $$ is a decent PPM,she is out 2-3 weeks of effort and has to start over. Then take Pot #2,who offers $ABC which is 1/2 #1 PPM. But he is a good SD,sees her weekly in addition to treating her to dinner and other events,and is going on 8 months. Which is better and more desired by the SB? That is an individual decision since some SBs draw the allowance line. But in the end the longer relationship is the more lucrative and enjoyable. So I suggest that SBs screen for LOS(length of service) rather than just the $$. I realize that it is easier said than done ,but focus an a guy who will stick rather than a flashier man who is likely a player bouncing from girl to girl to get that ego fix.",

I am however happy that your Whale keeps you in designer bags and other trinkets. (See what I did there?) \n\nAnd for the record - that is just about the amount of money it cost me to save the most lovable Goldie pet of a POT. I learned of what she and her doggo was going through and immediately took her and her dog to the Vet two hours after our first M&G. \n\nSo how about you save your \"captain save a ho\" bullshit? :-)",

Ive seen so many posts where a new SB is completely happy and excited to have a successful SR with someone she genuinely likes, and then all the bitter jaded posters will tell her she needs to dump his ass or ask for more and try to replace someone that she actually likes. What these aging pros don't realize is most women that sugar aren't as calculated and cold when it comes to these decisions. Many would much rather have someone consistent, that they have an attraction and connection to, that also treats them good while getting a lower amount, then having to force or fake it to get more with someone else that gives more.",

I have had them for a long time and they are very happy.  I have recently taken my favorite on an expensive trip to Europe.\n\nSome women don't care who they have an arrangement with as long as they get a lot of $$.  Those arrangements involve short quick dates and do not last very long.  I do not like women who have such low standards for a man.  I prefer women who want a long term arrangement with a attractive man that they admire and care about. If they want more than 200 at a time, we part ways and they keep looking for a guy who is desperate and who has trouble meeting women.",

I have had 2 arrangements where everything was covered but as nice as it was I\u2019ve always enjoyed working and if you look at my post history I wrote how sugaring allowed me to advance my career by being able to take the entry level jobs I needed to build my resume while raising young children. \n\nThat said bc it is not my sole source of income no one can take credit for my achievements, I don\u2019t take lower allowances bc I don\u2019t HAVE to, it actually safe guards me from low allowances bc predatory men know I\u2019m not desperate or would stay bc I have to, and in such a competitive city like Manhattan it\u2019s so risky to put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nAlso, this is why this post was so infuriating not bc of the point that money matters to some bc OF COURSE money matters. But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

For what purpose do they *need* to if sugaring was just an auxiliary income? I didn't mean to imply that you were lazy or snobby. That being said, I can honestly say that I have done fine with SBs here in NYC at 300-400 and that asking me for more than 400 has only happened once. Whether they have or have not had other SDs as well is not even any of my business really. Just as it is not theirs to know if I have other SBs (unless we were to specifically decide on exclusivity, which I haven't asked for).",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

There are many people in NYC who would happily accept an extra $300 a week and it would have a dramatic effect because it is so expensive and would help relieve some of the financial burden for them.\n\n His post was not bragging about how great he was for doing anything. It stated a simple fact that for some one working a part time retail job making $350 weekly that almost doubling their  cash will have an impact. \n\nYour comments are of no value and seem to be made just for the sole purpose of being confrontational. Which seem to be a reoccurring theme for you. 23% of the comments are from one person, you,  harping about the same nonsense. Plus multiple reports coming in because you don't know how to express your thoughts and opinions without personal attacks and name calling. Like I said  Drop it and move it along.

I've known more than a couple of times where $300 made a difference in MY life between choosing a path that probably would have ended in my death. I am however happy that your Whale keeps you in designer bags and other trinkets. (See what I did there?) \n\nAnd for the record - that is just about the amount of money it cost me to save the most lovable Goldie pet of a POT. I learned of what she and her doggo was going through and immediately took her and her dog to the Vet two hours after our first M&G. \n\nSo how about you save your \"captain save a ho\" bullshit? :-)",

Ive seen so many posts where a new SB is completely happy and excited to have a successful SR with someone she genuinely likes, and then all the bitter jaded posters will tell her she needs to dump his ass or ask for more and try to replace someone that she actually likes. What these aging pros don't realize is most women that sugar aren't as calculated and cold when it comes to these decisions. Many would much rather have someone consistent, that they have an attraction and connection to, that also treats them good while getting a lower amount, then having to force or fake it to get more with someone else that gives more.",

But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

Whether they have or have not had other SDs as well is not even any of my business really.

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

I am however happy that your Whale keeps you in designer bags and other trinkets.

But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules.

Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

I've known more than a couple of times where $300 made a difference in MY life between choosing a path that probably would have ended in my death. I am however happy that your Whale keeps you in designer bags and other trinkets. (See what I did there?) \n\nAnd for the record - that is just about the amount of money it cost me to save the most lovable Goldie pet of a POT. I learned of what she and her doggo was going through and immediately took her and her dog to the Vet two hours after our first M&G. \n\nSo how about you save your \"captain save a ho\" bullshit? :-)",

But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

For what purpose do they *need* to if sugaring was just an auxiliary income? I didn't mean to imply that you were lazy or snobby. That being said, I can honestly say that I have done fine with SBs here in NYC at 300-400 and that asking me for more than 400 has only happened once. Whether they have or have not had other SDs as well is not even any of my business really. Just as it is not theirs to know if I have other SBs (unless we were to specifically decide on exclusivity, which I haven't asked for).",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

It stated a simple fact that for some one working a part time retail job making $350 weekly that almost doubling their  cash will have an impact. \n\nYour comments are of no value and seem to be made just for the sole purpose of being confrontational. Which seem to be a reoccurring theme for you. 23% of the comments are from one person, you,  harping about the same nonsense.

But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

Whether they have or have not had other SDs as well is not even any of my business really. Just as it is not theirs to know if I have other SBs (unless we were to specifically decide on exclusivity, which I haven't asked for).",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

For you 300-400 isn't enough because you'd rather earn it another way in that case (or hold out for a wealthier SD). OK, fine.

Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

I have had 2 arrangements where everything was covered but as nice as it was I\u2019ve always enjoyed working and if you look at my post history I wrote how sugaring allowed me to advance my career by being able to take the entry level jobs I needed to build my resume while raising young children. \n\nThat said bc it is not my sole source of income no one can take credit for my achievements, I don\u2019t take lower allowances bc I don\u2019t HAVE to, it actually safe guards me from low allowances bc predatory men know I\u2019m not desperate or would stay bc I have to, and in such a competitive city like Manhattan it\u2019s so risky to put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nAlso, this is why this post was so infuriating not bc of the point that money matters to some bc OF COURSE money matters. But bc of the validity of a 22 yr old in NYC only working 4 days a week and ONLY making 350!!! I know the minimum wage here, I know the cost of living and I know the job market. People here do not work that little and an attractive girl in this city has soooo many ways non sex work to make GOOD money. My nanny when my kids were little made 600 a week and worked a second job, my other job I was dogs in the mornings (it\u2019s fun and I walk dogs) I make 700 a week doing that, and an attractive 22 yr old can work just about any restaurant no problem and make 3 times that!!!! \n\nThis maybe a true commentary for a small town yes I get it...I even said in a post in my hometown 300 is easily half your rent!!! This post makes no sense for NYC and I whole heartedly believe it\u2019s some lame attempt to use NUMBERS to convince a group of us on the east and west coast that lower allowances are the norm.\n\nDoes this make sense or anyone else wanna tell me I\u2019m snobby, don\u2019t work, or am just bragging on my allowances. \n\nI get what I get mostly bc men who see a person working hard they WANT to help I am so far from lazy.",

For what purpose do they *need* to if sugaring was just an auxiliary income? I didn't mean to imply that you were lazy or snobby. That being said, I can honestly say that I have done fine with SBs here in NYC at 300-400 and that asking me for more than 400 has only happened once. Whether they have or have not had other SDs as well is not even any of my business really. Just as it is not theirs to know if I have other SBs (unless we were to specifically decide on exclusivity, which I haven't asked for).",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

There are many people in NYC who would happily accept an extra $300 a week and it would have a dramatic effect because it is so expensive and would help relieve some of the financial burden for them.\n\n His post was not bragging about how great he was for doing anything. It stated a simple fact that for some one working a part time retail job making $350 weekly that almost doubling their  cash will have an impact. \n\nYour comments are of no value and seem to be made just for the sole purpose of being confrontational. Which seem to be a reoccurring theme for you. 23% of the comments are from one person, you,  harping about the same nonsense. Plus multiple reports coming in because you don't know how to express your thoughts and opinions without personal attacks and name calling. Like I said  Drop it and move it along. It's not up for debate.",

The last club I worked at me and the only three American girls are blonde all said we\u2019re just sit in a corner until we were told to go hang out with the whales. And before anyone says her know there was not Sex involved if anything the guys just wanted to do a lot of Coke.",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

People can look down on it all ya want but grinding on some laps has been more enjoyable than most of my sugaring M&G\u2019s \n\nSo some can call us older or jaded but facts are 300 isn\u2019t going to be most women in Manhattans sole SD number or probably most major very expensive cities. \n\nAlso men here want you to have a very flexible schedule, host days, be able to be flexible in your plans bc of their busy schedules. To have that kind of availability it is difficult to be working multiple jobs as most people do in NYC.\n\nThere is survival and there is improvement.",

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

Which seem to be a reoccurring theme for you. 23% of the comments are from one person, you,  harping about the same nonsense. Plus multiple reports coming in because you don't know how to express your thoughts and opinions without personal attacks and name calling. Like I said  Drop it and move it along.

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

I have talked with quite a number of POTs but ultimately decide to meet only a few of them. Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

For you 300-400 isn't enough because you'd rather earn it another way in that case (or hold out for a wealthier SD). OK, fine.

Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

Of those few that I chose to meet, all have proceeded into an SR.\n\nI prefer to get to know them for a while online/over text first to be sure we'll be compatible. That already shakes off a decent number of people who want to move more quickly. But, I feel like I'm a bit of a nerd/goofball (perhaps not evident in this thread, lol) which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So I like to avoid meeting people I don't think will have much common ground with me. My type physically isn't a huge bar to hit, I think, but I am quite picky when it comes to personality. (Not trying to win any brownie points here, I just place a big emphasis on being comfortable with an SB)\n\nAdmittedly, this screening increases the time between SBs for me by a decent amount, but it's worth it. I haven't had an awkward first meet that I wanted to run out of or been scammed yet. That's worth the cost of going into a (gasp) second month of SA premium.\n\nAnyway, I honestly have no idea where I was going with this so...  to each their own or something.",

Which is indicative of the lower end not a lot of staying power. \n\nYou are assuming these girls are 100% ok with it bc they accept it but if it\u2019s off SA there is a weird low ball climate going on over there. Which is contributing to flakiness in my opinion....so yes 400 is setting you apart I will agree but even with success at the lower end upping isn\u2019t the worst idea when someone is truly worth keeping around or just really does it for you!",
