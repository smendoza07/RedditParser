    "body": "If you receive a suspicious message from someone you've never met offering to send you large sums of money please proceed with caution.\n\nThe message might've been sent by an individual attempting advance-fee fraud, also called the \u201c419 scam.\u201d\n\n**What to look out for**\n\nIn combination, the following characteristics may indicate that you're dealing with a scammer:\n\n**Does he/she:**\n\n* Use odd phrases, or strange formatting in the conversation?\n* Offer to send you more money than you are asking for? This is known as an overpayment scam and is described under How the Scam Appears below.\n* Say they are a traveling businessperson, an oceanographer, out of the country, want to start providing for you before you meet or away at sea?\n* Insist you reply via a personal email address, off of SA or whatever site they originally contacted you on? A SD/SM who immediately insists on communicating off of site may be questionable.\n* Seem to not have read or looked at your profile, based on their vague questions?\n* Insist on sending you a check, your bank login information, your credit card login information, or offers you their bank account information to pay off debt, etc.\n* Asks you to send some of the money to someone else. An employee, charity, etc before the money has cleared.\n* Asks you to purchase gift cards and give him/her the code on the back before the money has cleared.\n* Wants to put you on his/her payroll.\n\n**How the scam appears**\n\nThe scammer will attempt to convince you to accept a fake payment for more than the allowance amount you initially agreed to/was offered by him/her. If they are successful, the scammer will get the money/or gift card value. In nearly every case, the con artist will not be caught.\n\n**Here's an example of how the scam can play out:**\n\nYou get the attention of a 419 scammer. They offer you an allowance amount with no request to meet up, excuse why they can't now, or an online arrangement. They tell you an allowance amount that is too good to be true, $1,000 a week but then sends you $1,800. They want you to send the extra money to someone else via Western Union, Money Gram, etc, because they can't right now(even though they just sent some to you). Or they want you to purchase itune, amazon, google play gift cards and send them the number on the back.\n\nYou deposit the $1,800 into your bank and then spend $800 doing the favors for the scammer. Or pay off your credit card with the info they gave you and used the card to make gift card purchases for the scammer. The scammer counts on you doing this before the check officially clears your bank account. This window between deposit and processing is known as \u201cfloat time\u201d and can last seven days, ten days, or even longer if the payment is international. During this time the money can be transferred, but it has not been verified by your bank as real.\n\nOnce the payment is processed, your bank will determine that it is fake. They will take the entire $1,800 back from you. Since you will have already spent the $800 for the scammer, you must repay the bank $800 of your own money. If you have spent any of the $1,000 you thought you earned, you will also need to replace that. In the case of the credit card you will owe the full balance you thought was payed off plus any purchases you made on behalf of the scammer.\n\n**Why does this scam work?**\n\nThese scammers typically create multiple accounts on dating and social media sites and send the same message to many different people with little or no personalization. The scammer's messages are meant to trigger greed and over ride common sense.\n\nThe scammer\u2019s payment is a forgery. It is not real! Your bank may allow you to deposit it, or your credit card might say payment received but the payment will not clear. Your bank will hold you responsible for the entire amount.\n\nIn the case of a PayPal payment, the scammer will either send a fake PayPal confirmation email or pay with a fraudulent payment source. Whether you return the \u201coverpayment\u201d via PayPal or a wire transfer service such as Western Union or Money Gram, you will still be held responsible for all of the money involved.\n\nRemember: Money sent back to the scammer is money which is lost forever.\n\n**What you should do**\n\n* Do not respond to the messages. Don't engage these scammers for any reason. Responding will encourage the scammers and cause you to receive further scam messages, and give the scammer more opportunities to manipulate you.\n* Report the account messaging you if that is an option.\n* If you've already given out your personal login information contact your bank immediately and let them know you believe your account may be compromised. Follow their security protocols for securing your account.\n* If you've already sent money or gift cards, still contact your bank but you're pretty much screwed. You'll owe the money spent even if it was an empty account created especially for this purpose. And you may have your accounts shutdown for fraudulent activities or owe additional fees.\n* The scammer, sensing your reluctance, may start sending you messages threatening legal action if you don't send their money back.  This is one of many reasons you should just block all scammer messages, so you don't panic into doing something stupid.   You do not have their money, and you should not send them anything.\n\n**Other Signs of Scams**\n\nYou can be certain you're getting scammed if you see any of these things.  To be clear: if you experience any of these things, it's **always** a scam.\n\n* He asks you *anything* about your bank account -- the account number so that he can do a transfer, the bank, or the username/password.  No SD needs this information.\n* He wants you to open a bank account, [id.me](https://id.me) account, an account at a particular place he specifies, or any other type of account.  He may have specific sites he needs you to open the account at.\n* He gives you his bank account information  and wants you to transfer money out of it\n* He wants you to pick up a vanilla card or any sort of reloadable visa card or gift card, Steam Card, iTunes card, Google Play card, etc.\n* He wants to put you on the payroll or otherwise pay you through his business\n* He wants to send you a check or picture of a check to deposit\n* He wants to send you a payment but wants you to send back some of it in the form of a gift card or any other way, or to send some of the money on to a different account or person.  He will likely have some (poor) explanation as to why he needs you to send it on, rather than doing it himself.\n* He wants you to install \"blockchain\", will only deal in bitcoin, altcoins, or any other cryptocurrency.  He wants you to buy bitcoin (or any cybercurrency) on his behalf, for any reason.\n* He can only do mobile deposit (he'll have some story as to why -- venmo has given him trouble, he's gotten ripped off through paypal, he can't use any apps, etc)\n* He can only send allowance through some obscure mechanism -- bitcoin, blockchain, discovery account, etc. The mechanism itself will change, it's the fact that he's picked one this one mechanism that is not cash, that you need to look for\n* He wants your login info for any currency transfer app or mechanism\n* He has not met you yet, or gotten any value from the relationship at all, but he wants to transfer large sums to you or pay off your credit cards or loans\n* He gives you *his* credit card or bank account # and tells you to use them or transfer money out of them\n* He's looking for platonic, but wants to send large sums to you\n* He wants to use you as his personal assistant, he'll send money to you, and your job will be to pass that money on to others.  Or any variation of him wanting to put you on his payroll.\n* He claims he is going to have his assistant, accountant, financial advisor, CFO, lawyer, or any other third party, arrange the financials.\n* He'll start sending you a large allowance, but you need to send him a little money first to verify you are real and establish trust (any \"prove you are real\" \"prove you are serious\" obligation is a scam).  You have to pay some sort of \"commitment fee\" because he's been scammed before so he needs to know he can trust you.\n* You need to pay money, for any reason whatsoever, in order to collect your allowance.  Most common is that you need to pay some sort of paypal or venmo fee before the funds can be released.  He may show you a fake screenshot to \"prove\" this.\n* You need to send money or bitcoin on to someone or somewhere else, for any reason whatsoever.\n* He sends you pics of documents that would completely compromise him and his security (e.g., his DL, his Passport) in advance\n* He shows you screenshots of his bank accounts and/or transfers he's made to previous SBs.   He sends you a video of his former SBs saying that he's paid them.  He volunteers to let you talk to his previous SBs.  Any sort of validation of the fact that he's made transfers before is a scam, no legit SD would ever do this.\n* He pretends to try to use an app to send money, then shows you screenshots of how it failed, in order to manipulate you into using his transfer method of choice (usually credit or gift card, or pic of check)\n* He's going to pay you an allowance but allowance won't start until the middle or end of the month (he's going to collect his month of free sex and then ghost)\n* You try to discuss allowance and he shames you for being a prostitute, \"I thought you were different\", etc.  Gaslighting you and making you feel guilty, him pretending to be morally outraged, this is always the prelude to either a scam or him manipulating you to have sex without any support.\n* SD whose name/number you don't recognize, contacts you on text (they have your phone number), claims to have gotten it from another SD.\n* SD contacts you and then claims to be lining up an SB for his friend.\n* He is still a POT, and wants you to delete your profile, and is pushy about it if you push back.  No one who is still a POT cares whether you have an active profile or not; they don't want you to have a profile so it's tougher to report them.\n* You're a male SB and you've met an SM.  This is about 100% certain of a scam by itself, but if you've never met and they want to send you money, then 110% certain.\n* He sends you pictures of money\n* Any variation of a man contacting you trying to convince you to be SD to his girlfriend or some love interest of his\n* He wants to do a cashapp transfer but won't use your cashtag, he needs your cashapp card\n* She wants you to venmo money before the M&G (to pay for gas, or her nails, etc) or due to a sudden crisis (e.g., flat tire)\n* She wants you to send her money before you've met, and/or as a condition of meeting, to \"prove you're serious\"\n* She has a crisis (family emergency, a bill to pay) and needs you to send her money, before you've ever met.  This will usually occur just before the M&G.\n* She tells you she won't accept cash and requires a gift card instead.  She's has no intention of meeting -- she'll have you send a pic of the gift card in advance to prove you bought it, then use the numbers to make purchases, without ever seeing you.\n\n**Could be a scam**\n\nMaybe not 100%, but the vast majority of the time, these are scams.\n\n* You've just joined a discord, kik, or other private sugar group where the group owner/moderator sets you up with another group member to be your SD.  Spoiler alert: the mod who is acting as a matchmaker, and the SD he's set you up with, are the same person.  I have never heard of this type of situation where it hasn't ended badly for the SB, but leaving this in \"could be a scam\" for now.\n* It's the very beginning of an arrangement and he wants to use venmo, cashapp, or paypal instead of cash, to send you allowance (this is not a red flag if sending a smaller symbolic gift). Despite popular belief, all three of those are reversible, although not always easily. Cash is best at the beginning.\n* SD sends you a message, and in his very first message, he says he wants you to contact him by text, whatsapp, kik, etc.  New SD non-premium accounts get 10 free messages they're allowed to send, but they cannot read any responses unless they pay the $100 for a premium account.  Since many scammers (and other undesirables) do not want to pay for a premium account, they need you to respond off the site.   Do not even consider replying off the site unless you first confirm the SD contacting you has a premium account.  If you're not sure, send them a message back through SA.  If he can read it and respond, he's premium.\n* Man claiming to be an SD randomly approaches you on Instagram (nearly all instagram stories end up being scams). SD emphasizes he wants some combination of loyalty, trust, honesty: very common reverse psychology ploy, before the scam starts, and a common element of the scammer script.  98% of the time it's a scammer.\n* She requires you give her the full allowance or PPM at the beginning of the date (e.g., when she gets to the restaurant) rather than when you get to the room\n* Poor grammar and odd phrasing is common among scammers.  Some mistakes very commonly seen include \"Am interested in being your SD\" (Leaving out \"I\"), and \"will like to give you allowance\" (instead of \"would\").  Other commonly seen phrases: \"Hello I am William by name\", \"I want to spoil you with my money\".  While there are legit non-native English speaking SDs out there, these particular phrases are tip-offs you're probably dealing with a scammer.\n\nThe rules change once you're in an established arrangement and have earned trust. The rules are slightly different in non-US countries also, where some forms of bank transfer are safer... but still, it makes little sense not to start with cash, which is safe.\n\n**A Word About POTs Contacting You On Reddit**\n\nPlease also read: [https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/la5mlk/caution\\_to\\_slf\\_sbs\\_on\\_reddit\\_scammers\\_posing\\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/la5mlk/caution_to_slf_sbs_on_reddit_scammers_posing_as/)\n\nAnywhere there are people gathering in numbers to talk sugar, there will be many, many scammers.   That doesn't just mean Seeking or Instagram, it also means reddit.  Many SBs are lured into a false sense of security when someone on reddit DMs them, claiming to be an slf member. The scammers take advantage of the fact that we naturally feel close to our fellow sub members.   **Many SBs have fallen victim to scams that start with a DM on reddit**.  And it's not just SBs,  multiple SDs also have bad stories, often resulting in blackmail attempts and other scams, when the SD lets his guard down and uses his real phone number, does a video chat, or something similar.  This applies as much to SDs.\n\nThree suggestions:\n\n1. Vet all reddit contacts as tightly as you would a POT on SA.  Do not give any up-front benefit of the doubt just because they're on reddit, or claim to have interacted with you on the sub.  For you SDs: one of the blackmail stories that happened here, the \"SB\" scammer first did a profile review (!) and appeared to use iMessage (!!) when texting... and still turned out to be a blackmailer.  The victim SD DMed the SB after her profile review because he was attracted, which we think was the strategy all along.  The \"SB\" behind that profile review turned out to be a blackmailer.\n2. Strongly consider not even accepting DMs from lurkers in the first place.  Through tracing some of the scam stories, we've found that nearly all these scams start with an unsolicited DM from someone who is not active on slf. They claim to be on slf, they may claim to have interacted with you there or are reaching out because of something you wrote.  But if you look at their post history, there is no post history on slf.   **The one simple, easy thing you can do to protect yourself is to decline all these DMs**.  Only accept DMs from names you recognize from the sub, or who at least have a post history on slf.\n3. The fact that he is so charming and nice, is not proof he's not a scammer.  \"He was so nice, he didn't act like a scammer, so I let my guard down\" is a common refrain from scammed SBs.  Being nice isn't proof of anything -- be sure to vet your POTs!\n\n**Credits**\n\nu/LaSirene23 wrote the top portion of this post, describing scams and the details around how they work.  u/Azurecole collected scam stories on SLF and elsewhere and subsequently wrote the bottom section on scam signs.

I have had SDs say the same thing, \"You tell SBs that X is always a scam, but I do X, and I'm not a scammer\".   And my reply is: okay, but 9999 times out of 10000, it will be a scam.  I'm not going to tell SBs that it's not a red flag just because 1 guy in the world does it and he's not a scammer.  You need to be aware of what scammers do, and not act like one.\n\nIt's the same reason that, when my buddy asked me to teach him how to be an SD, the first thing I had him read is milliondollarkitty's article on staying safe as an SB.  I wanted him to understand what behavior is a red flag to SBs, so he could avoid it.  It's not in anyone's interest for a legit SB or SD to act like a scammer; find some other way to do th ings, or risk being pegged as a scammer, IMO.",

The whole point is to screen each other... and if you're a match and things work out the SB is going to come out ahead financially and it would be well worth her time and effort. You have to realize that for most SDs >95% of effort searching leads nowhere too, most \"SBs\" on sites are fakes or scammers, and for me at least 2/3 of those I plan a M&G with never happens, even if you have a M&G expectations often don't line up, so as a SD I'd never gamble and put anything up front with such horrible odds.",

I said specifically, before the M&G.  In basically 100% of cases I've heard about, if a POT SB wants an SD to venmo her prior to the M&G, it's always a scam.  There's corner cases, for example it's long distance and he has to cover her plane flight.  But beyond that, the best advice is: all SDs would be better off not venmo'ing anything to any POT prior to the M&G, assume anyone asking is a scammer.  If she wants him to give her a gift at the M&G, not necessarily a scam (though not the norm).\n\nI wasn't sure if I addressed your objection -- am I misunderstanding?",

Obviously, sometimes it DOES work out just fine ,but there's always some element of risk, starting from the issue you're bringing up (how to book the flight without giving your info), to the subconscious pressure you'll put on yourself to put out since he paid for your flight and hotel.  Best left to experienced SBs IMO.\n\nFor the plane flight, one of you is going to have to take a risk.  Either he cashapps you the money in advance and trusts that you're going to book a flight with it rather than ghost, or you give him all your personal details and he books the flight.  It's difficult for me to understand why neither of you can find a partner closer, so as not to have to deal with this.",

They just fucked up their scam attempt on you. You didn\u2019t intend for any of this to even happen . Do NOT feel bad\u2014 they were trying to do a lot worse. All you wanted was to find a legit SD. This individual knew that they were never going to fulfill that role; they deliberately were shady and wasted your time... NO ONE LEGIT WOULD EVER DO THAT! You know that.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t feel bad. Scammers use guilt on top of false promises (that are often too good to be true) to manipulate you. Guilt is their #1 weapon and it seems to still be working on you. Sociopaths don\u2019t feel guilt but they know normal people experience it all the time and so they learn how to use that to their advantage. This person was able to sense that you were kind and giving them the benefit of the doubt, and just stomped all over that. I\u2019m happy they messed up. \n\nYou deserve MORE than the $5 iTunes giftcard for having this person lie to you and try over and over again to try and take your money, knowing you don\u2019t have much. Not to mention you still clearly feel somewhat bad about it, because you\u2019re a decent human being. So fuck them... you are not in the wrong here.",

I understand many SB\u2019s are in a vulnerable place already, which can be understandable, but there are certain cases where the SD really needs to take it into consideration and decide whether it\u2019s in that persons best interest. I got into it when I was 18, very very intimately inexperienced/ immature and stopped at 19. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and was abused along the way. Albeit I\u2019m 20 now and was/ am a sober college student so it was probably hard for people to tell I wasn\u2019t okay. But I would say as a rule of thumb generally avoid under 20\u2019s and ask about drugs, kids, etc. Kinda tell tale signs. Don\u2019t get into it with anyone mentally unstable/ addicted unless you want to help them in that way, (btw it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t it\u2019s not ur job.) Also be picky. Don\u2019t get into it w randoms unless that\u2019s what u want. Really evaluate what you want and what you are looking for, what could be the downsides, upsides, risks, etc. There are just a lot of these very unstable SB\u2019s which is why I really emphasize being picky. There is also an absolutely insane ratio of SDs/ SBs so waiting a little bit longer won\u2019t be a problem. You\u2019ll find one eventually. And also be as up front as possible. Good luck and stay safe:)\ud83d\udc4d\n\nemphasis on the age part. No matter how well- read, experienced, or \u201csmart\u201d someone may seem, if they are under 20-21 I can almost guarantee you it will end in a mess.

Once, it was even a girl who talked to me for so long and related with me on so many things, like our children, common interests or thoughts, etc. I thought I gained a new friend and she pulled this crypto scam out of nowhere acting like she wanted to help us grow together. I was like wtf, should've known no one really gets to know anyone anymore to gain a friend, they're usually just out trying to come up on someone else. It's so pathetic.",

Cause like you said in your experience, they're usually quick to respond, quick to the point...it usually don't take long to see what their intentions are at all, or sometimes they don't type English well.

Then I just entertained the conversation out of boredom. She had this whole backstory, but the fun started when she said she was 35. I was thinking, 35 and you're a sugar MAMA?! When she got into the bitcoin, forex stuff, I was really hoping I could scam a scammer, but alas, I was outsmarted by cash app. For future reference, I highly doubt there are any serious SDs following Seeking.

Then asks for PayPal link only to then say it's pending an I can't get to the shop to verify it. Even sends screen shot of this. And then when I say scam. He proceeds to say no of course not an senses another screen shot of messages with another girl he's messaged an she's cool with it. Then says look you can get a pre paid card it happens to one of my other girls an she went on duddle.com an got a card an I out the money on that. Then as I was not mining on it so I asked other ways to catch him out. And then said ok I'll cancel it. Even bad grammer as well how he's writing it. Then proceeds to say right I'll use gift card. Defo a scam hasn't met me yet, hasn't seen a photo. Wants to send a large sum of cash each week. And can't use pay Pal wants me to purchase the gift card an then he'll put money on. And all messaged seeming to be impatient I need to know you need to verify this now as I can't get to the shops. Etc etc etc. Thank fuck I done my research before going into this. And your site an others have helped massively with that. Girls please before delving into this world, do your research!!\n Is a MUST!!!!!",

We really don't have to go any further than this.\n* As mentioned in the scam thread, anyone sending you a large amount of money for practically nothing (feet pics, and \"just keep him out of boredom\" count as nothing) is a scammer.  100% of the  time.\n* As mentioned in the scam thread, anyone sending you his ID and SSN is a scammer.  100%, no exceptions.   With his ID and SSN, you can steal his identity and everything he has.  Only scammers send this information (it's fake, BTW, likely stolen).  It is critical that you have the adult level judgement to know that a wealthy successful man is not going send you all the information  you need to steal his identity; rather, he will be doing everything he can to protect and  hide that information.  Adult judgement wise, this should be raising huge red flags. Only for scammer victims does it \"prove he's serious\".\n\nYou have three separate things, clearly mentioned in the scam thread, that indicate 100% of the time, this is a scam.   Moreover, as explained in detail in that thread, even if your check clears to your account in a few days, it will be found to be fraudulent and reversed in the coming days or weeks.  You'll be liable for paying it back, plus any fees, plus sometimes the bank will drop your account.  If you're not sure, feel free to just sit on it -- I 100% guarantee you this will all come to pass!",

What you're describing is the same as what I'm listing below, right?  Is there some reason you don't see the match that it's always a scam?  Here it is right  from the article:\n\n* He wants to send you a check or picture of a check to deposit\n\n>Then like not ever send him money so I wouldn\u2019t lose money if it was fake and the money actually isn\u2019t deposited??\n\nYes you'll lose money.  This is **always a scam**.  Which means you're going to be fraudulently depositing a check into your account.  Once the fraud is found out, the money will be withdrawn and your bank will hold you accountable for any subsequent fees.\n\n>He sent me proof of someone else depositing it\n\nAgain, straight from the article in the **always a scam** section:\n\n* He shows you screenshots of his bank accounts and/or transfers he's made to previous SBs\n\nHe did not send you proof of anything.  You do know it's trivially easy to fake a screenshot, right?  You're not ready for the bowl if this is something confusing.  Is there some reason the article isn't clear on all of this?\n\n>don\u2019t want to get scammed or do anything illegal so I just want to know  if this is something smart to do or if I should just block him??\n\nYes you're getting scammed, yes it's illegal, yes you should block him just like the article says\n\n>He said the same thing about the not being able to venmo or anything because his last SB stole from him.\n\nAgain, this is listed in the **always a scam** section.  No reason to question it -- it matches what we described, block and move on.\n\nFor anyone reading this, if any **one** thing you're experiencing matches the always a scam section, you are being scammed, block and move on. No need to question it.  If you're getting two or three things that super clearly match what we've described, there should be no question.  This is a good example of how when you're really hopeful, sometimes your mind wants you not to believe it's a scam, even when there are clear, exact matches to our scam article.",

I have see  such absolutely crazy shit on there even I start to question the nature of reality. I won\u2019t go into details but \u2014-for example, there are guys deepfaking their looks into an analogous female version. If they get your number, they have techniques to try to extort you. In some cases, yes, SA serves as one part of larger prostitution rings. In other cases people on there may just be sadists or anarchists who want to you to reveal sexual secrets and then chastise you for being so dumb when you call them out. It may even be foreign intel on there. They even seem to have people acting some of these fake roles in RL, so when you FaceTime you sort of get the person. Run very very far away from this site, it is one the most evil and horrific online places I\u2019ve been.\n\nAlmost no woman on SA, of any level of reasonable desirability, is real. On my last escapade on SA, when I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I started calling out fakes, one after another, then quit. This was followed by a threatening text from someone who got my number. There are evil evil people at work there. You have been warned",

They'll have her create an account, talk her into putting a little something into it or doing a test purchase, and then either giving him the credentials or her private key.\n\nThere's some basici adult-level judgement going on here also.  No successful SD is going to insist on crypto -- and only crypto -- from the very beginning.  SDs know how to pull cash out of an ATM and are happy giving that if that's what his brand new SB wants (and if she has any sense, she'll ask for cash at first)",

If you do not have a thorough knowledge of how crypto works, it is easy to have you sign up for a Coinbase account (again, Coinbase itself is legit) and then have you do something that gets you sending crypto to him rather than vice versa.  Crypto is irreversible, that's why scammers love it, once they trick you, that money is gone.\n\nStick to getting cash in person.  No legit SD needs to use only crypto and will refuse to do cash for at least the first meeting.",

I chatted with the \u201cowner \u201ca bit (where he gained my trust) and he said that he was out of town for the next two weeks but would send me over everything that I needed to get done for him along with the W2 forms for my taxes and all that so everything seemed on the up and up. That was until he told me he was going to be sending me a check to pay for the things he needed done which I didn\u2019t think anything of at the time because as a personal assistant you\u2019re there to basically do whatever they ask you and then he told me that since he was out of town for two weeks and I was getting paid weekly I could take my pay for those two weeks out of that paycheck. This is when I started to get suspicious because we hadn\u2019t met in person and I\u2019m thinking why are you sending me this check when you don\u2019t even know me and I could just pay myself and then quit after the first day but indeed is a reputable site as far as I had seen so I said OK and to my surprise a couple days later I got a check in the mail for $27,000 right before Christmas and as a single mom I thought wow I could really use this (My pay portion from the Check not the whole amount obviously) And it was a check from a business not a personal check well I looked into the business that was printed on the check along with the signature and the business that was on the check did not match up with the business he supposedly owned and that I was supposedly working for and the signature on the check was not his name. Long story short he was trying to get me to deposit a fraudulent check and send him the money because that would keep his hands clean of any illegal activity but his pockets full while keeping my hands dirty and having the potential to be put in federal prison. I took the check to my local police station along with print outs of our conversations. Unfortunately it\u2019s very hard to track these people so I\u2019m not sure if he ever got caught but it\u2019s crazy to think of how many people fall for scams like this and then end up either in crazy debt because they owe the bank back that money or worst case they end up in federal prison. I notified indeed as well But scammers are everywhere and as soon as one scam becomes overly used and gets exposed they come out with a new one so everybody please be careful",

Scammer claims to have tried to send you CashApp but hit some limit at his bank, for which he needs a $30 registration fee to clear.  He will show you a screenshot showing the failed cashapp transaction and message about the registration fee (as discussed, all screenshots are fraudulent, so it's fake).  He will tell  you that you need to send the $30 registration fee, so that you can get your $2500 allowance.  You send $30 fee, he ghosts.\n2. He sends CashApp for more than he said he would.  Asks you to send the extra on to someone else, possibly in the form of a gift card.  You're happy to do that, since you know CashApp can't be reversed, so you send a $100 gift card to his associate.  Then the CashApp he sent is found to be fraudulent and reversed (yes, cashapp can be reversed in the case of fraud); so you're out the $100 gift card.",

Anyone saying you need to do this is a scammer, no exceptions!\n\nCashapp does charge small fees for certain actions -- e.g., a 1.5% fee for instant transfer from YOUR cashapp account to your bank account.

Not a single one, not ever. This makes sense to me -- if there are SMs who are interested in young men, she has her pick of the litter and can find them in person.\n* There are occasionally -- rarely -- stories of male SBs who met their SMs freestyling or other in-person means.  We never get enough info to **really** convince me, but it seems vaguely believable.\n\nThere are definitely SMs out there for female SBs.  That's not in question, we have a number of them participating in slf.",

Why are you still staying and engaged and thinking you can game the system?  It doesn't matter if your bank account is old or new, it's the exact same scam, and has nothing to do with getting your information.  Do not create a new bank account, it's still a scam.  Please believe the scam thread when we say you are dealing with a scammer and you should block instead of thinking you can outsmart a scammer who does this professionally",

For those who fall for this, well of course to put you on their payroll, they'll need your name, address, social security number, bank and account # (for direct deposit of course), and now they have everything they need to steal your identity.\n\nI have heard of SDs and SBs in long term sugar relationships where he hired her into his company, but long term relationships aren't what we're talking about here.",

The amount was $3,500 anyways I canceled the payment while it was still pending.

Found multiple Facebook accounts under the name they gave me lol. They were texting Me via an email. And when I asked to FaceTime they stopped responding.

This is a place where you need to have adult level judgement -- no, someone isn't having their clients send you money.  Nor does she need help with buying bitcoin -- bitcoin is trivially easy to buy anonymously, ONLY SCAMMERS say this.  Again, adult judgement: someone wealthy enough to be an SM, would not require help buying bitcoin.  And the kicker, she's in Peru lol.\n\nOkay, seriously, this is pretty bad in how obvious it is.

If XYZ is a scam 999 out of 1000 times, it should be listed as \"always a scam\".  A naive SB who is out of her depth, should not be coached to play 1-out-of-1000 odds.  And \"pay through your business\" is probably more like 1 out of 10,000 or worse.  I don't think we do any SB any favors, basically telling her it \"could be\" a scam -- \"could be\" doesn't nearly do justice to it.\n2. All of these are for initial financial support, with essentially someone untrusted.  Many of these things are perfectly safe with someone you trust.  Crypto, for example, is a perfectly fine way to go when it's a trusted SD; too easy for an SB to get scammed if it's someone untrusted and unknown.  Similarly, if an SB's trusted SD wants to do a payroll type deal, well she knows him well enough.  But this is aimed at untrusted POTs.    Which raises the question -- did you start your very first PPM or allowance as a business payroll type check?  Or was this down the line, after you'd been in an SR for a while and she trusted you?  If the latter, then this advice doesn't apply -- are we're back to 1000/1000 times it's a scam, when it's merely a POT\n\nMake sense?",

Here is the exact quote from the scam thread, so you know what to look for in the future. I am going to guess, based on your description, that this applies also:\n\n>He has not met you yet, or gotten any value from the relationship at all, but he wants to transfer large sums to you or pay off your credit cards or loans\n\nThese are clear matches, right?\n\nAs far as how the scam works, the bank transfer you make is going to eventually get reversed.  It will be reversed by the scammer possibly, or possibly because it's not even the scammer's bank account so you are fraudulently accessing it and transferring money out of it to yourself. In any case, it will get reversed.  You will be responsible for paying it all back, plus the fees and penalties associated with the fraudulent transfer; in some cases, your bank will drop you.\n\nAs far as the scam itself, when you transfer the money, the scammer will ask for something from you.  Maybe they'll tell you \"please help me out, transfer an extra $300, and then send it on to my business associate\".  That transfer you do to his \"business associate\" (the scammer themselves) can't be reversed, so you're out the $300.  Or maybe once you do the transfer, he'll ask you for nudie pics or whatever.\n\nI'm going to sound snarkier than I mean to, but it's really important you understand this: it's critical you use adult judgement in the bowl.   Do you really believe a wealthy successful person is going to give a stranger on the internet, access to their bank account, and just let them transfer money out of it???  As an adult, it's important you know that real adults don't do this.  This is all putting aside that online SMs don't exist.  Real SDs (and the very very few SMs out there) will give you cash when you see them in person.  If you're going to continue doing online interactions, you'll want learn how online content sellers and online sexworkers protect themselves.  They are not going into people's bank accounts, accepting checks, allowing people to directly transfer money to their credit cards or bank accounts, etc. -- these are **always** scams.  Good luck!",

Text me, Snapchat me, Instagram me. (Etc)\n\nThere's very little info on their profiles. Who knows if it's even a real picture. They mention nothing about your profile. They live nowhere near you or don't regularly visit your town. And they don't want to communicate on the site. If you do contact them... they will ask for your bank info. Say they mean no harm. They just want to help. It's all a scam, Ladies. I'm so over this stupid game. I'm smart enough not to fall for it. But it's frustrating how big of a problem it is on that site.

            "body": "I think I also almost got scammed.\nSo here is my story: I was scrolling on a dating website and I got matched with a woman named Mya(38). She messaged me and asked me for her phone number so that we don\u2019t have to use the app. I gave it to her because I thought why not. \nSoon after that we casually wrote and then she asked me if I want to be her sugar baby. I had no experience in this field, so I declined first. After that she said it was okay we could just casually text with each other and I should delete the dating app (later I realised why). Some hours later she asked me again and promised me a weekly allowance (3000$) and I don\u2019t have to send her nudes and we don\u2019t have to meet. She claimed that since her husband died she was very lonely and wanted to have someone to talk to. I thought why not, so I agreed. Later this day she told me she wants proof for my sincerity cause her last SB scammed her (lied about her dad\u2019s health and hospital bill). She first wanted that I pay her 125$ per Paypal and she assured me that I will get it back right away with the 3000$ (3125$). I didn\u2019t hear about this kind of scams before but I was sceptical (I question most things). After a long chat with her I thought, if she was a scammer she would as for more than 125$, so I opened my PayPal account and typed in the email address she gave me and the amount. Meanwhile she always reminded me to send it as Family and Friend. But instead I sent it as the other option. It failed. I told her and she asked me to try again what I did (this time with Friends&Family). It failed again (maybe Paypal realised it was a scam). She always gave me a new address to try it and I asked her why she has so many accounts. She told me it was for her business. Every time it failed and I noticed that she was getting impatient. Now she decided on another method to test my sincerity. With an Amazon gift card (50$). It was a small amount so I guessed she wouldn\u2019t scam me for such a little amount. I bought it and sent her the code. Now she wanted to have another one with 75$ (125$ in total). After a long chat and discussion why she wanted to have another one I bought it and sent her the code. She was delighted and told me she trusted me now and will speak to her accountant to give me my first weekly allowance. The woman gave me her contact and I wrote her. As she told me that she will sent it to me now per Paypal (with a screenshot proof) I was really excited. Then the accountant showed me another screenshot and there was written that a 50$ fee was needed to send it. I was really anxious cause I felt I was getting scammed but I couldn\u2019t believe it so I went along and sent it. 24 hours later the payment from me went through and she told me she could sent it now. After a few minutes later she told me I had to boost the payment with another 70$. But that was enough for me. I told them I wouldn\u2019t send them the money and that she has to figure out another way to give it to me, but the accountant always told me \u201cthere is no other way. Ma\u2019am you have to trust me. Don\u2019t panic It is for your own safety\u201d. I accused them to be a scammer and that I want to call her and see a certificate or proof. When I called her I heard nothing and it was really creepy. Later she sent a voice message and it sounded really fake. I went to Amazon and blocked the payments and reported it. Same with the 50$ I sent on Paypal. I downloaded the dating app and looked at her profile and there was written that she was suspended cause of suspected scam. Now I know why she wanted me to delete the app.\nSo all in all I was very naive and lucky to get my money back.",

They said once I bought the gift cards with the credit cards they\u2019d pay them back off. I really took exception when they started asking for my drivers license, social security number, and the. Wanted me to start an I\u2019d.me account. I have blocked this person multiple times, they are still finding ways to contact me. They are threatening to contact the fbi if I don\u2019t send their money back for the credit card payments, (which seems to have cleared) but one of my credit cards did get restricted/locked when I was harassed so badly that I did try to buy gift cards. I still haven\u2019t called them back to unlock it, I\u2019m very embarrassed over the whole thing. I submitted the main email they were using to iMessage me to 3ic as a scam. I changed all my passwords. Can they actually come after me?\n\n3rd I sent $185 dollars worth of bitcoin as security deposit, and they claimed it wasn\u2019t enough. I told them I was over keep the money. If they wanted a friend great otherwise bounce, that I was never actually in it for financial gain anyways, just wanted someone I could connect with. \n\nHopefully the one I\u2019m talking to now is legit, SD seems to be, I really like him, only one that hasn\u2019t harassed me about money. Asks me about my day, feels like we\u2019re building a solid friendship to start. \n\nSo in other words wish I would have read this thread beforehand!",

Rookie approach and she had no reason to doubt me but it happened.  \n\n80% of this post can be summarized by saying \"If any POT / SD asks you for money or financial information, no matter how simple or complicated the situation they're describing may be, you can assume he's a scammer\".  I don't understand how any SB would ever even consider sending an unknown SD money in any situation.  That's the opposite of the entire purpose of the site so why would anyone do that?\n\nThere are a lot of SB scams missing from here, which are actually criminal fraud and very serious, such as: -\n\n\\-SB threatens to contact your wife, employer, family etc. unless you pay them which is extortion / blackmail. \n\n\\-SB fakes a pregnancy using photoshopped ultrasounds demanding money while she decides what she's going to do.\n\nThose 2 are really bad ones that I know criminal SB's have done to people which goes far beyond a scam.  SA has quite a few career criminal SB's on there that make a living off of extorting men like that.  I can't say that for SD's though because I've not heard of any man trying to continually con / extort money out of a SB which is just blatantly committing a criminal act.  Everyone be careful out there",

I don't understand how any SB would ever even consider sending an unknown SD money in any situation.  \n\nYou know that, and I know that, and nevertheless this scam is being done incredibly often.  And, I've had to get more and more specific -- e.g., I originally had examples like \"don't buy them a visa or steam card\" , and I'd hear from an SB that she got scammed even though she'd read the scam thread, because the scammer asked for an app store card, not visa or steam.  So I had to add more examples and then \"or any other card whatsoever\".  \n\nYour example of sending $ for pics is one of those that sometimes works out, but far more often won't.  I think engaging in content selling/buying with a POT is a terrible practice that leads to disappointment most of the time regardless, but that's a separate topic.   And yes, agree, I haven't done a full list of how SDs get scammed, just because it's SBs who seem to get scammed more often",

I have never offered $ for pics there are billions of free ones available on this brand new thing called the internet lol.\n\nI can't speak to whether SD's or SB's get scammed more, but I can say that based on everything I'm reading and have heard a SB should see it coming because if a man EVER asks for money in any way from you, unless it's like a $5 to tip a valet after dinner bc he doesn't have change, then they are scamming you.  Just don't ever do it.\n\nI can also say that I have had more than one SB criminal scamming situations that turned really ugly and a lot of things came to light once the authorities got involved.  I mentioned those items above (extortion, blackmail, faking pregnancies to extort men etc.) because those aren't uncommon occurrences.  The connecting thread that the authorities figured out, which I already knew even though some didn't involve me, was that these specific crimes / scams were being committed by women related back to SA (i.e SB;s).

I venmoed the money because the request was so specific, kind of made sense and was such a small amount.  She blocked me everywhere and was a no-show.   \n\n\nSo I would only suggest you don't make a pre-meeting payment a REQUIRMENT to come to a M&G. You're only shooting yourself in the foot and are limiting experienced SDs as pots.",

I have had SDs say the same thing, \"You tell SBs that X is always a scam, but I do X, and I'm not a scammer\".   And my reply is: okay, but 9999 times out of 10000, it will be a scam.  I'm not going to tell SBs that it's not a red flag just because 1 guy in the world does it and he's not a scammer.  You need to be aware of what scammers do, and not act like one.\n\nIt's the same reason that, when my buddy asked me to teach him how to be an SD, the first thing I had him read is milliondollarkitty's article on staying safe as an SB.  I wanted him to understand what behavior is a red flag to SBs, so he could avoid it.  It's not in anyone's interest for a legit SB or SD to act like a scammer; find some other way to do th ings, or risk being pegged as a scammer, IMO.",

The whole point is to screen each other... and if you're a match and things work out the SB is going to come out ahead financially and it would be well worth her time and effort. You have to realize that for most SDs >95% of effort searching leads nowhere too, most \"SBs\" on sites are fakes or scammers, and for me at least 2/3 of those I plan a M&G with never happens, even if you have a M&G expectations often don't line up, so as a SD I'd never gamble and put anything up front with such horrible odds.",

I said specifically, before the M&G.  In basically 100% of cases I've heard about, if a POT SB wants an SD to venmo her prior to the M&G, it's always a scam.  There's corner cases, for example it's long distance and he has to cover her plane flight.  But beyond that, the best advice is: all SDs would be better off not venmo'ing anything to any POT prior to the M&G, assume anyone asking is a scammer.  If she wants him to give her a gift at the M&G, not necessarily a scam (though not the norm).\n\nI wasn't sure if I addressed your objection -- am I misunderstanding?",

Obviously, sometimes it DOES work out just fine ,but there's always some element of risk, starting from the issue you're bringing up (how to book the flight without giving your info), to the subconscious pressure you'll put on yourself to put out since he paid for your flight and hotel.  Best left to experienced SBs IMO.\n\nFor the plane flight, one of you is going to have to take a risk.  Either he cashapps you the money in advance and trusts that you're going to book a flight with it rather than ghost, or you give him all your personal details and he books the flight.  It's difficult for me to understand why neither of you can find a partner closer, so as not to have to deal with this.",

I no longer have a relationship like that anymore (I\u2019m married with a family now), but somehow I stumbled on to this subreddit and it\u2019s interesting reading some of these threads and comments.\n\nIn this case, It\u2019s 100% ok that you \u201cscammed the scammer.\u201d And really, you didn\u2019t even scam them. They just fucked up their scam attempt on you. You didn\u2019t intend for any of this to even happen . Do NOT feel bad\u2014 they were trying to do a lot worse. All you wanted was to find a legit SD. This individual knew that they were never going to fulfill that role; they deliberately were shady and wasted your time... NO ONE LEGIT WOULD EVER DO THAT! You know that.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t feel bad. Scammers use guilt on top of false promises (that are often too good to be true) to manipulate you. Guilt is their #1 weapon and it seems to still be working on you. Sociopaths don\u2019t feel guilt but they know normal people experience it all the time and so they learn how to use that to their advantage. This person was able to sense that you were kind and giving them the benefit of the doubt, and just stomped all over that. I\u2019m happy they messed up. \n\nYou deserve MORE than the $5 iTunes giftcard for having this person lie to you and try over and over again to try and take your money, knowing you don\u2019t have much. Not to mention you still clearly feel somewhat bad about it, because you\u2019re a decent human being. So fuck them... you are not in the wrong here.",

I understand many SB\u2019s are in a vulnerable place already, which can be understandable, but there are certain cases where the SD really needs to take it into consideration and decide whether it\u2019s in that persons best interest. I got into it when I was 18, very very intimately inexperienced/ immature and stopped at 19. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and was abused along the way. Albeit I\u2019m 20 now and was/ am a sober college student so it was probably hard for people to tell I wasn\u2019t okay. But I would say as a rule of thumb generally avoid under 20\u2019s and ask about drugs, kids, etc. Kinda tell tale signs. Don\u2019t get into it with anyone mentally unstable/ addicted unless you want to help them in that way, (btw it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t it\u2019s not ur job.) Also be picky. Don\u2019t get into it w randoms unless that\u2019s what u want. Really evaluate what you want and what you are looking for, what could be the downsides, upsides, risks, etc. There are just a lot of these very unstable SB\u2019s which is why I really emphasize being picky. There is also an absolutely insane ratio of SDs/ SBs so waiting a little bit longer won\u2019t be a problem. You\u2019ll find one eventually. And also be as up front as possible. Good luck and stay safe:)\ud83d\udc4d\n\nemphasis on the age part. No matter how well- read, experienced, or \u201csmart\u201d someone may seem, if they are under 20-21 I can almost guarantee you it will end in a mess.

We really don't have to go any further than this.\n* As mentioned in the scam thread, anyone sending you a large amount of money for practically nothing (feet pics, and \"just keep him out of boredom\" count as nothing) is a scammer.  100% of the  time.\n* As mentioned in the scam thread, anyone sending you his ID and SSN is a scammer.  100%, no exceptions.   With his ID and SSN, you can steal his identity and everything he has.  Only scammers send this information (it's fake, BTW, likely stolen).  It is critical that you have the adult level judgement to know that a wealthy successful man is not going send you all the information  you need to steal his identity; rather, he will be doing everything he can to protect and  hide that information.  Adult judgement wise, this should be raising huge red flags. Only for scammer victims does it \"prove he's serious\".\n\nYou have three separate things, clearly mentioned in the scam thread, that indicate 100% of the time, this is a scam.   Moreover, as explained in detail in that thread, even if your check clears to your account in a few days, it will be found to be fraudulent and reversed in the coming days or weeks.  You'll be liable for paying it back, plus any fees, plus sometimes the bank will drop your account.  If you're not sure, feel free to just sit on it -- I 100% guarantee you this will all come to pass!",

Hell, if your longterm, trusted SD gives you a check -- well that's fine, you trust him, you know he's not a scammer, so no problem.\n\nBut, no legit in the history of the universe is going to insist that checks -- and ONLY checks (which reveal his actual identity) -- are how he'll offer financial assistance, from the very first time. And if no legit SDs do that ... it means everyone who insists on checks is a scammer.   That's how it works out in practice, every \"SD\" insisting on sending you a check for your first allowance, is a scammer; they've chosen to scam you via check, because it's super easy to do so",

            "body": ">If a SD sends me a pic of a check to deposit in my bank, am I able to deposit it and get the money?\n\nThis is clearly listed in the \"always a scam\" section.   What you're describing is the same as what I'm listing below, right?  Is there some reason you don't see the match that it's always a scam?  Here it is right  from the article:\n\n* He wants to send you a check or picture of a check to deposit\n\n>Then like not ever send him money so I wouldn\u2019t lose money if it was fake and the money actually isn\u2019t deposited??\n\nYes you'll lose money.  This is **always a scam**.  Which means you're going to be fraudulently depositing a check into your account.  Once the fraud is found out, the money will be withdrawn and your bank will hold you accountable for any subsequent fees.\n\n>He sent me proof of someone else depositing it\n\nAgain, straight from the article in the **always a scam** section:\n\n* He shows you screenshots of his bank accounts and/or transfers he's made to previous SBs\n\nHe did not send you proof of anything.  You do know it's trivially easy to fake a screenshot, right?  You're not ready for the bowl if this is something confusing.  Is there some reason the article isn't clear on all of this?\n\n>don\u2019t want to get scammed or do anything illegal so I just want to know  if this is something smart to do or if I should just block him??\n\nYes you're getting scammed, yes it's illegal, yes you should block him just like the article says\n\n>He said the same thing about the not being able to venmo or anything because his last SB stole from him.\n\nAgain, this is listed in the **always a scam** section.  No reason to question it -- it matches what we described, block and move on.\n\nFor anyone reading this, if any **one** thing you're experiencing matches the always a scam section, you are being scammed, block and move on. No need to question it.  If you're getting two or three things that super clearly match what we've described, there should be no question.  This is a good example of how when you're really hopeful, sometimes your mind wants you not to believe it's a scam, even when there are clear, exact matches to our scam article.",

You should block him immediately on all platforms, so he can't contact you again.\n\nWith your email and phone number, he can easily find your real name.

Scammer claims to have tried to send you CashApp but hit some limit at his bank, for which he needs a $30 registration fee to clear.  He will show you a screenshot showing the failed cashapp transaction and message about the registration fee (as discussed, all screenshots are fraudulent, so it's fake).  He will tell  you that you need to send the $30 registration fee, so that you can get your $2500 allowance.  You send $30 fee, he ghosts.\n2. He sends CashApp for more than he said he would.  Asks you to send the extra on to someone else, possibly in the form of a gift card.  You're happy to do that, since you know CashApp can't be reversed, so you send a $100 gift card to his associate.  Then the CashApp he sent is found to be fraudulent and reversed (yes, cashapp can be reversed in the case of fraud); so you're out the $100 gift card.",

Not a single one, not ever. This makes sense to me -- if there are SMs who are interested in young men, she has her pick of the litter and can find them in person.\n* There are occasionally -- rarely -- stories of male SBs who met their SMs freestyling or other in-person means.  We never get enough info to **really** convince me, but it seems vaguely believable.\n\nThere are definitely SMs out there for female SBs.

Is that true? I have spoken with several potential sugar daddies and they all wanted me to send them a card or some money (clearance fee?) in order for me to receive my allowance. Were they all scammers?\nThank you very much",

A naive SB who is out of her depth, should not be coached to play 1-out-of-1000 odds.  And \"pay through your business\" is probably more like 1 out of 10,000 or worse.  I don't think we do any SB any favors, basically telling her it \"could be\" a scam -- \"could be\" doesn't nearly do justice to it.\n2. All of these are for initial financial support, with essentially someone untrusted.  Many of these things are perfectly safe with someone you trust.  Crypto, for example, is a perfectly fine way to go when it's a trusted SD; too easy for an SB to get scammed if it's someone untrusted and unknown.  Similarly, if an SB's trusted SD wants to do a payroll type deal, well she knows him well enough.  But this is aimed at untrusted POTs.    Which raises the question -- did you start your very first PPM or allowance as a business payroll type check?  Or was this down the line, after you'd been in an SR for a while and she trusted you?  If the latter, then this advice doesn't apply -- are we're back to 1000/1000 times it's a scam, when it's merely a POT\n\nMake sense?",

Scam thread aside, just adult judgement should tell you that a legit wealthy man -- or any adult man -- is going to let you just have access to their bank account?  \n\nJust as in the other case, the transfers will seem to go through, he'll ask you for some favors (e.g., send money on to someone else, send nudie pics, etc) and then sometime down the line the transfers will get automatically reversed.  You'll be responsible for paying back all the money, plus fines.",

Here is the exact quote from the scam thread, so you know what to look for in the future. I am going to guess, based on your description, that this applies also:\n\n>He has not met you yet, or gotten any value from the relationship at all, but he wants to transfer large sums to you or pay off your credit cards or loans\n\nThese are clear matches, right?\n\nAs far as how the scam works, the bank transfer you make is going to eventually get reversed.  It will be reversed by the scammer possibly, or possibly because it's not even the scammer's bank account so you are fraudulently accessing it and transferring money out of it to yourself. In any case, it will get reversed.  You will be responsible for paying it all back, plus the fees and penalties associated with the fraudulent transfer; in some cases, your bank will drop you.\n\nAs far as the scam itself, when you transfer the money, the scammer will ask for something from you.  Maybe they'll tell you \"please help me out, transfer an extra $300, and then send it on to my business associate\".  That transfer you do to his \"business associate\" (the scammer themselves) can't be reversed, so you're out the $300.  Or maybe once you do the transfer, he'll ask you for nudie pics or whatever.\n\nI'm going to sound snarkier than I mean to, but it's really important you understand this: it's critical you use adult judgement in the bowl.   Do you really believe a wealthy successful person is going to give a stranger on the internet, access to their bank account, and just let them transfer money out of it???  As an adult, it's important you know that real adults don't do this.  This is all putting aside that online SMs don't exist.  Real SDs (and the very very few SMs out there) will give you cash when you see them in person.  If you're going to continue doing online interactions, you'll want learn how online content sellers and online sexworkers protect themselves.  They are not going into people's bank accounts, accepting checks, allowing people to directly transfer money to their credit cards or bank accounts, etc. -- these are **always** scams.  Good luck!",

The reason we know this person is a scammer is because they cold contacted you, and want to give you money for online companionship -- that's the 100% tell on the scam.

I don't understand how any SB would ever even consider sending an unknown SD money in any situation.  \n\nYou know that, and I know that, and nevertheless this scam is being done incredibly often.  And, I've had to get more and more specific -- e.g., I originally had examples like \"don't buy them a visa or steam card\" , and I'd hear from an SB that she got scammed even though she'd read the scam thread, because the scammer asked for an app store card, not visa or steam.  So I had to add more examples and then \"or any other card whatsoever\".  \n\nYour example of sending $ for pics is one of those that sometimes works out, but far more often won't.  I think engaging in content selling/buying with a POT is a terrible practice that leads to disappointment most of the time regardless, but that's a separate topic.   And yes, agree, I haven't done a full list of how SDs get scammed, just because it's SBs who seem to get scammed more often",

I have never offered $ for pics there are billions of free ones available on this brand new thing called the internet lol.\n\nI can't speak to whether SD's or SB's get scammed more, but I can say that based on everything I'm reading and have heard a SB should see it coming because if a man EVER asks for money in any way from you, unless it's like a $5 to tip a valet after dinner bc he doesn't have change, then they are scamming you.  Just don't ever do it.\n\nI can also say that I have had more than one SB criminal scamming situations that turned really ugly and a lot of things came to light once the authorities got involved.  I mentioned those items above (extortion, blackmail, faking pregnancies to extort men etc.) because those aren't uncommon occurrences.  The connecting thread that the authorities figured out, which I already knew even though some didn't involve me, was that these specific crimes / scams were being committed by women related back to SA (i.e SB;s).

I wanted him to understand what behavior is a red flag to SBs, so he could avoid it.

Obviously, sometimes it DOES work out just fine ,but there's always some element of risk, starting from the issue you're bringing up (how to book the flight without giving your info), to the subconscious pressure you'll put on yourself to put out since he paid for your flight and hotel.  Best left to experienced SBs IMO.\n\nFor the plane flight, one of you is going to have to take a risk.  Either he cashapps you the money in advance and trusts that you're going to book a flight with it rather than ghost, or you give him all your personal details and he books the flight.  It's difficult for me to understand why neither of you can find a partner closer, so as not to have to deal with this.",

Cause like you said in your experience, they're usually quick to respond, quick to the point...it usually don't take long to see what their intentions are at all, or sometimes they don't type English well.

Smart move is to just block and move on.\n\nIf you find yourself driven to seek revenge, the thing I've seen people do is just waste the scammer's time.  Engage them in long conversation, tell them the transfer didn't work, argue with them, etc.  You'll waste your own time too, but if for you it's entertainment, for them it's their livelihood and time is money.  I do suspect there are risks to this, and don't recommend it, but it's the one thing you can do if you're driven to revenge lol",

We don't have to go further than this -- it's a scam, with 100% certainty.\n\nThere is no such thing as someone who will send you money \"through her clients\".  This is a place where you need to have adult level judgement -- no, someone isn't having their clients send you money.  Nor does she need help with buying bitcoin -- bitcoin is trivially easy to buy anonymously, ONLY SCAMMERS say this.  Again, adult judgement: someone wealthy enough to be an SM, would not require help buying bitcoin.  And the kicker, she's in Peru lol.\n\nOkay, seriously, this is pretty bad in how obvious it is.

Here is the exact quote from the scam thread, so you know what to look for in the future. I am going to guess, based on your description, that this applies also:\n\n>He has not met you yet, or gotten any value from the relationship at all, but he wants to transfer large sums to you or pay off your credit cards or loans\n\nThese are clear matches, right?\n\nAs far as how the scam works, the bank transfer you make is going to eventually get reversed.  It will be reversed by the scammer possibly, or possibly because it's not even the scammer's bank account so you are fraudulently accessing it and transferring money out of it to yourself. In any case, it will get reversed.  You will be responsible for paying it all back, plus the fees and penalties associated with the fraudulent transfer; in some cases, your bank will drop you.\n\nAs far as the scam itself, when you transfer the money, the scammer will ask for something from you.  Maybe they'll tell you \"please help me out, transfer an extra $300, and then send it on to my business associate\".  That transfer you do to his \"business associate\" (the scammer themselves) can't be reversed, so you're out the $300.  Or maybe once you do the transfer, he'll ask you for nudie pics or whatever.\n\nI'm going to sound snarkier than I mean to, but it's really important you understand this: it's critical you use adult judgement in the bowl.   Do you really believe a wealthy successful person is going to give a stranger on the internet, access to their bank account, and just let them transfer money out of it???  As an adult, it's important you know that real adults don't do this.  This is all putting aside that online SMs don't exist.  Real SDs (and the very very few SMs out there) will give you cash when you see them in person.  If you're going to continue doing online interactions, you'll want learn how online content sellers and online sexworkers protect themselves.  They are not going into people's bank accounts, accepting checks, allowing people to directly transfer money to their credit cards or bank accounts, etc. -- these are **always** scams.  Good luck!",

Usually we move to text instead of something like telegram, so that's a little suspicious I suppose. Not sure it's necessarily a scam yet but I would be cautious",

The reason we know this person is a scammer is because they cold contacted you, and want to give you money for online companionship -- that's the 100% tell on the scam.

Just don't ever do it.\n\nI can also say that I have had more than one SB criminal scamming situations that turned really ugly and a lot of things came to light once the authorities got involved.  I mentioned those items above (extortion, blackmail, faking pregnancies to extort men etc.) because those aren't uncommon occurrences.  The connecting thread that the authorities figured out, which I already knew even though some didn't involve me, was that these specific crimes / scams were being committed by women related back to SA (i.e SB;s).

Obviously, sometimes it DOES work out just fine ,but there's always some element of risk, starting from the issue you're bringing up (how to book the flight without giving your info), to the subconscious pressure you'll put on yourself to put out since he paid for your flight and hotel.  Best left to experienced SBs IMO.\n\nFor the plane flight, one of you is going to have to take a risk.  Either he cashapps you the money in advance and trusts that you're going to book a flight with it rather than ghost, or you give him all your personal details and he books the flight.  It's difficult for me to understand why neither of you can find a partner closer, so as not to have to deal with this.",

No one chats faster than a scammer or a teenager in India, I tell ya. I'm sorry that she was able to get so close. \ud83d\ude2d She must have gauged by my responses that I was onto 'her'. Once she mentioned that she was looking for a sugar baby, I said, you're awfully young to be such a generous sugar mama, and then came the spiel about working for her father's business and then the help me help you with Bitcoin atm blah blah blah. I tried to scam the scammer, but she was onto me as well. Her messages are still sitting in my inbox, after she told me to get a bank account with a specific bank.",

We casually just chatted for weeks. About looks, makeup, life, guys, our children, etc. My guard went up once she mentioned making money together naturally and I let her at least explain it to me then once she did I was like WOW this is probably the most patient damn scammer I've ever met. Cause like you said in your experience, they're usually quick to respond, quick to the point...it usually don't take long to see what their intentions are at all, or sometimes they don't type English well. She wrote in English very well. One red flag I noticed, was that we both followed seeking on Instagram. So now ANYONE who writes me on Instagram that follows seeking, I assume for sure is a scammer.",

I told her no and she went straight to that she was looking for a 'loyal and honest baby' < that's intro to scamming speak. Then I just entertained the conversation out of boredom. She had this whole backstory, but the fun started when she said she was 35. I was thinking, 35 and you're a sugar MAMA?! When she got into the bitcoin, forex stuff, I was really hoping I could scam a scammer, but alas, I was outsmarted by cash app. For future reference, I highly doubt there are any serious SDs following Seeking. I think that both the Seeking page and Brandon's pages are more for SBs to ask questions, complain, and enter giveaways.",

Here is the exact quote from the scam thread, so you know what to look for in the future. I am going to guess, based on your description, that this applies also:\n\n>He has not met you yet, or gotten any value from the relationship at all, but he wants to transfer large sums to you or pay off your credit cards or loans\n\nThese are clear matches, right?\n\nAs far as how the scam works, the bank transfer you make is going to eventually get reversed.  It will be reversed by the scammer possibly, or possibly because it's not even the scammer's bank account so you are fraudulently accessing it and transferring money out of it to yourself. In any case, it will get reversed.  You will be responsible for paying it all back, plus the fees and penalties associated with the fraudulent transfer; in some cases, your bank will drop you.\n\nAs far as the scam itself, when you transfer the money, the scammer will ask for something from you.  Maybe they'll tell you \"please help me out, transfer an extra $300, and then send it on to my business associate\".  That transfer you do to his \"business associate\" (the scammer themselves) can't be reversed, so you're out the $300.  Or maybe once you do the transfer, he'll ask you for nudie pics or whatever.\n\nI'm going to sound snarkier than I mean to, but it's really important you understand this: it's critical you use adult judgement in the bowl.   Do you really believe a wealthy successful person is going to give a stranger on the internet, access to their bank account, and just let them transfer money out of it???  As an adult, it's important you know that real adults don't do this.  This is all putting aside that online SMs don't exist.  Real SDs (and the very very few SMs out there) will give you cash when you see them in person.  If you're going to continue doing online interactions, you'll want learn how online content sellers and online sexworkers protect themselves.  They are not going into people's bank accounts, accepting checks, allowing people to directly transfer money to their credit cards or bank accounts, etc. -- these are **always** scams.  Good luck!",

First thing she wrote me was \"Have we met on SA before?\" And same as you, I'm like nooo, I don't seek women. And she's all huh, how weird, you look familiar...then she just started casually talking to me. Nice try on trying to scam the scammer though, LOL, and I agree, the only point for following them is to ask questions or enter giveaways, personally I enter giveaways. In fact I won one recently lol.",

Engage them in long conversation, tell them the transfer didn't work, argue with them, etc.  You'll waste your own time too, but if for you it's entertainment, for them it's their livelihood and time is money.  I do suspect there are risks to this, and don't recommend it, but it's the one thing you can do if you're driven to revenge lol",
