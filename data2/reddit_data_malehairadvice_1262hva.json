Teeth whitening may also not be preferred since it can cause tooth sensitivity, and some people may prefer comfort over looks. Another point to mention is that some people with teeth that aren\u2019t perfectly white etc, is not due to lack of hygiene, but rather a health condition, or past/current drug use, in these cases, the solution is not as simple as just going and getting a cleaning. Lastly, their teeth may not bother them at all. There are many places in the world that do not prioritize having white or straight teeth and that is perfectly normal. All that being said, fixing your teeth is not an immediate fix. Whereas a haircut, or makeup etc, are things people can do immediately to improve their look/ self esteem etc.",

And it isn\u2019t cheap to just go fix. And like op said that also means time off work. \nOn the other hand my husband has decaying teeth from poor decisions as a youth, and has spent most of his adulthood saving up for the tens of thousands it will cost for replacing his teeth. He is sometimes insecure about his teeth, but I gotta say, he is very handsome and still has a wonderful smile despite the damage. Peoples beauty is so much more than just their teeth lol\u2026",

Teeth whitening may also not be preferred since it can cause tooth sensitivity, and some people may prefer comfort over looks. Another point to mention is that some people with teeth that aren\u2019t perfectly white etc, is not due to lack of hygiene, but rather a health condition, or past/current drug use, in these cases, the solution is not as simple as just going and getting a cleaning. Lastly, their teeth may not bother them at all. There are many places in the world that do not prioritize having white or straight teeth and that is perfectly normal. All that being said, fixing your teeth is not an immediate fix. Whereas a haircut, or makeup etc, are things people can do immediately to improve their look/ self esteem etc.",

I\u2019m guessing the commenter had parents to pay for their dental care all throughout childhood, and now that they have decent teeth as an adult thanks to their parents, they feel the need to bash others who don\u2019t. In my own case I never had any health/dental care until recently as an adult\u2026 I take good care of my hygiene yet I still have several cavities over the years. And it isn\u2019t cheap to just go fix. And like op said that also means time off work. \nOn the other hand my husband has decaying teeth from poor decisions as a youth, and has spent most of his adulthood saving up for the tens of thousands it will cost for replacing his teeth. He is sometimes insecure about his teeth, but I gotta say, he is very handsome and still has a wonderful smile despite the damage. Peoples beauty is so much more than just their teeth lol\u2026",

I\u2019m guessing the commenter had parents to pay for their dental care all throughout childhood, and now that they have decent teeth as an adult thanks to their parents, they feel the need to bash others who don\u2019t. In my own case I never had any health/dental care until recently as an adult\u2026 I take good care of my hygiene yet I still have several cavities over the years. And it isn\u2019t cheap to just go fix. And like op said that also means time off work. \nOn the other hand my husband has decaying teeth from poor decisions as a youth, and has spent most of his adulthood saving up for the tens of thousands it will cost for replacing his teeth. He is sometimes insecure about his teeth, but I gotta say, he is very handsome and still has a wonderful smile despite the damage. Peoples beauty is so much more than just their teeth lol\u2026",
