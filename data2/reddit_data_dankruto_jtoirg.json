IIRC canonically hers is stronger than Tsunade's and we know what Tsunade can survive. Also, being canonically stronger than Tsunade and Jiraiya and Tsunade being somewhat equivalent should mean Sakura can beat/somewhat equal Jiraiya\n\nC) Bit of a tossup. Shikamaru's feats in universe are inconsistent. His intelligence is vastly overstated (since writers can't write characters smarter than themselves and Kishi was no Shikamaru level genius) so depends on how they portray that intelligence. I'd say Sakura's feats are far more impressive.",

It isn\u2019t like dbz where the higher power level should be all but guaranteed to win. \n\nJiraiya perfectly counters Nagato.  He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths. If it were a fair fight, he\u2019d have won because of his versatility.\n\nJiraiya is one of the three strongest characters that we see that don\u2019t have a bloodline. Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

Her dodging an attack isn't impressive.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the only reason Kaguya was even able to show up in the first place. Fucking Sakura. The only useful thing she does during the war is keep Naruto alive long enough to get 9 tails back, and summon Katsuyu.",

Sakura in her prime is stronger than most Kages, it was clear in her fight against Shin that she\u2019s a lot stronger and more skilled than she was in the war. And as stated at the end of the war she was already stronger than Tsunade, therefore most likely stronger than the fourth Raikage and Mangekyou Sasuke.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

Madara did compare the two and said that Tsunade was slower, but stronger. So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive.

All those things were in the manga and they are the reasons why ppl hate her honestly. Starting from there, it would have took a REALLY good development in order to make her popular again but the one she got wasnt even that great.\nI personnally have nothing against her and i tend to find the sakura slender boring but i blame kishi for that.",

Normally, Naruto ain't doing anything and Sakura just punches him for no reason, and then things continue as if it didnt even happen. And its like.. wtf. Leave our boy alone betch",

Nor do I think its fair to call her useless, considering her achievements.\n\n No she didn't stop Madara or Pain or Kaguya, but the work she put in to master chakra control, medical ninjutsu, taijutsu, and the strength of 100 seal? All I say is give her her credit where its due. Not everyone could do even half of that. I think its fair to say its a shame she only got that power after basically the whole show ended, but she did still earn that power.\n\nMy other comment is long but its basically just me explaining why Sakura and Sasuke's relationship is a real relationship.",

But their relationship did have a real component back before Sasuke left the village, when Team 7 was still Team 7. Sakura and Sasuke faught as teammates, and saved each others lives on multiple occasions. Her feelings for him are/were genuine. He's not just a pretty face to her, he's her valued comrad. And it hurt her when he left just like it did Naruto.\n\nAnd although its true that Sasuke did try to kill her, and that there is no excuse for that, keep in mind that Sasuke didn't just instantly hook up with Sakura after he decided to join the Leaf again.\n\n Several years passed and they went on several missions together as they slowly developed a relationship, went on dates, and eventually decided to get married, probably after Sakura got pregnant. I'm sure they actually talked about Sasuke trying to kill Sakura, or even Sakura trying to kill him, and properly forgave each other over this period of time. After all, the time that they were on opposite teams, when Sasuke left, was only 2 years. After he came back, after he lost to Naruto, they had like at least 10+ years to patch things up, get married, and have a kid thats already 13/14(?) years old. (In the show) So the few things that did happen in those mere 2 years become a thing of the past.\n\nYea their relationship isn't perfect, but that entire period of their lives wasn't pretty for anyone, considering it was all basically leading up to the 4rth War, and Kaguya. And no relationship is perfect anyway. So I just don't feel that their relationship needs to be justified or needs to be better. They're doing just fine.\n\nSakura's relationship with Sasuke is pretty much the only flaw people like to point out about her, well thats my opinion about it. \n\nOther than that Sakura is awesome, she exemplifies that you define yourself through hard work and dedication. She didn't just accept being a weak third wheel to Naruto and Sasuke, she created a goal to become stronger and redefined herself as a member of Team 7, and a Hidden Leaf ninja. She went from weak genin to above kage level in just 2 years. Thats something that I think anyone who feels stuck in life can learn from.",

Do you not remember how she even came to like Sasuke? It was when they were still little kids before the academy and only liked him FOR LOOKS. Sure their relationship could have developed as the show progressed but the back bone of that entire relationship was because sakura thought he was cute and sasuke didn\u2019t give a fuck about her. Yes shes a respectable shinobi and she was determined to work to be the best her she could be, but that got her damn near no-where as we see in the pain arc, if Sakura was so determined not to be the weak link of team 7, why didn\u2019t she jump in when naruto was in trouble?? Her declaration that she didn\u2019t want to be weak was in the War Arc when-who woulda guessed it- SASUKE SHOWS UP!!!. Bad writing = bad character.",

But their relationship was clearly more than that seeing as they were on the same team and did save each other's lives. Not just Sasuke saving her, she was there to defend and heal him when he was vulnerable many times as well. So their relationship is not just \"oh I think he's cute.\" That was literally my whole argument. I went out of my way to disclaim that before you could even say it, because I knew you would, but you come back saying just that anyway. Okay \n\nI just think its funny that you feel that you can judge their relationship when choosing to marry Sakura was Sasuke's decision himself. I would think that that would be enough for everyone to respect their relationship, that you could just respect his decision, but I guess you know whats best for Sasuke, even more so than himself, right? Yea no he totally shouldn't be with her, he's just too dumb to see it",

I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship.

Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic.

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Also, being canonically stronger than Tsunade and Jiraiya and Tsunade being somewhat equivalent should mean Sakura can beat/somewhat equal Jiraiya\n\nC) Bit of a tossup. Shikamaru's feats in universe are inconsistent. His intelligence is vastly overstated (since writers can't write characters smarter than themselves and Kishi was no Shikamaru level genius) so depends on how they portray that intelligence. I'd say Sakura's feats are far more impressive.",

It isn\u2019t like dbz where the higher power level should be all but guaranteed to win. \n\nJiraiya perfectly counters Nagato.  He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths. If it were a fair fight, he\u2019d have won because of his versatility.\n\nJiraiya is one of the three strongest characters that we see that don\u2019t have a bloodline. Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

There\u2019s no way Jiraiya stomps low diff, at best he barely wins high-extreme diff. Jiraiya was weaker than Naruto by the point that Naruto learned Sage mode, so not exactly extremely powerful. Sakura was at least as powerful as Tsunade by the end of the war, and has only grown more powerful afterwards. The only way Jiraiya even stands a chance is if he goes into sage mode, and Sakura knows how sage mode works and could hinder him from going into it. Jiraiya has practically no jutsu that could damage her in strength of 100 seal mode.",

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

Madara did compare the two and said that Tsunade was slower, but stronger. So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive.

Normally, Naruto ain't doing anything and Sakura just punches him for no reason, and then things continue as if it didnt even happen. And its like.. wtf. Leave our boy alone betch",

                    "body": "What you're saying is true, but there is stuff that goes in favor of their relationship that people don't seem to recognize.\n\nA lot of people feel like Sakura's attraction to Sasuke was shallow in the first place because she had a mere crush on him for only his looks. But their relationship did have a real component back before Sasuke left the village, when Team 7 was still Team 7. Sakura and Sasuke faught as teammates, and saved each others lives on multiple occasions. Her feelings for him are/were genuine. He's not just a pretty face to her, he's her valued comrad. And it hurt her when he left just like it did Naruto.\n\nAnd although its true that Sasuke did try to kill her, and that there is no excuse for that, keep in mind that Sasuke didn't just instantly hook up with Sakura after he decided to join the Leaf again.\n\n Several years passed and they went on several missions together as they slowly developed a relationship, went on dates, and eventually decided to get married, probably after Sakura got pregnant. I'm sure they actually talked about Sasuke trying to kill Sakura, or even Sakura trying to kill him, and properly forgave each other over this period of time. After all, the time that they were on opposite teams, when Sasuke left, was only 2 years. After he came back, after he lost to Naruto, they had like at least 10+ years to patch things up, get married, and have a kid thats already 13/14(?) years old. (In the show) So the few things that did happen in those mere 2 years become a thing of the past.\n\nYea their relationship isn't perfect, but that entire period of their lives wasn't pretty for anyone, considering it was all basically leading up to the 4rth War, and Kaguya. And no relationship is perfect anyway. So I just don't feel that their relationship needs to be justified or needs to be better. They're doing just fine.\n\nSakura's relationship with Sasuke is pretty much the only flaw people like to point out about her, well thats my opinion about it. \n\nOther than that Sakura is awesome, she exemplifies that you define yourself through hard work and dedication. She didn't just accept being a weak third wheel to Naruto and Sasuke, she created a goal to become stronger and redefined herself as a member of Team 7, and a Hidden Leaf ninja. She went from weak genin to above kage level in just 2 years. Thats something that I think anyone who feels stuck in life can learn from.",

Sure their relationship could have developed as the show progressed but the back bone of that entire relationship was because sakura thought he was cute and sasuke didn\u2019t give a fuck about her. Yes shes a respectable shinobi and she was determined to work to be the best her she could be, but that got her damn near no-where as we see in the pain arc, if Sakura was so determined not to be the weak link of team 7, why didn\u2019t she jump in when naruto was in trouble??

So their relationship is not just \"oh I think he's cute.\" That was literally my whole argument. I went out of my way to disclaim that before you could even say it, because I knew you would, but you come back saying just that anyway. Okay \n\nI just think its funny that you feel that you can judge their relationship when choosing to marry Sakura was Sasuke's decision himself. I would think that that would be enough for everyone to respect their relationship, that you could just respect his decision, but I guess you know whats best for Sasuke, even more so than himself, right?

I\u2019ll admit that i was being a troll in regards to my last reply, but i just don\u2019t believe anyone in their right mind would date and produce a child with someone like Sasuke. I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship. And for this is why I don\u2019t like or agree with Sakura or Sasuke and Sakuras relationship at all, but unfortunately its cannon so it is what it is.",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke. Old Sasuke was embarrassed to even think about his past decisions. Naruto really changed him.",

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

NO connection or attraction in the real world would make a woman stay with a man who tried to kill her three times,  a man who called her a piece of crap, tried to destroy her village (her parents included), tried to kill her best friend and tried to become Emperor of the World and implant a evil dictatorship. If it wasn't for Naruto, they would all be enslaved.  \n\n\nHe said; \"sorry\" - and she dropped her panties. How can you ask for us to respect a character like that?",

I think you just like hating Sakura because you saw a few scenes that you didn't like and decided that you would hate her forever. Like I said, I'm really sorry you feel that way.",

What is she gonna do in that fight, she will be occupied fighting all the summon creatures until her healing runs out, even if she gets past that she has to deal with every pain wich would be problematic on their own plus the pains can be revived and her abilities are basically run in and punch, no way she can get to the backline to take out the pain that revives others she doesnt have the level of trickery that naruto used to take him out, i dont see how she would beat the deva path once his powers returned and they would definetly return in time, naruto was slapping the paths left and right and his powers returned in time i doubt sakura would even get past the summons.",

Also, being canonically stronger than Tsunade and Jiraiya and Tsunade being somewhat equivalent should mean Sakura can beat/somewhat equal Jiraiya\n\nC) Bit of a tossup. Shikamaru's feats in universe are inconsistent. His intelligence is vastly overstated (since writers can't write characters smarter than themselves and Kishi was no Shikamaru level genius) so depends on how they portray that intelligence.

It isn\u2019t like dbz where the higher power level should be all but guaranteed to win. \n\nJiraiya perfectly counters Nagato.  He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths. If it were a fair fight, he\u2019d have won because of his versatility.\n\nJiraiya is one of the three strongest characters that we see that don\u2019t have a bloodline. Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

Sakura in her prime is stronger than most Kages, it was clear in her fight against Shin that she\u2019s a lot stronger and more skilled than she was in the war. And as stated at the end of the war she was already stronger than Tsunade, therefore most likely stronger than the fourth Raikage and Mangekyou Sasuke.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

Madara did compare the two and said that Tsunade was slower, but stronger. So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Tsunade didn't even come close to Madara, but she put up a decent fight with the other five Kage. Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

            "body": "What you're saying is true, but there is stuff that goes in favor of their relationship that people don't seem to recognize.\n\nA lot of people feel like Sakura's attraction to Sasuke was shallow in the first place because she had a mere crush on him for only his looks. But their relationship did have a real component back before Sasuke left the village, when Team 7 was still Team 7. Sakura and Sasuke faught as teammates, and saved each others lives on multiple occasions. Her feelings for him are/were genuine. He's not just a pretty face to her, he's her valued comrad. And it hurt her when he left just like it did Naruto.\n\nAnd although its true that Sasuke did try to kill her, and that there is no excuse for that, keep in mind that Sasuke didn't just instantly hook up with Sakura after he decided to join the Leaf again.\n\n Several years passed and they went on several missions together as they slowly developed a relationship, went on dates, and eventually decided to get married, probably after Sakura got pregnant. I'm sure they actually talked about Sasuke trying to kill Sakura, or even Sakura trying to kill him, and properly forgave each other over this period of time. After all, the time that they were on opposite teams, when Sasuke left, was only 2 years. After he came back, after he lost to Naruto, they had like at least 10+ years to patch things up, get married, and have a kid thats already 13/14(?) years old. (In the show) So the few things that did happen in those mere 2 years become a thing of the past.\n\nYea their relationship isn't perfect, but that entire period of their lives wasn't pretty for anyone, considering it was all basically leading up to the 4rth War, and Kaguya. And no relationship is perfect anyway. So I just don't feel that their relationship needs to be justified or needs to be better. They're doing just fine.\n\nSakura's relationship with Sasuke is pretty much the only flaw people like to point out about her, well thats my opinion about it. \n\nOther than that Sakura is awesome, she exemplifies that you define yourself through hard work and dedication. She didn't just accept being a weak third wheel to Naruto and Sasuke, she created a goal to become stronger and redefined herself as a member of Team 7, and a Hidden Leaf ninja. She went from weak genin to above kage level in just 2 years. Thats something that I think anyone who feels stuck in life can learn from.",

Sure their relationship could have developed as the show progressed but the back bone of that entire relationship was because sakura thought he was cute and sasuke didn\u2019t give a fuck about her. Yes shes a respectable shinobi and she was determined to work to be the best her she could be, but that got her damn near no-where as we see in the pain arc, if Sakura was so determined not to be the weak link of team 7, why didn\u2019t she jump in when naruto was in trouble??

But their relationship was clearly more than that seeing as they were on the same team and did save each other's lives. Not just Sasuke saving her, she was there to defend and heal him when he was vulnerable many times as well. So their relationship is not just \"oh I think he's cute.\" That was literally my whole argument. I went out of my way to disclaim that before you could even say it, because I knew you would, but you come back saying just that anyway. Okay \n\nI just think its funny that you feel that you can judge their relationship when choosing to marry Sakura was Sasuke's decision himself. I would think that that would be enough for everyone to respect their relationship, that you could just respect his decision, but I guess you know whats best for Sasuke, even more so than himself, right? Yea no he totally shouldn't be with her, he's just too dumb to see it",

I do not like Sakura because she\u2019s written terribly as a main cast member, and the choices she makes in boruto and in her past in part one and in shippuden. I\u2019ll admit that i was being a troll in regards to my last reply, but i just don\u2019t believe anyone in their right mind would date and produce a child with someone like Sasuke. I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship. And for this is why I don\u2019t like or agree with Sakura or Sasuke and Sakuras relationship at all, but unfortunately its cannon so it is what it is.",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke.

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

NO connection or attraction in the real world would make a woman stay with a man who tried to kill her three times,  a man who called her a piece of crap, tried to destroy her village (her parents included), tried to kill her best friend and tried to become Emperor of the World and implant a evil dictatorship. If it wasn't for Naruto, they would all be enslaved.  \n\n\nHe said; \"sorry\" - and she dropped her panties. How can you ask for us to respect a character like that?",

I think you just like hating Sakura because you saw a few scenes that you didn't like and decided that you would hate her forever. Like I said, I'm really sorry you feel that way.",

It isn\u2019t like dbz where the higher power level should be all but guaranteed to win. \n\nJiraiya perfectly counters Nagato.  He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths. If it were a fair fight, he\u2019d have won because of his versatility.\n\nJiraiya is one of the three strongest characters that we see that don\u2019t have a bloodline. Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

Sakura in her prime is stronger than most Kages, it was clear in her fight against Shin that she\u2019s a lot stronger and more skilled than she was in the war. And as stated at the end of the war she was already stronger than Tsunade, therefore most likely stronger than the fourth Raikage and Mangekyou Sasuke.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

                                                                    "body": "I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s all head canon. Madara did compare the two and said that Tsunade was slower, but stronger. So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

Nor do I think its fair to call her useless, considering her achievements.\n\n No she didn't stop Madara or Pain or Kaguya, but the work she put in to master chakra control, medical ninjutsu, taijutsu, and the strength of 100 seal? All I say is give her her credit where its due. Not everyone could do even half of that. I think its fair to say its a shame she only got that power after basically the whole show ended, but she did still earn that power.\n\nMy other comment is long but its basically just me explaining why Sakura and Sasuke's relationship is a real relationship.",

Sure their relationship could have developed as the show progressed but the back bone of that entire relationship was because sakura thought he was cute and sasuke didn\u2019t give a fuck about her. Yes shes a respectable shinobi and she was determined to work to be the best her she could be, but that got her damn near no-where as we see in the pain arc, if Sakura was so determined not to be the weak link of team 7, why didn\u2019t she jump in when naruto was in trouble?? Her declaration that she didn\u2019t want to be weak was in the War Arc when-who woulda guessed it- SASUKE SHOWS UP!!!. Bad writing = bad character.",

So their relationship is not just \"oh I think he's cute.\" That was literally my whole argument. I went out of my way to disclaim that before you could even say it, because I knew you would, but you come back saying just that anyway. Okay \n\nI just think its funny that you feel that you can judge their relationship when choosing to marry Sakura was Sasuke's decision himself. I would think that that would be enough for everyone to respect their relationship, that you could just respect his decision, but I guess you know whats best for Sasuke, even more so than himself, right?

I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship. And for this is why I don\u2019t like or agree with Sakura or Sasuke and Sakuras relationship at all, but unfortunately its cannon so it is what it is.",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic.

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

NO connection or attraction in the real world would make a woman stay with a man who tried to kill her three times,  a man who called her a piece of crap, tried to destroy her village (her parents included), tried to kill her best friend and tried to become Emperor of the World and implant a evil dictatorship. If it wasn't for Naruto, they would all be enslaved.  \n\n\nHe said; \"sorry\" - and she dropped her panties. How can you ask for us to respect a character like that?",

His intelligence is vastly overstated (since writers can't write characters smarter than themselves and Kishi was no Shikamaru level genius) so depends on how they portray that intelligence.

He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths.

Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

Sakura was at least as powerful as Tsunade by the end of the war, and has only grown more powerful afterwards.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Tsunade didn't even come close to Madara, but she put up a decent fight with the other five Kage. Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

I'm just pointing out that the fact her character was wasted after this is even more sad when her one shining moment had a couple drawbacks to it",

The two nots cancel out meaning you just said \"can say anything that is hate\".\nThe opposite of hate, which you said by putting a negative in front of hate, is positive, so you are saying I can't say anything positive about her.....\n\nIt's like me saying I cannot not read whatever the fuck you are saying. Double negatives cancel out, meaning i said I can read whatever the fuck you are saying, which is untrue",

Nor do I think its fair to call her useless, considering her achievements.\n\n No she didn't stop Madara or Pain or Kaguya, but the work she put in to master chakra control, medical ninjutsu, taijutsu, and the strength of 100 seal? All I say is give her her credit where its due. Not everyone could do even half of that.

So their relationship is not just \"oh I think he's cute.\" That was literally my whole argument. I went out of my way to disclaim that before you could even say it, because I knew you would, but you come back saying just that anyway. Okay \n\nI just think its funny that you feel that you can judge their relationship when choosing to marry Sakura was Sasuke's decision himself. I would think that that would be enough for everyone to respect their relationship, that you could just respect his decision, but I guess you know whats best for Sasuke, even more so than himself, right? Yea no he totally shouldn't be with her, he's just too dumb to see it",

I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship.

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

So nobody is saying Sasuke is perfect.\n\nThe fact that most of their relationship isn't animated means that you can't really judge them. All we saw was 2-3 years and the rest of the 30+? Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore.

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Which is the same as what I mean by the English female voices doing the stereotypical passive female voice. It's annoying. Duh actors are acting but they have a choice of what tone to use when doing it Some just have a natural voice that they are able to sell and Sakura's actress is one of those. She doesn't go all nasally or high-pitched unless her character actually is motivated to talk like that, but it's not portrayed as her actual normal speaking voice.",

It isn\u2019t like dbz where the higher power level should be all but guaranteed to win. \n\nJiraiya perfectly counters Nagato.  He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths. If it were a fair fight, he\u2019d have won because of his versatility.\n\nJiraiya is one of the three strongest characters that we see that don\u2019t have a bloodline. Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

She is nowhere near the level of Kaguya or Sasuke or Naruto just because she dodged one attack. Naruto isn't anywhere near Kaguya's level of power either and he still managed to blitz her and go blow for blow by himself for a good while. Her dodging an attack isn't impressive.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the only reason Kaguya was even able to show up in the first place. Fucking Sakura. The only useful thing she does during the war is keep Naruto alive long enough to get 9 tails back, and summon Katsuyu.",

Sakura has one of the best chakra controls in the entire verse, best healing in the verse (not including god tiers self heal), and stronger physical strength than Tsunade. Sakura in her prime is stronger than most Kages, it was clear in her fight against Shin that she\u2019s a lot stronger and more skilled than she was in the war. And as stated at the end of the war she was already stronger than Tsunade, therefore most likely stronger than the fourth Raikage and Mangekyou Sasuke.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

Nor do I think its fair to call her useless, considering her achievements.\n\n No she didn't stop Madara or Pain or Kaguya, but the work she put in to master chakra control, medical ninjutsu, taijutsu, and the strength of 100 seal? All I say is give her her credit where its due. Not everyone could do even half of that.

I do not like Sakura because she\u2019s written terribly as a main cast member, and the choices she makes in boruto and in her past in part one and in shippuden. I\u2019ll admit that i was being a troll in regards to my last reply, but i just don\u2019t believe anyone in their right mind would date and produce a child with someone like Sasuke. I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship. And for this is why I don\u2019t like or agree with Sakura or Sasuke and Sakuras relationship at all, but unfortunately its cannon so it is what it is.",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke. Old Sasuke was embarrassed to even think about his past decisions. Naruto really changed him.",

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

She doesn't go all nasally or high-pitched unless her character actually is motivated to talk like that, but it's not portrayed as her actual normal speaking voice.",

It isn\u2019t like dbz where the higher power level should be all but guaranteed to win. \n\nJiraiya perfectly counters Nagato.  He has the stamina, the versatility, and sage mode to counter Nagato\u2019s paths. If it were a fair fight, he\u2019d have won because of his versatility.\n\nJiraiya is one of the three strongest characters that we see that don\u2019t have a bloodline. Minato and Hiruzen are the only ones that eclipse him. But, that doesn\u2019t make him invincible. Sakura\u2019s seal makes her near invincible from anything short of ripping her head off or her heart out(in other words, 100% definite fatal wounds). Tsunade got fucking ripped in half and survived with her seal, and Sakura is supposed to have surpassed her. On top of that, her seal is pretty much instant. Sage mode for Jiraiya is *not*.  He has to concentrate for a long time before he can enter it, and he\u2019s very vulnerable during that time. Does that mean he will lose? No. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that he would just outright win. I\u2019d put it at 7/10 wins for Jiraiya. \n\nNagato is stronger than Jiraiya, both with his paths and in his \u201chealed\u201d form that he has after absorbing some of the nine rails energy when he\u2019s reanimated. However, Jiraiya is too much of a direct counter to his abilities as Pain. Nagato in a healed, normal body form would stomp Jiraiya.",

Nagato took on Killer Bee and KCM Naruto at the same time. We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Tsunade didn't even come close to Madara, but she put up a decent fight with the other five Kage. Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

I do believe they have feelings for one another but it just seems really really forced. Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship.

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

So nobody is saying Sasuke is perfect.\n\nThe fact that most of their relationship isn't animated means that you can't really judge them. All we saw was 2-3 years and the rest of the 30+? Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke. Old Sasuke was embarrassed to even think about his past decisions. Naruto really changed him.",

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

We agree on this.\n\nFor the wins, I think we also agree, but for different reasons. Hundred healings is OP, no doubt. But it's a finite resource that Jiraiya knows well, considering Tsunade is his teammate. He knows he can wait out the clock or stall her. Like with sealing her in a toad stomach or using the Swamp Jutsu.\n\nIf Sakura lands a hit, it's basically over, I don't see Jiraiya surviving that outside of Sage Mode. He could maybe tank one with it active, but that might be a stretch. It's that *if* though. Sage Mode doesn't take that long to activate, going off of Manga showings(I never watched the anime, but I'm told they stretched that wait time out). When Jiraiya uses Sage Mode, he hides and he hides well. He can use Gamabunta and Ma and Pa for support to get it active and after that, I don't see Sakura landing a hit.\n\nJiraiya wins 7-8/10.",

Sakura in her prime is stronger than most Kages, it was clear in her fight against Shin that she\u2019s a lot stronger and more skilled than she was in the war.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

Like for YEARS DECADES, Sasukes all like: \u201cbegone thot\u201d and even Sakura attemps to KILL Sasuke because her friends dont like Sasuke and the shit he\u2019s been doing (understandable for them as not members of team 7) but to just try to throw away your feelings for the man you\u2019re so in love with, and betray narutos trust as a friend and teammate, is just fucked up and corny as hell. So i cannot agree that their relationship is healthy and stable after all the shit they\u2019ve done and put through one another and even had a child off such a toxic relationship. And for this is why I don\u2019t like or agree with Sakura or Sasuke and Sakuras relationship at all, but unfortunately its cannon so it is what it is.",

Before that Sasuke was a member of Team 7. Aside from those 2-3 years, Sakura and Sasuke have had at least 30 years to create a relationship. Keep in mind that almost none of it was animated, but it was there. So I don't see why those 2-3 years are a big deal",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

So nobody is saying Sasuke is perfect.\n\nThe fact that most of their relationship isn't animated means that you can't really judge them. All we saw was 2-3 years and the rest of the 30+? Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke. Old Sasuke was embarrassed to even think about his past decisions. Naruto really changed him.",

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Sakura in her prime is stronger than most Kages, it was clear in her fight against Shin that she\u2019s a lot stronger and more skilled than she was in the war. And as stated at the end of the war she was already stronger than Tsunade, therefore most likely stronger than the fourth Raikage and Mangekyou Sasuke.

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Tsunade didn't even come close to Madara, but she put up a decent fight with the other five Kage. Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke.

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

But you're not his wife or his daughter. If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

She is nowhere near the level of Kaguya or Sasuke or Naruto just because she dodged one attack. Naruto isn't anywhere near Kaguya's level of power either and he still managed to blitz her and go blow for blow by himself for a good while. Her dodging an attack isn't impressive.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the only reason Kaguya was even able to show up in the first place. Fucking Sakura. The only useful thing she does during the war is keep Naruto alive long enough to get 9 tails back, and summon Katsuyu.",

Sakura could do nothing against Pein when he showed up. She stood by and watched helplessly, despite the fact that she had Hundred Healings. Even if she activated it, based on feats from Tsunade(whom we will use to scale Sakura) she couldn't really do anything anyway. The Deva path was able to outspeed and over power *Sage Naruto*, who, need I remind you, could react to the THIRD Raikage. The Raikage that makes his successor look like a bitch.\n\nSaid Successor outclasses Tsunade in speed and reaction time, since 4th Raikage could outspeed MS Kage Summit Sasuke, who outspeeds Sakura who is relevant to Tsunade.\n\nBearing all of those On Panel facts in mind, I want to take you back to the Jiraiya vs Pein fight, where Pein fought in the Rain Village where hes strongest. Jiraiya took out three of the (admittedly weaker) paths of Pein and Nagato even said that he very well could have lost that fight.\n\nI've seen people claim that Sakura wouldn't allow him to activate Sage Mode cause it takes too long, but the Anime dragged that out. In the Manga it doesn't take quite so long and its not like Jiraiya is going to stand there in a field gathering energy. He also has Ma and Pa and fucking Gamabunta. Like, sure, Sakura has Kaysuyu, but he only needs Gama to distract them long enough to gather energy and after that Jiraiya uses his superior intellect, as shown in all his fights, his Ninjutsu to keep her at distance and his experience with Tsunades fighting style to keep his advantage.\n\nJiraiya wins against Shipuden Sakura low dif.",

I mean Nagato struggled with the 7-tails. Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Tsunade didn't even come close to Madara, but she put up a decent fight with the other five Kage. Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

Say what you will about the 30+ years of bullshitting, but their relationship is built on PURE toxicity, and the fact that those 30+ years arent animated/written about makes this even worse. This relationship was thrown together because the ending of naruto was rushed as fuck in the anime and the manga. Kishimoto did plan for them to end up together but they way he went about it makes it looked forced as fuck. Sasuke goes from village abandonment hurting Sakura, Constantly doing orochimarus biding: killing, stealing etc, for the sole sake of power, then MURDErs orochimaru then his brother, then kills multiple samurai, cuts the raikages arm off KILLS THE HOKAGE, then sees Sakura, tells her to commit murder for him, and the SECOND Sakura hesitates what does Sasuke do??? TRIES TO KILL HER...TWICE! If it weren\u2019t Kakashi AND Naruto, Sakura would be fucking dead in the water, and what Sasuke would\u2019ve said was: \u201cshe got in the way of my ambition, leaf scum\u201d- I believe he even says something along those lines to Naruto on that bridge scene. Then between that time and the war Sakuras pussy starts quenching for Sasuke again all of a sudden??? Thats so bullshit. Then AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, after Sasuke Literally threatened to enslave Konoha and KILL the current five kage -one of them being the woman that made sakura strong in the first place \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f- for the sake of his ambition. And what does Sakura do in that moment?? CRY. AGAIN. Then after naruto and Sasuke fight he goes: \u201cI\u2019m sowwy\ud83e\udd7a\u201d and ALL IS FORGIVEN FOR SAKURA?? Thats total and complete BULLSHIT. Until i see or read something that demonstrates that there genuine and true love that justifies them being together, this relationship is fucking toxic. Idc if i have 30 years with a killer im hot giving her my dick and letting her have my seed, tf i look like doing that?? Shits illogical as fuck.",

So nobody is saying Sasuke is perfect.\n\nThe fact that most of their relationship isn't animated means that you can't really judge them. All we saw was 2-3 years and the rest of the 30+? Just act like they don't exist? Come on man. Im sorry if its hard for you to accept but all of that is in the past now. Sasuke has already done plenty of work using his power to save lifes, and protect all the villages and I think that deserves some respect. \n\nI used to be like you, I always hated Sasuke, but he really turned into a better person in Boruto. He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke.

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Her dodging an attack isn't impressive.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the only reason Kaguya was even able to show up in the first place. Fucking Sakura.

Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

So considering she\u2019s both stronger and has top tier healing + summonings that would make them about equal.                       Why would you use pain arc Sakura? That\u2019s far from her prime. Kishimoto probably hadn\u2019t even considered giving her 100 sealings at the time, and might not have even considered making Tsunade as strong as she became. Either way Sakura was far away from her prime at that time. Even if a short amount of time passad, pretty much everyone got a lot stronger during that time, even Kakashi got incredibly strong in that span of time. Tsunade could do nothing at the time since she used up all her chakra to heal the village, so not exactly applicable. Nagato did say that he might have lost, sure. But that goes for a lot of people, doesn\u2019t really say much about Jiraiya\u2019s strength, his sage mode form is weaker than Naruto\u2019s is. I don\u2019t see how Jiraiya would low diff Tsunade, so the same should go for Sakura that most likely surpassed her in her war arc prime (and especially in \u201dthe last\u201d/Boruto prime). The only reason Jiraiya even took out the first paths was due to the frog genjutsu, not his own strength. So that all relies on him being able to enter sage mode and get the time to have them use it, it\u2019s not like ma and pa can be used to distract her, since they\u2019re included in summon. The sage mode transition may not be as slow as in the anime, but it still takes quite a bit of time, and as said the genjutsu can\u2019t just be thrown out easily either. The toads may not even be as big of a threat as one might think. Tsunade was strong enough to punch a hole through a fully formed susanoo, and I doubt any of the toads would be more durable than that, and Jiraiya probably doesn\u2019t have the chakra to summon several toads at once. With the assistance of Katsuya Gamabunta probably wouldn\u2019t ve able to buy that much time at all.                                                  What jutsu could Jiraiya even use to being her down? She could easily tank pretty much all of his jutsu in 100 healings mode, and a single punch would knock him out.",

Pein and Madara do not come close, so I brought up Madara because she actually made something of a contribution in that fight where as she didn't with Pein at all. Which is why I'm arguing the fourteen day difference is just as Kishi plothole and not actually representative of the fact that the characters didn't grow stronger in that time frame.\n\nSakura was significantly stronger in Fourth great war than she was during Pein arc. You using Peins opinion on Jiraiyas strength and extrapolating to Sakura vs Jiraiya is stupid. Like I said twice now, I don't even think Sakura could take Jiraiya. I brought up a devils advocate thing since so many people pretend she's literally worthless in a fight when Kishi objectively made her one of the top 5 strongest shinobi still alive. You seem to be treating this as if I'm being some unreasonable lunatic about it when you are the one arguing that it's not even a shadow of a chance in hell that she can take Jiraiya\n\nBut like you said, you do you man.",

He actually cares what his wife and daughter think of him and doesn't look down on people who are not as strong as him anymore. And he truly regrets hurting all the people he did. \n\nI remember in the time travel episode when Sasuke met young Naruto again, and young Naruto of course could talk about young Sasuke.

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

Im not even saying to show all 30 years, if they just dedicated an episode or two when Sasuke comes to terms with these feelings and reciprocates them then I\u2019d accept it and move on and respect their relationship. I dont hate Sasuke either, quite the contrary; he did some wild ass shit but thats what makes his character better for me. Its just super wild to me that they ended up together, in all fairness, i feel like he\u2019s better alone, since even on his time off he spends his time alone anyways and away from his family. Sasuke is not built to be a family man, and their relationship according to the manga/ anime/ novels, do not make their relationship justified in any way. But you\u2019re right, maybe they just moved on, but that just seems absolutely ridiculous to move on from the things he did in the span of thirty years. Thirty years may seem long, but in comparison with his crimes, thirty years is nothing to me. I can only imagine how much guilt he feels just having a family now. Sure he cares what people think n all, but he\u2019s not present in Sarada\u2019s life as much as he should be. Even in Boruto when Sasuke leaving after the sarada arc, Sakura literally says \u201cjust a rain check\u201d Sasuke often neglects his responsibility as a husband and a Father, which just adds so much more to the toxicity of their family dynamic. I get that his jobs important and he\u2019s the only one able to do it but got damn man. I just dont see how this relationship is in any way stable from start to finish.",

If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

If they feel like they love him and he loves them, why should you have a problem with that? I didn't like who Sasuke was either but he's a different person, and has been a different, better person for a lot longer than he has when he was still in the darkness.\n\nAnd yea he doesn't spend as much time with his family as others do, but thats because he does have a job, a very important job that both Sakura and Sarada also have, to a lesser degree. Naruto can't spend as much time with his family either. Its not fair to his family, but its the sacrifice that they have to make because someone has to do his job. I mean hell, Sasuke is literally the second most powerful person on the planet? And its not like he's even old yet, he's still relatively young. It's a shame he can't be with his family more, but it'd also be a shame to settle down and retire while the Otsusuki and the Kara still need to be stopped. Its just the world they live in. \n\nI think maybe you should take some time and think about how you see things. These people are heros that save lives and I feel maybe you're too quick to judge them. Yes, Sasuke too, he's been saving lives for a lot longer than he's been ending them. If you lived in the Leaf, he'd be there to protect you too.\n\nNo one is perfect, they just do the best with what they were given. I think they're doing well all things considered.",

Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

Naruto has the full nine tails + plus six paths mode. Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",

Seeing how sage nine tails Naruto was at HasHiramas, level if not weaker and obito was stronger than him and Madara was stronger than him and then madara also got another finnegan just to get slapped by six paths Naruto should show just how big of a buff six paths is. It was only after he absorbed the divine tree he stood a chance. Now add Sasuke who is at Naruto level and put him with naruto against Kaguya. And Sakura somehow dodges a attack. Sage naruto was at Jiraiya level and he only beat pain with help of the nine tails. Sakura is far stronger.",
