Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Cause Naruto's base(Non kurama) chakra is 100x of Kakashi, boruto 's cannot be so less. Right now boruto can't use as much chakra due to the karma, but realistically, if he had been in Naruto time, he, for obvious reasons won't have it, so he won't have the chakra problem.",

And yeah if he was born in narutos time realistically boruto was much smarter at a younger age he would have understood stuff, I think he would have been driven to suicide in all honesty, boruto does not have as much faith in humanity as naruto",

Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Mans stupidly runs after Kage level aliens, if not for plot he would be dead. \n3. Mans expects the his dad the hokage and the leader of the village to leave his duties and come to a birthday party. \nEtc etc etc \nP.S the reason he wouldn\u2019t survive in narutos world is because he has naruto\u2019s personality without naruto\u2019s greatest plot armor, kurama or the 9 tails.",

Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Cause Naruto's base(Non kurama) chakra is 100x of Kakashi, boruto 's cannot be so less. Right now boruto can't use as much chakra due to the karma, but realistically, if he had been in Naruto time, he, for obvious reasons won't have it, so he won't have the chakra problem.",

Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Boruto hasn't made a full sized rasengan while Naruto made a full sized. Naruto could make a 1000 shadow clones without the help of kurama, while boruto can't, he should be able to cause he is an Uzumaki ( they have huge chakra reserves)\n\nAnd lastly, while boruto is pretty decent at battle tactics( around 2nd or 3rd in his gen), Naruto was far better at his age. Remember his plans to distract zabuza and his way to catch kakuzo off guard. Naruto wins in battle tactics",

Right now boruto can't use as much chakra due to the karma, but realistically, if he had been in Naruto time, he, for obvious reasons won't have it, so he won't have the chakra problem.",
