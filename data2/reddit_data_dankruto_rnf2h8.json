He burned the hellscape before him into his retinas so that he would never forget it. A warmth unlike that of his tears wriggled and squirmed within his eyes. The sensation\u2014a wild wave of power flowing toward his retinas\u2014was so terrifying, he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he did, the wave slowly, quietly disappeared into the center of his head. His heart pounded madly, and his breathing was ragged. He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes. Before him, the hellish world was unchanged. He gently pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like if he gave himself over to that power, he would stop being himself somehow.\n\n**Age 5 - Page 27:** In the core of his brain, Itachi heard an ear-splitting screeching. They hadn't actually run that far, and yet he was having trouble breathing. Overlaid on the scene before his eyes was the battlefield he had seen when he was four. War ...A dull pain raced deep into his eyes. Just like that moment on the battlefield, waves of power pulsed behind his eyeballs. He felt like the world was dyed crimson for a moment, but the sensation quickly subsided. \u201cItachi?\u201d his mother called to him from behind, having noticed something strange in her son.\n\n**Age 8 - Page 79-80:** Itachi clutched the blankets even more tightly, as if he could use them to escape the sound of his father\u2019s voice.\u201cNnngh!\u201d Emotions he couldn\u2019t suppress became a groan of anguish, and forced their way out of him. His body shivered and shook. He wasn\u2019t shaking because he was afraid. Anger at his own useless self rocked his body. A sense of helplessness, defeat, emptiness, disappointment. He shook with these waves of emotion, turned inward to race through his body. He wanted power. He didn\u2019t have enough power to protect his teammates. Nor enough to put his father\u2019s mind at ease. More, more ...He would go beyond even that masked man. No, he would have the power to go beyond anyone and everyone in this world. And then, he would grab onto the root of all fighting with his own hands. He felt something hot beneath his tightly closed eyelids. Not tears. Something hotter than that.Throb.He felt a pounding at the nape of his neck, and then something hot like fire shot through his body and concentrated around the pounding, before pouring into his eyes. Itachi finally realized that the source of this blazing power was chakra. Those born into the Uchiha clan were cloaked in a chakra with fire attributes. But he had never before in his life experienced this kind of heat from his chakra. Still, he managed to coolly assess what was occurring within his own body. Eyes still closed, he pushed the blankets off and sat up in his futon, before gradually opening his eyes. Awakening ...\n\n**Page 47: Page 47-48:** \u201cWhen I get mad, I get those eyes without even knowing it. \u201dHow did you activate it?\u201d Itachi still hadn\u2019t activated the Sharingan. Apparently, the trigger was in the heart somehow, but even Shisui wouldn\u2019t teach him about it. Given that he had gone beyond the average ninja to master basically every skill, the fact that he hadn\u2019t awakened the Sharingan was a hard truth to bear.\n\n**There are very clearly two pseudo-awakenings or short-lived awakenings of Itachi's Sharingan during his experience of the battlefield at 4 and the Nine-Tails Attack at 5. He did not fully awaken it, as he lacked the necessary surge of emotions combined with a strong enough desire for greater power (IMO), but he briefly activated the Sharingan on both occasions.**\n\n**Izumi is a prime example of subconsciously activating the Sharingan without having control over it.**\n\n**The important distinction, in my opinion, is that the Itachi himself makes a concerted effort to push down the Sharingan at the age of 4, rather than embracing it - Thus, it goes away without fully awakening. I believe his intuition to push back the Sharingan's power or else it would consume him relates to the Uchiha Curse of Hatred (Naruto Ch 619), which Itachi never suffered from, even after awakening his Mangekyo. Therefore, I believe this very action based on instinct is the reason Itachi never suffered from the curse like Madara, Obito or Sasuke did (Shisui's obviously Shisui).**\n\n**In conclusion, Itachi awakens it briefly at age 4, before he suppresses it and shuts it off; he activates it again at age 5 before its power subsides; he finally awakens it fully at age 8.**",

Hashirama knew this, Madara knew this, and we know this but the rest of the world do not. If anything this would just trigger their paranoia and see hostile intent where there is none. That's why they had to approach this in a more discrete manner. \n\n>And the power of the Senju doesn't wane just by not taking the name, they could still forcibly take control of their affairs.\n\nExactly, that's why I mention it not looking like subjugation. Perception is also important in political matters. \n\n\n>Why would they even try to marry those clans if those suspicions were a thing?\n\nThe goal is to form a peaceful and cooperative existence with the other clans. This method could break away those suspicions.\n\n>Why not simply marry to each clan... Like every single clan did?\n\nDid you mean marry within the clan like the Hyuga and the Uchiha clan did/do? I'm sure not everyone married outside the clan. Only those who are willing to join another clan probably did.\n\n>Not really? Mito Uzumaki married Hashirama and the Senju didn't subjugated the Uzumaki clan in any way. Besides that this thing will obviously ceased to exist once the village was formed.\n\nBut, Hashirama is not* marrying Mito to conquer that's the difference. It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

The way we use last names now is a recent invention to make it easier to collect taxes. I wouldn't apply how we use last names today as a standard especially towards fantasy worlds. There is a custom in Japanese culture that started all the way back in the 13th century or even further where someone outside of the clan can be adopted and become part of that clan. Sometimes it was done by marrying one of the daughters from the clan but, if there aren't any daughters,  the patriarch can just adopt whoever they feel is qualified. The adopted man will have to take the clan name going forward. An example of this would be [Osamu Suzuki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Suzuki_(businessman)), the former CEO of the Suzuki Motor Corporation. He married into the Suzuki family and ditched his last name in favor of his wife, Shoko Suzuki. So, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of a man taking on the name of his wife's family.",

It's definitely not a thing nowadays, but they don't have nobility anymore.\n\nAs the other guy said, in the case of nobility the women would not lose their noble name for a commoner one. They would either marry into another noble family or the noble family would adopt an exceptional commoner into the family first. This would be particularly important when your descendants inherit superhuman abilities. \n\nThe Akamichi, Hyuuga, Aburame, and Uchiha (and Uzumaki though they're a broken and foreign family) are nobles.

Also I did mention that some of them must have died in battle during the three great Ninja wars, it's not like everyone became a farmer as soon as they settled down in Konoha. But a portion of them must have taken regular jobs. \n\nAs for the latter part, it was a joke. Not a Tobirama fan...I suppose?",

With the creation of the village, and no special characteristics other than the will of fire to give to their ascendants for the most part, there was no longer a need to really put the clan front and and centre but instead focus on uniting. This also fits much more with the Senju and the Naruto part of the Sage son soul thingies.\n\nIt makes sense to me that specifically the Senju fade into non existence, having spread themselves and united everyone, while the Uchiha, descendants of the other son are much more focused on remaining a segregated group. It all lies in the different philosophies of their founders.\n\nI do think there is a world building problem with the extreme lack of the Senju clan in the time of Naruto and Boruto, but it doesn't surprise me they are far less visible than the Uchiha. What you'd likely expect is ninja from Konoha to be stronger in general due to the chakra of the Senju they inherited but otherwise it makes sense to me.",

Keep in mind that they're a founding clan of the village while others like the Sarutobis joined after the village was founded. \n\nPeople opposing Minato like Danzo actually supported Orochimaru becoming Fourth Hokage instead. \n\n>Both Fugaku and Itachi, the people who know his strength best, are both embarrassed by them saying it because of how ridiculous it was.\n\nExcept they were equally ranked by Konoha. The issue about becoming Hokage isn't just about power. It's also about leadership and experience. This was why during the Chunin exams only Shikamaru became a Chunin because of his leadership and tactical abilities.\n\nAs for Fugaku, we don't really see his actual strength  in terms of feats, but from what's implied from the anime adaptation, he was at least powerful enough to wield as much control over Kurama as Obito did with his Mangekyo.\n\nHeck we don't even know what his true power of his Mangekyo Sharingan was, without knowing that its pretty much impossible to rate him either as lower than anyone on that list. \n\nConsidering how the Mangekyo can only be used sparingly, and how Shisui had the Susano'o, it's also theoretically possible that Fugaku may have at least been able to manifest an incomplete Susano'o.\n\nAs for Itachi, he literally stated himself that he didn't want to face his father on the battlefield because he didn't want to fight his father, and because he knew his strength. \n\nAs for Sasuke, he's been trained by Orochimaru in addition to being given other additional enhancements, so he has that feat going for him.",

Like, arguably, Fugaku would need to be able to solo the village to reach status as Minato\u2019s equal, which nobody in their right mind suggests. \n\nFugaku wasn\u2019t snubbed because he was an Uchiha. He was snubbed because the other candidates were stronger than him, smarter than him, and more charismatic than him. Simple as that. \n\nThere is nothing to indicate that Fugaku had a Susano\u2019o. Just the opposite actually, seeing as the plan revolves around using Kurama as a weapon and the fact that Fugaku had his vision, when Sasuke pretty much lost his vision completely from a single afternoon of using Susano\u2019o. We have no reason to think his Mangekyo is that strong.\n\nCertainly nothing on the level of fucking Obito, who was controlling a Perfect Jinchuuriki and their Bijuu simultaneously while on other sides of the continent doing his shit and who was able to control Kurama using a Base Sharingan. Lol. Imagine unironically comparing Foddergaku\u2019d Sharingan to Obito\u2019s, who has by far the most ridiculously powerful Sharingan in the series outside of Sasuke\u2019s RinneSharingan.\n\nYou can\u2019t use theoretical shit and \u201cBut We DoN\u2019T KnOW HoW StROng.\u201d To argue a point like this.\n\nFact is, everybody, Danzo, Hiruzen, Itachi, the Elders, absolutely everybody agreed that if Hiruzen had to fight the Uchiha, he would win. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if Fugaku was even close to being on Minato\u2019s level. Hell, the fact that Shisui and Kurama were even involved in the plan to begin with tells you more than enough",

It also to show that he willing to work with Uchiha clan by doing this so that they won't feel bad about Madara not being chosen as hokage. In a way, hashirama is representing the senju clan but since he took hokage, he don't want to do that as if it isolating them from everyone else like the hyuga and Uchiha that still around because they stick close while senju clan is off doing their thing. Orrr the senju just died out in the war, remember there were 3 great wars, but it impossible that all of them would almost died out, so for the plot of the story, senju clan existence wasn't really told much because they wanna start the Uchiha v senju again in the village since there was nearly a coup during 3rd hokage reign, and if senju clan still exist and hanging out together like the Uchiha, there could be rivalry going along and hashirama prob don't want to do that. He probably took the approach to dissolved for the sake of making peace with Uchiha knowing their bloody history with each other. Uchiha and hyuga was at it at that point but not as much with the senju v Uchiha.",

He burned the hellscape before him into his retinas so that he would never forget it. A warmth unlike that of his tears wriggled and squirmed within his eyes. The sensation\u2014a wild wave of power flowing toward his retinas\u2014was so terrifying, he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he did, the wave slowly, quietly disappeared into the center of his head. His heart pounded madly, and his breathing was ragged. He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes. Before him, the hellish world was unchanged. He gently pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like if he gave himself over to that power, he would stop being himself somehow.\n\n**Age 5 - Page 27:** In the core of his brain, Itachi heard an ear-splitting screeching. They hadn't actually run that far, and yet he was having trouble breathing. Overlaid on the scene before his eyes was the battlefield he had seen when he was four. War ...A dull pain raced deep into his eyes. Just like that moment on the battlefield, waves of power pulsed behind his eyeballs. He felt like the world was dyed crimson for a moment, but the sensation quickly subsided. \u201cItachi?\u201d his mother called to him from behind, having noticed something strange in her son.\n\n**Age 8 - Page 79-80:** Itachi clutched the blankets even more tightly, as if he could use them to escape the sound of his father\u2019s voice.\u201cNnngh!\u201d Emotions he couldn\u2019t suppress became a groan of anguish, and forced their way out of him. His body shivered and shook. He wasn\u2019t shaking because he was afraid. Anger at his own useless self rocked his body. A sense of helplessness, defeat, emptiness, disappointment. He shook with these waves of emotion, turned inward to race through his body. He wanted power. He didn\u2019t have enough power to protect his teammates. Nor enough to put his father\u2019s mind at ease. More, more ...He would go beyond even that masked man. No, he would have the power to go beyond anyone and everyone in this world. And then, he would grab onto the root of all fighting with his own hands. He felt something hot beneath his tightly closed eyelids. Not tears. Something hotter than that.Throb.He felt a pounding at the nape of his neck, and then something hot like fire shot through his body and concentrated around the pounding, before pouring into his eyes. Itachi finally realized that the source of this blazing power was chakra. Those born into the Uchiha clan were cloaked in a chakra with fire attributes. But he had never before in his life experienced this kind of heat from his chakra. Still, he managed to coolly assess what was occurring within his own body. Eyes still closed, he pushed the blankets off and sat up in his futon, before gradually opening his eyes. Awakening ...\n\n**Page 47: Page 47-48:** \u201cWhen I get mad, I get those eyes without even knowing it. \u201dHow did you activate it?\u201d Itachi still hadn\u2019t activated the Sharingan. Apparently, the trigger was in the heart somehow, but even Shisui wouldn\u2019t teach him about it. Given that he had gone beyond the average ninja to master basically every skill, the fact that he hadn\u2019t awakened the Sharingan was a hard truth to bear.\n\n**There are very clearly two pseudo-awakenings or short-lived awakenings of Itachi's Sharingan during his experience of the battlefield at 4 and the Nine-Tails Attack at 5. He did not fully awaken it, as he lacked the necessary surge of emotions combined with a strong enough desire for greater power (IMO), but he briefly activated the Sharingan on both occasions.**\n\n**Izumi is a prime example of subconsciously activating the Sharingan without having control over it.**\n\n**The important distinction, in my opinion, is that the Itachi himself makes a concerted effort to push down the Sharingan at the age of 4, rather than embracing it - Thus, it goes away without fully awakening. I believe his intuition to push back the Sharingan's power or else it would consume him relates to the Uchiha Curse of Hatred (Naruto Ch 619), which Itachi never suffered from, even after awakening his Mangekyo. Therefore, I believe this very action based on instinct is the reason Itachi never suffered from the curse like Madara, Obito or Sasuke did (Shisui's obviously Shisui).**\n\n**In conclusion, Itachi awakens it briefly at age 4, before he suppresses it and shuts it off; he activates it again at age 5 before its power subsides; he finally awakens it fully at age 8.**",

Mito Uzumaki married Hashirama and the Senju didn't subjugated the Uzumaki clan in any way. Besides that this thing will obviously ceased to exist once the village was formed.\n\nBut, Hashirama is not* marrying Mito to conquer that's the difference. It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

I wouldn't apply how we use last names today as a standard especially towards fantasy worlds. There is a custom in Japanese culture that started all the way back in the 13th century or even further where someone outside of the clan can be adopted and become part of that clan. Sometimes it was done by marrying one of the daughters from the clan but, if there aren't any daughters,  the patriarch can just adopt whoever they feel is qualified. The adopted man will have to take the clan name going forward. An example of this would be [Osamu Suzuki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Suzuki_(businessman)), the former CEO of the Suzuki Motor Corporation. He married into the Suzuki family and ditched his last name in favor of his wife, Shoko Suzuki. So, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of a man taking on the name of his wife's family.",

The nine tales was also too powerful to seal in a infant, so it's also possible Orochimaru assumed they sealed it in someone that could handle it (he also wouldn't know that Minato split the nine tales in 2).",

They would either marry into another noble family or the noble family would adopt an exceptional commoner into the family first. This would be particularly important when your descendants inherit superhuman abilities. \n\nThe Akamichi, Hyuuga, Aburame, and Uchiha (and Uzumaki though they're a broken and foreign family) are nobles.

Keep in mind that they're a founding clan of the village while others like the Sarutobis joined after the village was founded. \n\nPeople opposing Minato like Danzo actually supported Orochimaru becoming Fourth Hokage instead. \n\n>Both Fugaku and Itachi, the people who know his strength best, are both embarrassed by them saying it because of how ridiculous it was.\n\nExcept they were equally ranked by Konoha. The issue about becoming Hokage isn't just about power. It's also about leadership and experience. This was why during the Chunin exams only Shikamaru became a Chunin because of his leadership and tactical abilities.\n\nAs for Fugaku, we don't really see his actual strength  in terms of feats, but from what's implied from the anime adaptation, he was at least powerful enough to wield as much control over Kurama as Obito did with his Mangekyo.\n\nHeck we don't even know what his true power of his Mangekyo Sharingan was, without knowing that its pretty much impossible to rate him either as lower than anyone on that list. \n\nConsidering how the Mangekyo can only be used sparingly, and how Shisui had the Susano'o, it's also theoretically possible that Fugaku may have at least been able to manifest an incomplete Susano'o.\n\nAs for Itachi, he literally stated himself that he didn't want to face his father on the battlefield because he didn't want to fight his father, and because he knew his strength. \n\nAs for Sasuke, he's been trained by Orochimaru in addition to being given other additional enhancements, so he has that feat going for him.",

This puts him well and truly below pretty much any major player in Shippuden, and given Minato\u2019s later feats, for Fugaku to be on his level requires some crazy nonsense. Like, arguably, Fugaku would need to be able to solo the village to reach status as Minato\u2019s equal, which nobody in their right mind suggests. \n\nFugaku wasn\u2019t snubbed because he was an Uchiha. He was snubbed because the other candidates were stronger than him, smarter than him, and more charismatic than him. Simple as that. \n\nThere is nothing to indicate that Fugaku had a Susano\u2019o. Just the opposite actually, seeing as the plan revolves around using Kurama as a weapon and the fact that Fugaku had his vision, when Sasuke pretty much lost his vision completely from a single afternoon of using Susano\u2019o. We have no reason to think his Mangekyo is that strong.\n\nCertainly nothing on the level of fucking Obito, who was controlling a Perfect Jinchuuriki and their Bijuu simultaneously while on other sides of the continent doing his shit and who was able to control Kurama using a Base Sharingan. Lol. Imagine unironically comparing Foddergaku\u2019d Sharingan to Obito\u2019s, who has by far the most ridiculously powerful Sharingan in the series outside of Sasuke\u2019s RinneSharingan.\n\nYou can\u2019t use theoretical shit and \u201cBut We DoN\u2019T KnOW HoW StROng.\u201d To argue a point like this.\n\nFact is, everybody, Danzo, Hiruzen, Itachi, the Elders, absolutely everybody agreed that if Hiruzen had to fight the Uchiha, he would win. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if Fugaku was even close to being on Minato\u2019s level. Hell, the fact that Shisui and Kurama were even involved in the plan to begin with tells you more than enough",

                                    "body": "**Excerpts from the Itachi Daylight novel.**  \n\n\n**Age 4 - Page 14:** His father\u2019s voice led Itachi to rub his eyes. He burned the hellscape before him into his retinas so that he would never forget it. A warmth unlike that of his tears wriggled and squirmed within his eyes. The sensation\u2014a wild wave of power flowing toward his retinas\u2014was so terrifying, he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he did, the wave slowly, quietly disappeared into the center of his head. His heart pounded madly, and his breathing was ragged. He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes. Before him, the hellish world was unchanged. He gently pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like if he gave himself over to that power, he would stop being himself somehow.\n\n**Age 5 - Page 27:** In the core of his brain, Itachi heard an ear-splitting screeching. They hadn't actually run that far, and yet he was having trouble breathing. Overlaid on the scene before his eyes was the battlefield he had seen when he was four. War ...A dull pain raced deep into his eyes. Just like that moment on the battlefield, waves of power pulsed behind his eyeballs. He felt like the world was dyed crimson for a moment, but the sensation quickly subsided. \u201cItachi?\u201d his mother called to him from behind, having noticed something strange in her son.\n\n**Age 8 - Page 79-80:** Itachi clutched the blankets even more tightly, as if he could use them to escape the sound of his father\u2019s voice.\u201cNnngh!\u201d Emotions he couldn\u2019t suppress became a groan of anguish, and forced their way out of him. His body shivered and shook. He wasn\u2019t shaking because he was afraid. Anger at his own useless self rocked his body. A sense of helplessness, defeat, emptiness, disappointment. He shook with these waves of emotion, turned inward to race through his body. He wanted power. He didn\u2019t have enough power to protect his teammates. Nor enough to put his father\u2019s mind at ease. More, more ...He would go beyond even that masked man. No, he would have the power to go beyond anyone and everyone in this world. And then, he would grab onto the root of all fighting with his own hands. He felt something hot beneath his tightly closed eyelids. Not tears. Something hotter than that.Throb.He felt a pounding at the nape of his neck, and then something hot like fire shot through his body and concentrated around the pounding, before pouring into his eyes. Itachi finally realized that the source of this blazing power was chakra. Those born into the Uchiha clan were cloaked in a chakra with fire attributes. But he had never before in his life experienced this kind of heat from his chakra. Still, he managed to coolly assess what was occurring within his own body. Eyes still closed, he pushed the blankets off and sat up in his futon, before gradually opening his eyes. Awakening ...\n\n**Page 47: Page 47-48:** \u201cWhen I get mad, I get those eyes without even knowing it. \u201dHow did you activate it?\u201d Itachi still hadn\u2019t activated the Sharingan. Apparently, the trigger was in the heart somehow, but even Shisui wouldn\u2019t teach him about it. Given that he had gone beyond the average ninja to master basically every skill, the fact that he hadn\u2019t awakened the Sharingan was a hard truth to bear.\n\n**There are very clearly two pseudo-awakenings or short-lived awakenings of Itachi's Sharingan during his experience of the battlefield at 4 and the Nine-Tails Attack at 5. He did not fully awaken it, as he lacked the necessary surge of emotions combined with a strong enough desire for greater power (IMO), but he briefly activated the Sharingan on both occasions.**\n\n**Izumi is a prime example of subconsciously activating the Sharingan without having control over it.**\n\n**The important distinction, in my opinion, is that the Itachi himself makes a concerted effort to push down the Sharingan at the age of 4, rather than embracing it - Thus, it goes away without fully awakening. I believe his intuition to push back the Sharingan's power or else it would consume him relates to the Uchiha Curse of Hatred (Naruto Ch 619), which Itachi never suffered from, even after awakening his Mangekyo. Therefore, I believe this very action based on instinct is the reason Itachi never suffered from the curse like Madara, Obito or Sasuke did (Shisui's obviously Shisui).**\n\n**In conclusion, Itachi awakens it briefly at age 4, before he suppresses it and shuts it off; he activates it again at age 5 before its power subsides; he finally awakens it fully at age 8.**",

A clearly superior clan securing a marriage alliance with a less powerful clan would often bring that clan under the influence of the former rather than vice versa. So, if the Senju surrendered their names in favor of the clan they're marrying into, it wouldn't look like they are coming in to take control of their affairs. \n\n>Why would they think they were conquering them?\n\nIt was back in the days where clans fought other clans for supremacy. One way to conquer in feudal society is by marriage. A powerful clan like the Senju suddenly securing marriage ties with various could be seen as conquest.\n\n>It's not Hashirama's decision to make tho. Hashirama doesn't own the Senju clan. And lol, Hashirama himself didn't do that. His kids and grandkids all wear his name.\n\nHe's the head and the most influential member of the Senju clan. He managed to convince his clan to ally with their rival clan who they fought against for generations. To say he doesn't have sway over his people is just foolish. Hashirama doesn't have to do it since he's the patriarch of the clan. Anyone outside of his direct line can join other clans.\n\nThis is just a theory explaining how the Senju name vanished based on my knowledge of feudal societies which that time period of Naruto is more likely to be based. The members of the Senju clan could've just decided to ditch the name and create a new one for themselves.",

A clearly superior clan securing a marriage alliance with a less powerful clan would often bring that clan under the influence of the former rather than vice versa.

Mito Uzumaki married Hashirama and the Senju didn't subjugated the Uzumaki clan in any way. Besides that this thing will obviously ceased to exist once the village was formed.\n\nBut, Hashirama is not* marrying Mito to conquer that's the difference. It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

I wouldn't apply how we use last names today as a standard especially towards fantasy worlds. There is a custom in Japanese culture that started all the way back in the 13th century or even further where someone outside of the clan can be adopted and become part of that clan. Sometimes it was done by marrying one of the daughters from the clan but, if there aren't any daughters,  the patriarch can just adopt whoever they feel is qualified. The adopted man will have to take the clan name going forward. An example of this would be [Osamu Suzuki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Suzuki_(businessman)), the former CEO of the Suzuki Motor Corporation. He married into the Suzuki family and ditched his last name in favor of his wife, Shoko Suzuki. So, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of a man taking on the name of his wife's family.",

Keep in mind that they're a founding clan of the village while others like the Sarutobis joined after the village was founded. \n\nPeople opposing Minato like Danzo actually supported Orochimaru becoming Fourth Hokage instead. \n\n>Both Fugaku and Itachi, the people who know his strength best, are both embarrassed by them saying it because of how ridiculous it was.\n\nExcept they were equally ranked by Konoha. The issue about becoming Hokage isn't just about power. It's also about leadership and experience. This was why during the Chunin exams only Shikamaru became a Chunin because of his leadership and tactical abilities.\n\nAs for Fugaku, we don't really see his actual strength  in terms of feats, but from what's implied from the anime adaptation, he was at least powerful enough to wield as much control over Kurama as Obito did with his Mangekyo.\n\nHeck we don't even know what his true power of his Mangekyo Sharingan was, without knowing that its pretty much impossible to rate him either as lower than anyone on that list. \n\nConsidering how the Mangekyo can only be used sparingly, and how Shisui had the Susano'o, it's also theoretically possible that Fugaku may have at least been able to manifest an incomplete Susano'o.\n\nAs for Itachi, he literally stated himself that he didn't want to face his father on the battlefield because he didn't want to fight his father, and because he knew his strength. \n\nAs for Sasuke, he's been trained by Orochimaru in addition to being given other additional enhancements, so he has that feat going for him.",

This puts him well and truly below pretty much any major player in Shippuden, and given Minato\u2019s later feats, for Fugaku to be on his level requires some crazy nonsense. Like, arguably, Fugaku would need to be able to solo the village to reach status as Minato\u2019s equal, which nobody in their right mind suggests. \n\nFugaku wasn\u2019t snubbed because he was an Uchiha. He was snubbed because the other candidates were stronger than him, smarter than him, and more charismatic than him. Simple as that. \n\nThere is nothing to indicate that Fugaku had a Susano\u2019o. Just the opposite actually, seeing as the plan revolves around using Kurama as a weapon and the fact that Fugaku had his vision, when Sasuke pretty much lost his vision completely from a single afternoon of using Susano\u2019o. We have no reason to think his Mangekyo is that strong.\n\nCertainly nothing on the level of fucking Obito, who was controlling a Perfect Jinchuuriki and their Bijuu simultaneously while on other sides of the continent doing his shit and who was able to control Kurama using a Base Sharingan. Lol. Imagine unironically comparing Foddergaku\u2019d Sharingan to Obito\u2019s, who has by far the most ridiculously powerful Sharingan in the series outside of Sasuke\u2019s RinneSharingan.\n\nYou can\u2019t use theoretical shit and \u201cBut We DoN\u2019T KnOW HoW StROng.\u201d To argue a point like this.\n\nFact is, everybody, Danzo, Hiruzen, Itachi, the Elders, absolutely everybody agreed that if Hiruzen had to fight the Uchiha, he would win. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if Fugaku was even close to being on Minato\u2019s level. Hell, the fact that Shisui and Kurama were even involved in the plan to begin with tells you more than enough",

                            "body": "**Excerpts from the Itachi Daylight novel.**  \n\n\n**Age 4 - Page 14:** His father\u2019s voice led Itachi to rub his eyes. He burned the hellscape before him into his retinas so that he would never forget it. A warmth unlike that of his tears wriggled and squirmed within his eyes. The sensation\u2014a wild wave of power flowing toward his retinas\u2014was so terrifying, he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he did, the wave slowly, quietly disappeared into the center of his head. His heart pounded madly, and his breathing was ragged. He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes. Before him, the hellish world was unchanged. He gently pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like if he gave himself over to that power, he would stop being himself somehow.\n\n**Age 5 - Page 27:** In the core of his brain, Itachi heard an ear-splitting screeching. They hadn't actually run that far, and yet he was having trouble breathing. Overlaid on the scene before his eyes was the battlefield he had seen when he was four. War ...A dull pain raced deep into his eyes. Just like that moment on the battlefield, waves of power pulsed behind his eyeballs. He felt like the world was dyed crimson for a moment, but the sensation quickly subsided. \u201cItachi?\u201d his mother called to him from behind, having noticed something strange in her son.\n\n**Age 8 - Page 79-80:** Itachi clutched the blankets even more tightly, as if he could use them to escape the sound of his father\u2019s voice.\u201cNnngh!\u201d Emotions he couldn\u2019t suppress became a groan of anguish, and forced their way out of him. His body shivered and shook. He wasn\u2019t shaking because he was afraid. Anger at his own useless self rocked his body. A sense of helplessness, defeat, emptiness, disappointment. He shook with these waves of emotion, turned inward to race through his body. He wanted power. He didn\u2019t have enough power to protect his teammates. Nor enough to put his father\u2019s mind at ease. More, more ...He would go beyond even that masked man. No, he would have the power to go beyond anyone and everyone in this world. And then, he would grab onto the root of all fighting with his own hands. He felt something hot beneath his tightly closed eyelids. Not tears. Something hotter than that.Throb.He felt a pounding at the nape of his neck, and then something hot like fire shot through his body and concentrated around the pounding, before pouring into his eyes. Itachi finally realized that the source of this blazing power was chakra. Those born into the Uchiha clan were cloaked in a chakra with fire attributes. But he had never before in his life experienced this kind of heat from his chakra. Still, he managed to coolly assess what was occurring within his own body. Eyes still closed, he pushed the blankets off and sat up in his futon, before gradually opening his eyes. Awakening ...\n\n**Page 47: Page 47-48:** \u201cWhen I get mad, I get those eyes without even knowing it. \u201dHow did you activate it?\u201d Itachi still hadn\u2019t activated the Sharingan. Apparently, the trigger was in the heart somehow, but even Shisui wouldn\u2019t teach him about it. Given that he had gone beyond the average ninja to master basically every skill, the fact that he hadn\u2019t awakened the Sharingan was a hard truth to bear.\n\n**There are very clearly two pseudo-awakenings or short-lived awakenings of Itachi's Sharingan during his experience of the battlefield at 4 and the Nine-Tails Attack at 5. He did not fully awaken it, as he lacked the necessary surge of emotions combined with a strong enough desire for greater power (IMO), but he briefly activated the Sharingan on both occasions.**\n\n**Izumi is a prime example of subconsciously activating the Sharingan without having control over it.**\n\n**The important distinction, in my opinion, is that the Itachi himself makes a concerted effort to push down the Sharingan at the age of 4, rather than embracing it - Thus, it goes away without fully awakening. I believe his intuition to push back the Sharingan's power or else it would consume him relates to the Uchiha Curse of Hatred (Naruto Ch 619), which Itachi never suffered from, even after awakening his Mangekyo. Therefore, I believe this very action based on instinct is the reason Itachi never suffered from the curse like Madara, Obito or Sasuke did (Shisui's obviously Shisui).**\n\n**In conclusion, Itachi awakens it briefly at age 4, before he suppresses it and shuts it off; he activates it again at age 5 before its power subsides; he finally awakens it fully at age 8.**",

A clearly superior clan securing a marriage alliance with a less powerful clan would often bring that clan under the influence of the former rather than vice versa.

One way to conquer in feudal society is by marriage. A powerful clan like the Senju suddenly securing marriage ties with various could be seen as conquest.\n\n>It's not Hashirama's decision to make tho. Hashirama doesn't own the Senju clan. And lol, Hashirama himself didn't do that. His kids and grandkids all wear his name.\n\nHe's the head and the most influential member of the Senju clan. He managed to convince his clan to ally with their rival clan who they fought against for generations. To say he doesn't have sway over his people is just foolish. Hashirama doesn't have to do it since he's the patriarch of the clan. Anyone outside of his direct line can join other clans.\n\nThis is just a theory explaining how the Senju name vanished based on my knowledge of feudal societies which that time period of Naruto is more likely to be based. The members of the Senju clan could've just decided to ditch the name and create a new one for themselves.",

It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

I wouldn't apply how we use last names today as a standard especially towards fantasy worlds. There is a custom in Japanese culture that started all the way back in the 13th century or even further where someone outside of the clan can be adopted and become part of that clan. Sometimes it was done by marrying one of the daughters from the clan but, if there aren't any daughters,  the patriarch can just adopt whoever they feel is qualified. The adopted man will have to take the clan name going forward. An example of this would be [Osamu Suzuki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Suzuki_(businessman)), the former CEO of the Suzuki Motor Corporation. He married into the Suzuki family and ditched his last name in favor of his wife, Shoko Suzuki. So, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of a man taking on the name of his wife's family.",

Keep in mind that they're a founding clan of the village while others like the Sarutobis joined after the village was founded. \n\nPeople opposing Minato like Danzo actually supported Orochimaru becoming Fourth Hokage instead. \n\n>Both Fugaku and Itachi, the people who know his strength best, are both embarrassed by them saying it because of how ridiculous it was.\n\nExcept they were equally ranked by Konoha. The issue about becoming Hokage isn't just about power. It's also about leadership and experience. This was why during the Chunin exams only Shikamaru became a Chunin because of his leadership and tactical abilities.\n\nAs for Fugaku, we don't really see his actual strength  in terms of feats, but from what's implied from the anime adaptation, he was at least powerful enough to wield as much control over Kurama as Obito did with his Mangekyo.\n\nHeck we don't even know what his true power of his Mangekyo Sharingan was, without knowing that its pretty much impossible to rate him either as lower than anyone on that list. \n\nConsidering how the Mangekyo can only be used sparingly, and how Shisui had the Susano'o, it's also theoretically possible that Fugaku may have at least been able to manifest an incomplete Susano'o.\n\nAs for Itachi, he literally stated himself that he didn't want to face his father on the battlefield because he didn't want to fight his father, and because he knew his strength. \n\nAs for Sasuke, he's been trained by Orochimaru in addition to being given other additional enhancements, so he has that feat going for him.",

This puts him well and truly below pretty much any major player in Shippuden, and given Minato\u2019s later feats, for Fugaku to be on his level requires some crazy nonsense. Like, arguably, Fugaku would need to be able to solo the village to reach status as Minato\u2019s equal, which nobody in their right mind suggests. \n\nFugaku wasn\u2019t snubbed because he was an Uchiha. He was snubbed because the other candidates were stronger than him, smarter than him, and more charismatic than him. Simple as that. \n\nThere is nothing to indicate that Fugaku had a Susano\u2019o. Just the opposite actually, seeing as the plan revolves around using Kurama as a weapon and the fact that Fugaku had his vision, when Sasuke pretty much lost his vision completely from a single afternoon of using Susano\u2019o. We have no reason to think his Mangekyo is that strong.\n\nCertainly nothing on the level of fucking Obito, who was controlling a Perfect Jinchuuriki and their Bijuu simultaneously while on other sides of the continent doing his shit and who was able to control Kurama using a Base Sharingan. Lol. Imagine unironically comparing Foddergaku\u2019d Sharingan to Obito\u2019s, who has by far the most ridiculously powerful Sharingan in the series outside of Sasuke\u2019s RinneSharingan.\n\nYou can\u2019t use theoretical shit and \u201cBut We DoN\u2019T KnOW HoW StROng.\u201d To argue a point like this.\n\nFact is, everybody, Danzo, Hiruzen, Itachi, the Elders, absolutely everybody agreed that if Hiruzen had to fight the Uchiha, he would win. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if Fugaku was even close to being on Minato\u2019s level. Hell, the fact that Shisui and Kurama were even involved in the plan to begin with tells you more than enough",

                    "body": "**Excerpts from the Itachi Daylight novel.**  \n\n\n**Age 4 - Page 14:** His father\u2019s voice led Itachi to rub his eyes. He burned the hellscape before him into his retinas so that he would never forget it. A warmth unlike that of his tears wriggled and squirmed within his eyes. The sensation\u2014a wild wave of power flowing toward his retinas\u2014was so terrifying, he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he did, the wave slowly, quietly disappeared into the center of his head. His heart pounded madly, and his breathing was ragged. He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes. Before him, the hellish world was unchanged. He gently pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like if he gave himself over to that power, he would stop being himself somehow.\n\n**Age 5 - Page 27:** In the core of his brain, Itachi heard an ear-splitting screeching. They hadn't actually run that far, and yet he was having trouble breathing. Overlaid on the scene before his eyes was the battlefield he had seen when he was four. War ...A dull pain raced deep into his eyes. Just like that moment on the battlefield, waves of power pulsed behind his eyeballs. He felt like the world was dyed crimson for a moment, but the sensation quickly subsided. \u201cItachi?\u201d his mother called to him from behind, having noticed something strange in her son.\n\n**Age 8 - Page 79-80:** Itachi clutched the blankets even more tightly, as if he could use them to escape the sound of his father\u2019s voice.\u201cNnngh!\u201d Emotions he couldn\u2019t suppress became a groan of anguish, and forced their way out of him. His body shivered and shook. He wasn\u2019t shaking because he was afraid. Anger at his own useless self rocked his body. A sense of helplessness, defeat, emptiness, disappointment. He shook with these waves of emotion, turned inward to race through his body. He wanted power. He didn\u2019t have enough power to protect his teammates. Nor enough to put his father\u2019s mind at ease. More, more ...He would go beyond even that masked man. No, he would have the power to go beyond anyone and everyone in this world. And then, he would grab onto the root of all fighting with his own hands. He felt something hot beneath his tightly closed eyelids. Not tears. Something hotter than that.Throb.He felt a pounding at the nape of his neck, and then something hot like fire shot through his body and concentrated around the pounding, before pouring into his eyes. Itachi finally realized that the source of this blazing power was chakra. Those born into the Uchiha clan were cloaked in a chakra with fire attributes. But he had never before in his life experienced this kind of heat from his chakra. Still, he managed to coolly assess what was occurring within his own body. Eyes still closed, he pushed the blankets off and sat up in his futon, before gradually opening his eyes. Awakening ...\n\n**Page 47: Page 47-48:** \u201cWhen I get mad, I get those eyes without even knowing it. \u201dHow did you activate it?\u201d Itachi still hadn\u2019t activated the Sharingan. Apparently, the trigger was in the heart somehow, but even Shisui wouldn\u2019t teach him about it. Given that he had gone beyond the average ninja to master basically every skill, the fact that he hadn\u2019t awakened the Sharingan was a hard truth to bear.\n\n**There are very clearly two pseudo-awakenings or short-lived awakenings of Itachi's Sharingan during his experience of the battlefield at 4 and the Nine-Tails Attack at 5. He did not fully awaken it, as he lacked the necessary surge of emotions combined with a strong enough desire for greater power (IMO), but he briefly activated the Sharingan on both occasions.**\n\n**Izumi is a prime example of subconsciously activating the Sharingan without having control over it.**\n\n**The important distinction, in my opinion, is that the Itachi himself makes a concerted effort to push down the Sharingan at the age of 4, rather than embracing it - Thus, it goes away without fully awakening. I believe his intuition to push back the Sharingan's power or else it would consume him relates to the Uchiha Curse of Hatred (Naruto Ch 619), which Itachi never suffered from, even after awakening his Mangekyo. Therefore, I believe this very action based on instinct is the reason Itachi never suffered from the curse like Madara, Obito or Sasuke did (Shisui's obviously Shisui).**\n\n**In conclusion, Itachi awakens it briefly at age 4, before he suppresses it and shuts it off; he activates it again at age 5 before its power subsides; he finally awakens it fully at age 8.**",

It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

I wouldn't apply how we use last names today as a standard especially towards fantasy worlds. There is a custom in Japanese culture that started all the way back in the 13th century or even further where someone outside of the clan can be adopted and become part of that clan. Sometimes it was done by marrying one of the daughters from the clan but, if there aren't any daughters,  the patriarch can just adopt whoever they feel is qualified. The adopted man will have to take the clan name going forward. An example of this would be [Osamu Suzuki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Suzuki_(businessman)), the former CEO of the Suzuki Motor Corporation. He married into the Suzuki family and ditched his last name in favor of his wife, Shoko Suzuki. So, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of a man taking on the name of his wife's family.",

This puts him well and truly below pretty much any major player in Shippuden, and given Minato\u2019s later feats, for Fugaku to be on his level requires some crazy nonsense. Like, arguably, Fugaku would need to be able to solo the village to reach status as Minato\u2019s equal, which nobody in their right mind suggests. \n\nFugaku wasn\u2019t snubbed because he was an Uchiha. He was snubbed because the other candidates were stronger than him, smarter than him, and more charismatic than him. Simple as that. \n\nThere is nothing to indicate that Fugaku had a Susano\u2019o. Just the opposite actually, seeing as the plan revolves around using Kurama as a weapon and the fact that Fugaku had his vision, when Sasuke pretty much lost his vision completely from a single afternoon of using Susano\u2019o. We have no reason to think his Mangekyo is that strong.\n\nCertainly nothing on the level of fucking Obito, who was controlling a Perfect Jinchuuriki and their Bijuu simultaneously while on other sides of the continent doing his shit and who was able to control Kurama using a Base Sharingan. Lol. Imagine unironically comparing Foddergaku\u2019d Sharingan to Obito\u2019s, who has by far the most ridiculously powerful Sharingan in the series outside of Sasuke\u2019s RinneSharingan.\n\nYou can\u2019t use theoretical shit and \u201cBut We DoN\u2019T KnOW HoW StROng.\u201d To argue a point like this.\n\nFact is, everybody, Danzo, Hiruzen, Itachi, the Elders, absolutely everybody agreed that if Hiruzen had to fight the Uchiha, he would win. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if Fugaku was even close to being on Minato\u2019s level. Hell, the fact that Shisui and Kurama were even involved in the plan to begin with tells you more than enough",

            "body": "**Excerpts from the Itachi Daylight novel.**  \n\n\n**Age 4 - Page 14:** His father\u2019s voice led Itachi to rub his eyes. He burned the hellscape before him into his retinas so that he would never forget it. A warmth unlike that of his tears wriggled and squirmed within his eyes. The sensation\u2014a wild wave of power flowing toward his retinas\u2014was so terrifying, he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he did, the wave slowly, quietly disappeared into the center of his head. His heart pounded madly, and his breathing was ragged. He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes. Before him, the hellish world was unchanged. He gently pressed a hand to his chest. He felt like if he gave himself over to that power, he would stop being himself somehow.\n\n**Age 5 - Page 27:** In the core of his brain, Itachi heard an ear-splitting screeching. They hadn't actually run that far, and yet he was having trouble breathing. Overlaid on the scene before his eyes was the battlefield he had seen when he was four. War ...A dull pain raced deep into his eyes. Just like that moment on the battlefield, waves of power pulsed behind his eyeballs. He felt like the world was dyed crimson for a moment, but the sensation quickly subsided. \u201cItachi?\u201d his mother called to him from behind, having noticed something strange in her son.\n\n**Age 8 - Page 79-80:** Itachi clutched the blankets even more tightly, as if he could use them to escape the sound of his father\u2019s voice.\u201cNnngh!\u201d Emotions he couldn\u2019t suppress became a groan of anguish, and forced their way out of him. His body shivered and shook. He wasn\u2019t shaking because he was afraid. Anger at his own useless self rocked his body. A sense of helplessness, defeat, emptiness, disappointment. He shook with these waves of emotion, turned inward to race through his body. He wanted power. He didn\u2019t have enough power to protect his teammates. Nor enough to put his father\u2019s mind at ease. More, more ...He would go beyond even that masked man. No, he would have the power to go beyond anyone and everyone in this world. And then, he would grab onto the root of all fighting with his own hands. He felt something hot beneath his tightly closed eyelids. Not tears. Something hotter than that.Throb.He felt a pounding at the nape of his neck, and then something hot like fire shot through his body and concentrated around the pounding, before pouring into his eyes. Itachi finally realized that the source of this blazing power was chakra. Those born into the Uchiha clan were cloaked in a chakra with fire attributes. But he had never before in his life experienced this kind of heat from his chakra. Still, he managed to coolly assess what was occurring within his own body. Eyes still closed, he pushed the blankets off and sat up in his futon, before gradually opening his eyes. Awakening ...\n\n**Page 47: Page 47-48:** \u201cWhen I get mad, I get those eyes without even knowing it. \u201dHow did you activate it?\u201d Itachi still hadn\u2019t activated the Sharingan. Apparently, the trigger was in the heart somehow, but even Shisui wouldn\u2019t teach him about it. Given that he had gone beyond the average ninja to master basically every skill, the fact that he hadn\u2019t awakened the Sharingan was a hard truth to bear.\n\n**There are very clearly two pseudo-awakenings or short-lived awakenings of Itachi's Sharingan during his experience of the battlefield at 4 and the Nine-Tails Attack at 5. He did not fully awaken it, as he lacked the necessary surge of emotions combined with a strong enough desire for greater power (IMO), but he briefly activated the Sharingan on both occasions.**\n\n**Izumi is a prime example of subconsciously activating the Sharingan without having control over it.**\n\n**The important distinction, in my opinion, is that the Itachi himself makes a concerted effort to push down the Sharingan at the age of 4, rather than embracing it - Thus, it goes away without fully awakening. I believe his intuition to push back the Sharingan's power or else it would consume him relates to the Uchiha Curse of Hatred (Naruto Ch 619), which Itachi never suffered from, even after awakening his Mangekyo. Therefore, I believe this very action based on instinct is the reason Itachi never suffered from the curse like Madara, Obito or Sasuke did (Shisui's obviously Shisui).**\n\n**In conclusion, Itachi awakens it briefly at age 4, before he suppresses it and shuts it off; he activates it again at age 5 before its power subsides; he finally awakens it fully at age 8.**",

Besides that this thing will obviously ceased to exist once the village was formed.\n\nBut, Hashirama is not* marrying Mito to conquer that's the difference. It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

Your replies seem to imply that you think I'm stating facts while in reality I'm just exploring ideas.

Every time he meddles, he actively makes the situation worse for Konoha due to him getting in over his head in battle (Sasuke) or by creating more enemies for Konoha (literally everything he does pre-canon).

This method could break away those suspicions.\n\n>Why not simply marry to each clan... Like every single clan did?\n\nDid you mean marry within the clan like the Hyuga and the Uchiha clan did/do? I'm sure not everyone married outside the clan. Only those who are willing to join another clan probably did.\n\n>Not really? Mito Uzumaki married Hashirama and the Senju didn't subjugated the Uzumaki clan in any way. Besides that this thing will obviously ceased to exist once the village was formed.\n\nBut, Hashirama is not* marrying Mito to conquer that's the difference. It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

Hinata didn't stop being a Hyuga when she married. The most drastic changes are done both by Karui and Temari, both women curious enough.\n\nThey are still Senju by blood and still practically tied to the Senju if that's what you meant.

And even then Uzumaki is a far more prestigious name than Namikaze.\n\nI used feudal history as a basis of my theory not the rule. Yes, men retain their names save for special circumstances. That's why I mention joining other clans and not marriage with a commoner.\n\n>Lol, any Senju is prestigious enough to carry the name, it's not about personal deeds but about deeds of the clan.\n\nYou could look at it this way, sure. I'd argue a jobber Senju isn't prestigious enough. There were a lot of Senjus and not all of them are exemplary. \n\n>Because it's never stated that it was the reason or even the alliance needed to be secured in the first place.\n\nThat's why there's room to theorize. Lots of things were left unstated. That's how you keep discussion within the fanbase alive.\n\nI feel like this discussion has ran it's course. Your replies seem to imply that you think I'm stating facts while in reality I'm just exploring ideas. Chances are it's a mixture of low male births, individuals opting to change their names to distinguish themselves and their spawn, people marrying into other clans and choosing their names, and lots of male casualties.",

Every time he meddles, he actively makes the situation worse for Konoha due to him getting in over his head in battle (Sasuke) or by creating more enemies for Konoha (literally everything he does pre-canon).

It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

Your replies seem to imply that you think I'm stating facts while in reality I'm just exploring ideas.

He never actually, you know, succeeds at doing anything. It\u2019s kind of the point of his character. Every time he meddles, he actively makes the situation worse for Konoha due to him getting in over his head in battle (Sasuke) or by creating more enemies for Konoha (literally everything he does pre-canon). He managed to take a done deal, Muu naming him Commander, and instead nearly got the Leaf barred from the Alliance and got the other 4 Kage to mutually agree to never acknowledge him as Hokage and to instead go through Kakashi.\n\nMan is incompetent",

Perception is also important in political matters. \n\n\n>Why would they even try to marry those clans if those suspicions were a thing?\n\nThe goal is to form a peaceful and cooperative existence with the other clans. This method could break away those suspicions.\n\n>Why not simply marry to each clan... Like every single clan did?\n\nDid you mean marry within the clan like the Hyuga and the Uchiha clan did/do? I'm sure not everyone married outside the clan. Only those who are willing to join another clan probably did.\n\n>Not really? Mito Uzumaki married Hashirama and the Senju didn't subjugated the Uzumaki clan in any way. Besides that this thing will obviously ceased to exist once the village was formed.\n\nBut, Hashirama is not* marrying Mito to conquer that's the difference. It was for an alliance between two villages. You can have marriages as a method of subjugation AND to simply tie two nations with an alliance. Especially if said clan is powerful enough to solely control a village of their own. \n\nI never suggested that this continued all the way to modern times. \n\n>I did not say that tho?\n\nYou said Hashirama doesn't have control over other Senju clan members. Which is what having sway over someone means. (Edit: You said it's not Hashirama's decision to make who other members of the clan could marry. Which is not true since, as I said, he's the patriarch and the most capable member of the clan. What he says goes.) \n\n>Lol, Hashirama ruled through example. Anyone outside of his direct line, how convenient.\n\nHe swayed his people through example, correct. It is convenient. He's the head of the clan. His direct descendents  are the only ones who really have to preserve the Senju name. Other clans would have to marry into his bloodline. Those outside of it can marry are disposable in comparison. \n\n>But even in feudal Japan, the men always retained their last name. In the case in which they didn't it was because the name of the woman was so prestigious no one could afford it to be lost. Which is not the case with the Senju.\n\nThat's why I said Hashirama and his direct line is an exception. Him and his brother are the only ones who has to pass on their names. The other nameless Senju are not as prestigious even if they do carry the name.\n\n*edited",

That's a way or forming alliances between clans which goes against the foundation of the village.\n\nYou're talking with such authority here.

Hinata didn't stop being a Hyuga when she married. The most drastic changes are done both by Karui and Temari, both women curious enough.\n\nThey are still Senju by blood and still practically tied to the Senju if that's what you meant. But, formally, they left the Senju to join another clan when they changed their name. Leaving the clan also doesn't always have to result in leaving the village. \n\n>Lol, you were talking about \"how it was done in those times\".

The exceptions are Ino, whose husband didn't have a name and Naruto, because they didn't want people to know who his father was. And even then Uzumaki is a far more prestigious name than Namikaze.\n\nI used feudal history as a basis of my theory not the rule. Yes, men retain their names save for special circumstances. That's why I mention joining other clans and not marriage with a commoner.\n\n>Lol, any Senju is prestigious enough to carry the name, it's not about personal deeds but about deeds of the clan.\n\nYou could look at it this way, sure. I'd argue a jobber Senju isn't prestigious enough. There were a lot of Senjus and not all of them are exemplary. \n\n>Because it's never stated that it was the reason or even the alliance needed to be secured in the first place.\n\nThat's why there's room to theorize. Lots of things were left unstated. That's how you keep discussion within the fanbase alive.\n\nI feel like this discussion has ran it's course. Your replies seem to imply that you think I'm stating facts while in reality I'm just exploring ideas. Chances are it's a mixture of low male births, individuals opting to change their names to distinguish themselves and their spawn, people marrying into other clans and choosing their names, and lots of male casualties.",

Every time he meddles, he actively makes the situation worse for Konoha due to him getting in over his head in battle (Sasuke) or by creating more enemies for Konoha (literally everything he does pre-canon).

That's why I mention joining other clans and not marriage with a commoner.\n\n>Lol, any Senju is prestigious enough to carry the name, it's not about personal deeds but about deeds of the clan.\n\nYou could look at it this way, sure. I'd argue a jobber Senju isn't prestigious enough.

Lots of things were left unstated. That's how you keep discussion within the fanbase alive.\n\nI feel like this discussion has ran it's course. Your replies seem to imply that you think I'm stating facts while in reality I'm just exploring ideas. Chances are it's a mixture of low male births, individuals opting to change their names to distinguish themselves and their spawn, people marrying into other clans and choosing their names, and lots of male casualties.",

He never actually, you know, succeeds at doing anything. It\u2019s kind of the point of his character. Every time he meddles, he actively makes the situation worse for Konoha due to him getting in over his head in battle (Sasuke) or by creating more enemies for Konoha (literally everything he does pre-canon). He managed to take a done deal, Muu naming him Commander, and instead nearly got the Leaf barred from the Alliance and got the other 4 Kage to mutually agree to never acknowledge him as Hokage and to instead go through Kakashi.\n\nMan is incompetent",

Hinata didn't stop being a Hyuga when she married. The most drastic changes are done both by Karui and Temari, both women curious enough.\n\nThey are still Senju by blood and still practically tied to the Senju if that's what you meant. But, formally, they left the Senju to join another clan when they changed their name.

And even then Uzumaki is a far more prestigious name than Namikaze.\n\nI used feudal history as a basis of my theory not the rule. Yes, men retain their names save for special circumstances. That's why I mention joining other clans and not marriage with a commoner.\n\n>Lol, any Senju is prestigious enough to carry the name, it's not about personal deeds but about deeds of the clan.\n\nYou could look at it this way, sure. I'd argue a jobber Senju isn't prestigious enough. There were a lot of Senjus and not all of them are exemplary. \n\n>Because it's never stated that it was the reason or even the alliance needed to be secured in the first place.\n\nThat's why there's room to theorize. Lots of things were left unstated. That's how you keep discussion within the fanbase alive.\n\nI feel like this discussion has ran it's course. Your replies seem to imply that you think I'm stating facts while in reality I'm just exploring ideas. Chances are it's a mixture of low male births, individuals opting to change their names to distinguish themselves and their spawn, people marrying into other clans and choosing their names, and lots of male casualties.",

Like, they\u2019re both far more heavily nerfed than Shisui was. Tsunade\u2019s main problem was her haemophobia, which she overcame thanks to mah boi.\n\nAnd yea, Danzo is horrifically incompetent. He never actually, you know, succeeds at doing anything. It\u2019s kind of the point of his character. Every time he meddles, he actively makes the situation worse for Konoha due to him getting in over his head in battle (Sasuke) or by creating more enemies for Konoha (literally everything he does pre-canon). He managed to take a done deal, Muu naming him Commander, and instead nearly got the Leaf barred from the Alliance and got the other 4 Kage to mutually agree to never acknowledge him as Hokage and to instead go through Kakashi.\n\nMan is incompetent",

Feudal Japan and modern Japan works just like that, men retain their last name save in very special circumstances.\nAnd hardly any woman in Naruto has ever retained their last name.\nThe exceptions are Ino, whose husband didn't have a name and Naruto, because they didn't want people to know who his father was. And even then Uzumaki is a far more prestigious name than Namikaze.\n\nLol, any Senju is prestigious enough to carry the name, it's not about personal deeds but about deeds of the clan.\n\n\n\n>Yes and they could secure that alliance even further by marriage.
