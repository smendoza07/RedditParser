I literally grew up with this show, from an elementary school student to a college student now, and Running Man has been my staple variety show to look forward to every Sunday. Kwang Soo is undeniably the funniest member, and thank you Kwang Soo for bringing so much joy to international viewers all these years.

Recognizing it as a particularly touching episode, he turned the emotional level all the way to eleven, while still retaining RM's variety style by using Kwang Soo's gift as a double hidden mission. \n\nContrary to what I expected, the episode hit right in the feels from the beginning and maintained a somber yet entertaining atmosphere from start to the end. Highlighting Kwang Soo's sincerity and love for the members, wanting to go to the places where they made good memories, the food they love, the music they enjoyed and the gifts that they would cherish, it goes to show how much attachment there is between the members in the show. (Honestly, it should have clicked when we saw the bedding set among the gifts. Why would there be a bedding set given to Kwang Soo?) This is reciprocated in Jaesuk's slightly longer look at him as he said \"Thanks to you, I never felt bored shooting this show\" and JongKook's intense drawing as his dongsaeng read out his letter. \n\nThe use of flashbacks to so many popular episodes and so many songs used made ep 559 a legendary walk back through memory lane, a tribute to Kwang Soo's dedication. We will miss him, and we look forward to the days when he promotes his movies on the show, or comes back for fun.",

I've tried to brighten up the mood by telling a lot of jokes and laughing so loud while watching, but in the end I am the one who cried the hardest among us.\n\nRunning Man made me cry hard six times now. The first time was during the time when they crossed the Han River using a boat made from box during the PD vs Members episode. The second time was when they've got a heart to heart talk with each other during Episode 295. The third time was when Gary left. The fourth time was during the first episodes of Member's Week as Running Man's future in that episodes are in question. The fifth time was during the 9th Anniversary Fan Meeting. And then this...\n\nStill looking forward to the future of the show. Also looking forward to the success of Lee Kwangsoo's career. Runners!

I'm not sure what happened but I hope that they are OK behind the scenes and are on good terms especially after LKS's departure.\n\nThe gifts from LKS was a beautiful twist for the episode - talk about stabbing me with a knife and then twisting it.\n\nLastly, LKS has a free pass to Running Man! I have a feeling he will be back to visit sooner rather than later. Maybe for their 11th anniversary? Maybe for his birthday? Whenever that is - I'm just glad that the door is open for him to return even if it's just a visit.\n\nIt's going to be strange and weird at first without LKS but let's continue to support the show the way we have after all these years.",

I think it really shows a lot about how much he is loved by everyone, from the cast members\u2019 reactions, to the production crew\u2019s gifts and messages, to the comments from celebrities\u2019 who have previously guested. \n\nA huge part of me still hope it isn\u2019t forever goodbye.

Loved how a few episodes back with the 90s theme we we\u2019re all feeling nostalgic and some felt that it would have been a great finale to running man if ever and then here we are with Kwangsoo requesting that they shoot at that same location again. Dang :((( Just goes to show that although that wasn\u2019t one of the funniest episodes for me this year, we know that they actually really enjoyed that concept and that whole episode.\n\nSo many heartwarming and funny moments for this episode. Enjoyed and loved the whole concept of the episode. Also bawled my eyes out whenever the members start being sad \ud83d\ude2d Dang you HAHA, I think he was the first one who made a sad remark that\u2019s why I was already crying on the first 30 minutes or so \ud83d\ude02\n\nCan I just say how much I love Bo Pil, loved it when all the members pranked Sukjin when he was sleeping? I like it when he joins the members\u2019 banters.  \n\nAlso, this episode made me appreciate each members and what they bring to the show and the viewers. Loved that they really became a family (as well as the staff). \n\nYSC made me bawl my eyes out so much in the last location. Can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s the one who\u2019ll make me cry when he\u2019s usually one of the members who make me laugh. You really can see that (although they all are close friends and family already) he\u2019s really one of kwangsoo\u2019s closest friends in the members. \n\nI don\u2019t doubt that LKS\u2019 spirit will still remain in running man especially when his students, YSC and Somin will continue with his teachings in the future episodes! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso seeing Jihyo cry again after a member leaves just breaks my heart. My heart melted when she stayed and wrote another letter for kwang soo. Also loved KJK\u2019s letter. He really has a soft heart but he just doesn\u2019t like to show it. As well as JSM, HAHA, YJS, JSJ\u2019s messages :(( I couldn\u2019t help but bawl my eyes out. They really are a family now :((((((\n\nAND THAT TWIST!!! SO GOOD! RUNNING MAN NEVER FAILS IN MAKING ME BE AMAZED BY THEIR GAMES, TWISTS, MISSIONS, etc. I\u2019m so glad that I haven\u2019t finished watching all 559 episodes because I can still look forward in seeing our giraffe when I watch the past episodes! \n\nFinally, to our Girin. Thank you! You\u2019re one of the reasons that I really got hooked into watching RM. Thank you because you and the whole RM team, made me escape this pandemic we\u2019re facing right now. We\u2019ll always support you with whatever you\u2019re going to do in the future! And as YSC so well put it, Enjoy doing all the things you like without thinking of punishments! I will also continue with supporting RM and the remaining members! \n\nPS. Hopefully we\u2019ll still see you in RM as a guest (or even as a regular member again) soon! Good for the crew to give kwang soo that free pass gift \ud83d\ude02\n\nI still have a lot of things on my mind but for now, this would suffice I think. Sorry if this post is long but i just really need to let these feelings out \ud83d\ude2d And if you guys are still reading this, thanks for coming to my another TED talk \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019d love to hear your messages for kwangsoo in the comment sections if you guys are able to drop it. =))",

            "body": "I\u2019ve been watching the show since it aired its very first ep and have to admit I used to not like Kwangsoo because I used to think he was very attention-seeking and didn\u2019t understand why he purposely established his character to be slapstick humour, cheating and betraying. He just wasn\u2019t my style. I disliked him so much that I watch almost every ep except the ones that were him-focused. But that was me being young and immature. Over the years I realised how important every member is and the roles they play contribute a lot of synergy to the show. I saw how much heart and soul he put into each ep, and how he brings out the laughter at the expense of himself and is often one of the most popular among guests because he takes care of others well and they can feel comfortable. \n\nBut I still didn\u2019t expect to feel so sad when the news of him leaving came out but I did. And I cried so much more in this episode than I thought I would. It\u2019s just like KJK said, I really thought he would be there till the end. \n\nThe episode was so well designed, from the framing of all his offenses to remind us of what he did for the show, to the film photography hidden missions as a great excuse for all of them to unashamedly keep being close and taking as many pictures together in the name of the mission but really to get nice photos at the end! Felt both super meaningful and still very RM. And of course, just by allowing them to spend time together, doing what they had done before one more time. Even the boiled egg and pirate roulette was so apt. I love how he finally got 5/7 boiled eggs only when it didn\u2019t matter at all, and the pirate jumping out to remind us one last time LKS is adored by the variety god.\n\nSeeing some of the members struggling to hold back their tears was just as sad as the ones who did cry, because you can see just how much they cherished one another\u2019s presence all these years. Each letter was simple yet heartfelt, even though it\u2019s quite impossible to encompass all their feelings in a simple letter. That\u2019s why i really liked how they showed Jihyo couldn\u2019t articulate her true feelings properly made sure to stay back till she could write another one, cause it\u2019s so real. And of course he loves them so much too. That last twist really sealed the deal, he wanted to give and not receive, and he really did. Not just thoughtfully choosing the right gift for each, but also spending the entire recording looking out for each member and giving them as much equal attention as he could. \n\nThere were so many great flashbacks in this episode, yet because there has been so so many epic memories it is impossible to showcase them all. I loved the last highlight reel where they included not just the obviously funny and unlucky moments he is more known for, but the little caring moments where he looked out for others and cheered on others. \n\nPeople may think it\u2019s just a show, why are we all crying so much over it, but Running Man has been our youth, our joy, and our beloved entertainment for 11 years, they\u2019re a part of our lives. And it wouldn\u2019t have been this Running Man we know and love without Lee Kwang Soo. Thank you for running, our Giraffe.",

I associate Sechan with a constant smiling face with gums out, but to see him being this affected really caught me off guard. It made me become a fan of Sechan since he knows how good a person Kwangsoo is.

You can see how much the members and staff love Kwangsoo and how much Kwangsoo loves them back.\n\nI hope Kwangsoo knows how happy he\u2019s made so many people. He came onto Running Man in 2010 as a variety newbie but never failed to give us laughter and joy and truly gave his all during every episode. It\u2019s insane to think that Running Man has mostly stayed with the same cast for the past 11 years and I\u2019m forever grateful to every single one of them. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard watching next week\u2019s episode knowing Kwangsoo isn\u2019t there but I\u2019m also happy that Kwangsoo will be able to focus on his health and career.

In my family I'm the only one who watches RM and this episode broke my heart in a way I never imagined.  LKS is my favorite member of RM, there were several times I found myself imitating something he did on the show or simply reviewing a special moment of him in each episode.  I really hope he is successful.  on his new journey and I will continue to support all the other members of the program as I am sure this is what our dear giraffe most desires. I've been preparing for this episode ever since I saw the news about her leaving, but I couldn't hold back the tears and cried a lot.  I hope that we can all support each other in this sad moment and make good memories with the members who will continue in RM, giving all the support to them.",

I felt sad the whole day after watching this episode, the emotion lingers as reality sets in. Like what others have mentioned, we fans probably expected him to be one of the last person to ever leave the show, so that hit hard. Plus the fact that he kept apologizing for leaving, him buying farewell presents for the cast, and him keeping quiet when members were joking that he can still change his mind meant that LKS had made up his mind to leave for sure. \n\nI\u2019ve also never seen YSC and KJK so upset before. KJK didn\u2019t cry but it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s upset, his jaw was clenched and he kept avoiding eye contact. \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t boring because of you\u201d, thank you for being the comfort for us who grew up with the show. \n\nI can\u2019t wait for the newer episodes to be out so we can get used to the new \u2018feel\u2019 of the show, and move back to a more cheerful mood.",

This joy you\u2019ve spread to us will last for a lifetime and although we don\u2019t know you personally, you\u2019ll always be our brother and friend.\n\nGoodbye for now and good luck with your future. You will always have a place in our hearts.",

Him hanging out with her brother, her dad being a fan of his. Obviously, we won\u2019t know what happened but I take it as a good sign that she followed him again.
