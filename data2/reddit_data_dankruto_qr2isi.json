Some shows just don\u2019t get where the line is, like with Seaven deadly sins where sexual assault=funny joke. Those types of characters should be more like Sanji rather than Jiraiya.",

Yet, somehow you state that it's fine because they weren't romantically involved? Wowza! What. A. Take. We are off to a good start.\n\n>EVERYONE forgives Sasuke.\n\nI know and it was dumb. Sasuke was an internationally wanted criminal who was partially responsible for the war arc. \n\n>Sakura was the one that tried to murder Sasuke. She literally plotted his death and tracked him down to kill him. He attacked her back in the heat of the moment during a total mental breakdown.\n\n\nThey tried to kill each other in what you, seemingly, call a very healthy relationship. I don't care about who shot first. I care about the fact that either partner shot at the other at all. But Sasuke tried to kill Sakura first anyways. Back in the very beginning of shuppiden. \n\n>Sakura doesn't just love Sasuke because he's attractive. Did you actually watch Part I or did you just start watching during the middle of Part II and skip the parts where this guy was willing to die for her?\n\nWell. Do tell. Why does she love him, if not for his looks? Because that is what she said in part one. All the girls had the hots for the cute emo kid. Also, die for her? When did Sasuke ever try to die for her? Prior to the post-war arc?",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me.

Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him.

I *literally* can't believe you are being disingenuous.  \n\n>And you know I never even said that their relationship was \"healthy\" you keep using that phrase.\n\nBecause I'm arguing that their relationship is toxic and you seem to be arguing that it isn't. But of course, in your usual disingenuous fashion, you try to claim that you aren't saying the things you are saying. And every time I've used \"healthy\" I've put it in quotes to highlight the sarcasm. So I ask you... Why are you arguing if you are going to keep claiming that you aren't arguing? And the reason I say that is every time I ask you to back up what you say or provide the clarification you claim that that isn't what you are saying, or that isn't what you mean, and then turn around and defend it.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

As I hope that you realize that things you disagree with are also a part of your worldview alongside things you agree with?\n\nMy quote never once stated that authors only write about things they agree with. my quote said that what an author writes about reflects what they think.\n\n>if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have\n\nThis was in direct reference to Kishimoto and how he handles relationships. Which is where we started. But then somehow it became about all writers everywhere. I think Kishimoto doesn't realize how his handling of relationships comes off or unintentionally showed how he views relationships. BTW, this still doesn't contradict anything I said. It doesn't contradict the above statement either. I hope this clears things up.",

Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them. \n\nThis is the full quote. Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is.

Compound that with his sheer inability to write teenage girls and you get characters whose entire identity revolves around boys. That's why I notice a stark difference in quality between characters like Tsunade, Chiyo, and to a lesser extent, Konan compared to the Konoha girls because their entire world doesn't revolve around men.\n\nHowever, even with that group the men in their life are still a dominant factor. Tsunade does everything in the memory of her boyfriend/fiance and her brother. Chiyo feels tremendous guilt for Sasori. Konan was follower of Yahiko and Nagato.\n\nSo does Kishimoto hate women? No, actually compared to the vast majority of shonen authors he's a lot less exploitative. You don't have to go that far just look at the two other members of the Big 3. But he is sexist because he views women traditionally and thinks that a man is the most important thing in their lives.",

This is way beyond degeneracy bruh. And so many adult anime characters look at 15-16 year old characters like they're their age. Japan even is stricter in their definitions of adulthood too. Up until a few years ago you only became a legal adult at 20 in Japan, and even now 18 year olds there mostly just have the right to vote and in many other respects are still considered underage. So wtf is this?  \n\n\nAnd before you bring up the age of consent, it adheres to certain age restrictions. If you do a 2 second Google search it'll tell yout the age of consent is 13, however it's not like a 13 year old can consent to anyone of any age, they're restricted to only 13-15 year olds, I believe.",

Some shows just don\u2019t get where the line is, like with Seaven deadly sins where sexual assault=funny joke. Those types of characters should be more like Sanji rather than Jiraiya.",

Yet, somehow you state that it's fine because they weren't romantically involved? Wowza! What. A. Take. We are off to a good start.\n\n>EVERYONE forgives Sasuke.\n\nI know and it was dumb. Sasuke was an internationally wanted criminal who was partially responsible for the war arc. \n\n>Sakura was the one that tried to murder Sasuke. She literally plotted his death and tracked him down to kill him. He attacked her back in the heat of the moment during a total mental breakdown.\n\n\nThey tried to kill each other in what you, seemingly, call a very healthy relationship. I don't care about who shot first. I care about the fact that either partner shot at the other at all. But Sasuke tried to kill Sakura first anyways. Back in the very beginning of shuppiden. \n\n>Sakura doesn't just love Sasuke because he's attractive. Did you actually watch Part I or did you just start watching during the middle of Part II and skip the parts where this guy was willing to die for her?\n\nWell. Do tell. Why does she love him, if not for his looks? Because that is what she said in part one. All the girls had the hots for the cute emo kid. Also, die for her? When did Sasuke ever try to die for her? Prior to the post-war arc?",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me.

Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

And every time I've used \"healthy\" I've put it in quotes to highlight the sarcasm. So I ask you... Why are you arguing if you are going to keep claiming that you aren't arguing? And the reason I say that is every time I ask you to back up what you say or provide the clarification you claim that that isn't what you are saying, or that isn't what you mean, and then turn around and defend it. It's so disingenuous, fallacious, and completely asinine.\n\n \n>No you just legit don't seem to understand anything.\n\nI understand that you are a deceitful person who makes fallacious arguments and is unwilling to actually support what you say.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly.

It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

As I hope that you realize that things you disagree with are also a part of your worldview alongside things you agree with?\n\nMy quote never once stated that authors only write about things they agree with. my quote said that what an author writes about reflects what they think.\n\n>if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have\n\nThis was in direct reference to Kishimoto and how he handles relationships. Which is where we started. But then somehow it became about all writers everywhere. I think Kishimoto doesn't realize how his handling of relationships comes off or unintentionally showed how he views relationships. BTW, this still doesn't contradict anything I said. It doesn't contradict the above statement either. I hope this clears things up.",

I think, personally, that he didn't realize that the relationship was toxic. \n\n>Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them.\n\nAnd here is me quoted as saying as such. I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text.

Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them. \n\nThis is the full quote. Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is. Either way, it is a reflection of his world views, and how he perceives certain things.",

Compound that with his sheer inability to write teenage girls and you get characters whose entire identity revolves around boys. That's why I notice a stark difference in quality between characters like Tsunade, Chiyo, and to a lesser extent, Konan compared to the Konoha girls because their entire world doesn't revolve around men.\n\nHowever, even with that group the men in their life are still a dominant factor. Tsunade does everything in the memory of her boyfriend/fiance and her brother. Chiyo feels tremendous guilt for Sasori. Konan was follower of Yahiko and Nagato.\n\nSo does Kishimoto hate women? No, actually compared to the vast majority of shonen authors he's a lot less exploitative. You don't have to go that far just look at the two other members of the Big 3. But he is sexist because he views women traditionally and thinks that a man is the most important thing in their lives.",

Times are very different now and with that being said, his actions don't look good at all but that wasn't his ENTIRE purpose/character.

Some shows just don\u2019t get where the line is, like with Seaven deadly sins where sexual assault=funny joke. Those types of characters should be more like Sanji rather than Jiraiya.",

Back in the very beginning of shuppiden.\n\nIf you want to call it an unhealthy relationship there has to actually be a relationship beyond being enemies.\n\nSakura attacked Sasuke first then to, he ignored her in combat up until the point she tried to attack him with power that would have killed him.\n\nIt's actually a plot point that Sasuke doesn't kill people at this stage of the series, so Yamato saying he would have killed her doesn't mean anything.\n\n\n>Well. Do tell. Why does she love him, if not for his looks? Because that is what she said in part one. All the girls had the hots for the cute emo kid. Also, die for her? When did Sasuke ever try to die for her? Prior to the post-war arc?\n\nGo back and read Part I then complain about their relationship. You're clearly missing a few key events.",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them. \n\nThis is the full quote. Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is. Either way, it is a reflection of his world views, and how he perceives certain things.",

Compound that with his sheer inability to write teenage girls and you get characters whose entire identity revolves around boys. That's why I notice a stark difference in quality between characters like Tsunade, Chiyo, and to a lesser extent, Konan compared to the Konoha girls because their entire world doesn't revolve around men.\n\nHowever, even with that group the men in their life are still a dominant factor. Tsunade does everything in the memory of her boyfriend/fiance and her brother. Chiyo feels tremendous guilt for Sasori. Konan was follower of Yahiko and Nagato.\n\nSo does Kishimoto hate women? No, actually compared to the vast majority of shonen authors he's a lot less exploitative. You don't have to go that far just look at the two other members of the Big 3. But he is sexist because he views women traditionally and thinks that a man is the most important thing in their lives.",

He was supposed to be a failed child of prophecy looking to end the cycle of hatred in the shinobi world. That was his main purpose. The perverted spa scenes and spying were just for \"Comedic\" relief during a time where people were not so sensitive and thought it was funny not 100% serious. Times are very different now and with that being said, his actions don't look good at all but that wasn't his ENTIRE purpose/character. Also, I was just pointing out that OP is spreading misinformation about an edited translation.",

Idk where you're from but, calling someone beautiful in that way is not flirtatious at all. It's like someone telling a member of their family that they will grow up to be strong and beautiful one day. There's no reach there at all, that's just a normal thing that people say to people they care about. It's not flirtatious in any way. \n\nHowever, saying something like... \"Konan, you'll grow up to be hot one day\", is a HUGE difference. It's night and day. \n\nIf you still disagree then we can end this discussion rn.",

He attacked her back in the heat of the moment during a total mental breakdown.\n\n\nThey tried to kill each other in what you, seemingly, call a very healthy relationship. I don't care about who shot first. I care about the fact that either partner shot at the other at all. But Sasuke tried to kill Sakura first anyways. Back in the very beginning of shuppiden. \n\n>Sakura doesn't just love Sasuke because he's attractive. Did you actually watch Part I or did you just start watching during the middle of Part II and skip the parts where this guy was willing to die for her?\n\nWell. Do tell. Why does she love him, if not for his looks? Because that is what she said in part one. All the girls had the hots for the cute emo kid. Also, die for her? When did Sasuke ever try to die for her? Prior to the post-war arc?",

This is the same argument as \"it's a story about space wizards meant for children.\" And I consider that argument incredibly fallacious. \n\n>Then you should hate every character in series.\n\nthis series right? Your grammar is really bad, so it's hard to comprehend the things you are scrapping your brain cells together to say. And to answer this question(?), I don't hate everything about Naruto, but I don't like everything about it either. And I'm going to talk about the things I don't like. Like the really bad, forced shipping.\n\n>They are enemies. Then they aren't. The negative relationship was while they were enemies. This ain't hard.\n\nAnd so that makes it okay? You do realize you are trivializing the whole, \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect of their relationship. And That's only one aspect of why I consider their relationship toxic. \n\n>And these child soldiers weren't in a relationship at the time. They were enemies. Now they aren't.\n\nAnd that still doesn't make it okay. If two people from our real reality told me they tried to murder each other, but now they love each other, I'd think they were crazy. That sounds like very toxic origins and I do not care about the circumstances as to why. It. is. still. Toxic. And what's worse is that it is never talked about or mentioned. Which makes it way worse. \n\n>If you didn't even know something as major as the fact that Sasuke was willing to die for Sakura at one point, I'm not going to walk you through their interactions over 181 chapters.\n\nSasuke was willing to die for Naruto. That doesn't mean anything. people keep bringing that up as if it means something. So is Sasuke in love with Naruto? Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\n>Read it yourself and pay better attention this time.\n\nThis is projection. You should reflect on your statement here and realize that you are the one that didn't pay attention.",

This is the same argument as \"it's a story about space wizards meant for children.\" And I consider that argument incredibly fallacious. \n\nWho said it should be free from criticism?\n\nThe problem is that you are ignoring the greater context of the world these characters live in.\n\n>hard to comprehend the things you are scrapping your brain cells together to say. And to answer this question(?), I don't hate everything about Naruto, but I don't like everything about it either. And I'm going to talk about the things I don't like. Like the really bad, forced shipping.\n\nOh no!\n\nI missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make!\n\nClearly I'm as a dumb as you are.\n\nThe point I was making, which was too difficult for you comprehend without \"the\", is that every character in Naruto is either to forgiving of the horrifying things other characters do or guilty of committing the horrifying acts themselves.\n\n>And so that makes it okay? You do realize you are trivializing the whole, \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect of their relationship. And That's only one aspect of why I consider their relationship toxic. \n\nI trivialize the \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect because in this world it is trivial.\n\nChild soldiers, remember?\n\nThese kids use lethal attacks against each other when training and taking tests.\n\n>And that still doesn't make it okay. If two people from our real reality told me they tried to murder each other, but now they love each other, I'd think they were crazy. \n\nHow would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\nAnd of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nOh and this all happened before *seventeen*...\n\n>That sounds like very toxic origins and I do not care about the circumstances as to why. It. is. still. Toxic. And what's worse is that it is never talked about or mentioned. Which makes it way worse. \n\nIt's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nYou act like they jumped into bed after Iron Country. There were years between chapter 699 and their marriage.\n\n>Sasuke was willing to die for Naruto. That doesn't mean anything. people keep bringing that up as if it means something. So is Sasuke in love with Naruto? Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\nWow.\n\nAnd you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n>This is projection. You should reflect on your statement here and realize that you are the one that didn't pay attention.\n\nCool story, bro.\n\nHow about this...\n\nCan you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

This happens in the real world all the time - horrible people are rewarded, even though they've done terrible things. that doesn't mean the writer approves of the terrible actions. Writing about these things does not mean you think it's \"good\".\n\nWhich would be me putting my personal opinion into the work right? Because I'm of the opinion that you can't truly divorce yourself from your fictional works. And that authors, no matter how hard they try, will put end up creating a fiction that shares their world view. No matter how big or small. \n\n>this just isn't true at all, for the reasons above \n\nI disagree. You can't truly divorce yourself from what you write. And that what you write tends to reflect your thoughts and feelings.",

I think, personally, that he didn't realize that the relationship was toxic. \n\n>Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them.\n\nAnd here is me quoted as saying as such. I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text. And based on my readings of Naruto. His girl characters are terrible.",

Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships.

She has several quotes that are all about how Naruto is her inspiration for her existence, or what keeps her going, or makes her strong.  \n\n>She jad different dreams which didn't involve marrying him.\n\nWhat are they?\n\n >She is the only one who helps him like that and saving the MC is important bcz he is the MC and it was especially important in War Arc as he was most important to win the war.\n\nSo she is the only one to realize Naruto is important to the world? No one else? And yet she isn't motivated or influenced or simply exists for Naruto. \n\n>Where are you making this stuff from? If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.\n\nWasn't Hinata always portrayed as being stalkerish to Naruto.

He was supposed to be a failed child of prophecy looking to end the cycle of hatred in the shinobi world. That was his main purpose. The perverted spa scenes and spying were just for \"Comedic\" relief during a time where people were not so sensitive and thought it was funny not 100% serious. Times are very different now and with that being said, his actions don't look good at all but that wasn't his ENTIRE purpose/character.

Yet, somehow you state that it's fine because they weren't romantically involved? Wowza! What. A. Take. We are off to a good start.\n\n>EVERYONE forgives Sasuke.\n\nI know and it was dumb. Sasuke was an internationally wanted criminal who was partially responsible for the war arc. \n\n>Sakura was the one that tried to murder Sasuke. She literally plotted his death and tracked him down to kill him. He attacked her back in the heat of the moment during a total mental breakdown.\n\n\nThey tried to kill each other in what you, seemingly, call a very healthy relationship. I don't care about who shot first. I care about the fact that either partner shot at the other at all. But Sasuke tried to kill Sakura first anyways. Back in the very beginning of shuppiden. \n\n>Sakura doesn't just love Sasuke because he's attractive. Did you actually watch Part I or did you just start watching during the middle of Part II and skip the parts where this guy was willing to die for her?\n\nWell. Do tell. Why does she love him, if not for his looks? Because that is what she said in part one. All the girls had the hots for the cute emo kid. Also, die for her? When did Sasuke ever try to die for her? Prior to the post-war arc?",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated.

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

This happens in the real world all the time - horrible people are rewarded, even though they've done terrible things. that doesn't mean the writer approves of the terrible actions. Writing about these things does not mean you think it's \"good\".\n\nWhich would be me putting my personal opinion into the work right? Because I'm of the opinion that you can't truly divorce yourself from your fictional works. And that authors, no matter how hard they try, will put end up creating a fiction that shares their world view. No matter how big or small. \n\n>this just isn't true at all, for the reasons above \n\nI disagree. You can't truly divorce yourself from what you write.

Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them. \n\nThis is the full quote. Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is. Either way, it is a reflection of his world views, and how he perceives certain things.",

She has several quotes that are all about how Naruto is her inspiration for her existence, or what keeps her going, or makes her strong.  \n\n>She jad different dreams which didn't involve marrying him.\n\nWhat are they?\n\n >She is the only one who helps him like that and saving the MC is important bcz he is the MC and it was especially important in War Arc as he was most important to win the war.\n\nSo she is the only one to realize Naruto is important to the world? No one else? And yet she isn't motivated or influenced or simply exists for Naruto. \n\n>Where are you making this stuff from? If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.\n\nWasn't Hinata always portrayed as being stalkerish to Naruto. Constantly watching him from a distance to afraid to approach?\n\n>If she wanted attention here she would have said something but she lied to him that she wasn't thinking about that so he doesnt concern much over her.\n\nSo she takes an action that is in the best interests of Naruto? I don't think you realized what you admitted to.",

Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\n>Read it yourself and pay better attention this time.\n\nThis is projection.

If two people from our real reality told me they tried to murder each other, but now they love each other, I'd think they were crazy. \n\nHow would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\nAnd of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nOh and this all happened before *seventeen*...\n\n>That sounds like very toxic origins and I do not care about the circumstances as to why. It. is. still. Toxic. And what's worse is that it is never talked about or mentioned. Which makes it way worse. \n\nIt's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nYou act like they jumped into bed after Iron Country. There were years between chapter 699 and their marriage.\n\n>Sasuke was willing to die for Naruto. That doesn't mean anything. people keep bringing that up as if it means something. So is Sasuke in love with Naruto? Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\nWow.\n\nAnd you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n>This is projection. You should reflect on your statement here and realize that you are the one that didn't pay attention.\n\nCool story, bro.\n\nHow about this...\n\nCan you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

This is literally you telling me to point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura. Which as I remind you. Is irrelevant. And according to you doesn't even matter. as it... and I am quoting you \" Doesn't prove or disprove anything about their relationship\".\n\n>Maybe if you had better reading comprehension you would have understood that since it was part of a paragraph about Sakura's feelings for Sasuke, it was a general reference to the good things about his character.\n\nSo is him saving Sakura's life relevant or irrelevant?

But of course, in your usual disingenuous fashion, you try to claim that you aren't saying the things you are saying. And every time I've used \"healthy\" I've put it in quotes to highlight the sarcasm. So I ask you... Why are you arguing if you are going to keep claiming that you aren't arguing? And the reason I say that is every time I ask you to back up what you say or provide the clarification you claim that that isn't what you are saying, or that isn't what you mean, and then turn around and defend it. It's so disingenuous, fallacious, and completely asinine.\n\n \n>No you just legit don't seem to understand anything.\n\nI understand that you are a deceitful person who makes fallacious arguments and is unwilling to actually support what you say.

I understand that you sir, or madam, are a dumbass. full stop.

Yes, you are. Are we done here? Are you going to keep coming back? Do you enjoy looking like an idiot? Am I dealing with a masochist who is enjoying all these insults?

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

Authors can frame things in a neutral or positive lens without agreeing with those things.\n\nThen they would still be projecting their thoughts and opinions into their work. It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.\n\nWasn't Hinata always portrayed as being stalkerish to Naruto. Constantly watching him from a distance to afraid to approach?\n\n>If she wanted attention here she would have said something but she lied to him that she wasn't thinking about that so he doesnt concern much over her.\n\nSo she takes an action that is in the best interests of Naruto? I don't think you realized what you admitted to.",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

            "body": "> I think this is a really bad take and a terrible way of interpreting any kind of story. Authors can frame things in a neutral or positive lens without agreeing with those things.\n\nThen they would still be projecting their thoughts and opinions into their work. It is nearly impossible to separate one's baises from one's fictional works.\n\n>Do you think it's impossible for an atheist author to frame a theistic character in a positive light? Or vise versa? Does the author of Game of Thrones believe incest is okay because the characters in GoT think incest is acceptable? Of course not.\n\nI never said it was impossible. I said that characters and their actions/words/etc. directly reflect the author's thoughts and opinions on subjects/actions/morals/etc. By having an atheistic author writing a theistic character as morally positive the author would be stating that they think positively of theistic individuals or at least think they are capable of being morally good. Which is what I said. Incest in \"game of thrones\" wasn't viewed positively and most characters chided cerci(?) and her brother for engaging in incest. But even then. That doesn't disagree with what I said. As my opinion is that the author's thoughts and feelings influence their work. So you didn't get me here either. \n\n>No every story is meant to be written with a moral. \n\nTrue, not every story has a moral. But Naruto does. Kishimoto was big on talking about moral philosophy, but he drops the ball on the relationships the girl characters engage in. \n\n> Sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing wrong with depicting that in fiction. These things don't need to be punished within the story or framed as negatives in every circumstance.\n\nOkay, but this is fiction. It is made up. Things don't just happen in fictional works. That's not how writing things work. And if you write stories where characters make bad decisions and are rewarded for it, you are unintentionally or intentionally showing how you think certain actions should be handled or what consequences you think certain actions should have. If I wrote a story about a dad who molests his daughter and then runs for president and has this fact found out, but in my story, the dad wins because of that allegation and not despite that allegation, then you'd question me about my opinions on molestation, right?",

Because I'm of the opinion that you can't truly divorce yourself from your fictional works.

Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them. \n\nThis is the full quote. Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is. Either way, it is a reflection of his world views, and how he perceives certain things.",

No one else? And yet she isn't motivated or influenced or simply exists for Naruto. \n\n>Where are you making this stuff from? If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.\n\nWasn't Hinata always portrayed as being stalkerish to Naruto.

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

Writing about these things does not mean you think it's \"good\".\n\nWhich would be me putting my personal opinion into the work right?

Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is.

If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.

She has several quotes that are all about how Naruto is her inspiration for her existence, or what keeps her going, or makes her strong.  \n\n>She jad different dreams which didn't involve marrying him.\n\nWhat are they?\n\n >She is the only one who helps him like that and saving the MC is important bcz he is the MC and it was especially important in War Arc as he was most important to win the war.\n\nSo she is the only one to realize Naruto is important to the world? No one else? And yet she isn't motivated or influenced or simply exists for Naruto. \n\n>Where are you making this stuff from? If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.\n\nWasn't Hinata always portrayed as being stalkerish to Naruto. Constantly watching him from a distance to afraid to approach?\n\n>If she wanted attention here she would have said something but she lied to him that she wasn't thinking about that so he doesnt concern much over her.\n\nSo she takes an action that is in the best interests of Naruto?

This is the same argument as \"it's a story about space wizards meant for children.\" And I consider that argument incredibly fallacious. \n\n>Then you should hate every character in series.\n\nthis series right? Your grammar is really bad, so it's hard to comprehend the things you are scrapping your brain cells together to say. And to answer this question(?), I don't hate everything about Naruto, but I don't like everything about it either. And I'm going to talk about the things I don't like. Like the really bad, forced shipping.\n\n>They are enemies. Then they aren't. The negative relationship was while they were enemies. This ain't hard.\n\nAnd so that makes it okay? You do realize you are trivializing the whole, \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect of their relationship. And That's only one aspect of why I consider their relationship toxic. \n\n>And these child soldiers weren't in a relationship at the time. They were enemies. Now they aren't.\n\nAnd that still doesn't make it okay. If two people from our real reality told me they tried to murder each other, but now they love each other, I'd think they were crazy. That sounds like very toxic origins and I do not care about the circumstances as to why. It. is. still. Toxic. And what's worse is that it is never talked about or mentioned. Which makes it way worse. \n\n>If you didn't even know something as major as the fact that Sasuke was willing to die for Sakura at one point, I'm not going to walk you through their interactions over 181 chapters.\n\nSasuke was willing to die for Naruto. That doesn't mean anything. people keep bringing that up as if it means something. So is Sasuke in love with Naruto? Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\n>Read it yourself and pay better attention this time.\n\nThis is projection. You should reflect on your statement here and realize that you are the one that didn't pay attention.",

                    "body": ">Yeah, and you realize that just because it's fiction doesn't mean it's free from criticism? This is the same argument as \"it's a story about space wizards meant for children.\" And I consider that argument incredibly fallacious. \n\nWho said it should be free from criticism?\n\nThe problem is that you are ignoring the greater context of the world these characters live in.\n\n>hard to comprehend the things you are scrapping your brain cells together to say. And to answer this question(?), I don't hate everything about Naruto, but I don't like everything about it either. And I'm going to talk about the things I don't like. Like the really bad, forced shipping.\n\nOh no!\n\nI missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make!\n\nClearly I'm as a dumb as you are.\n\nThe point I was making, which was too difficult for you comprehend without \"the\", is that every character in Naruto is either to forgiving of the horrifying things other characters do or guilty of committing the horrifying acts themselves.\n\n>And so that makes it okay? You do realize you are trivializing the whole, \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect of their relationship. And That's only one aspect of why I consider their relationship toxic. \n\nI trivialize the \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect because in this world it is trivial.\n\nChild soldiers, remember?\n\nThese kids use lethal attacks against each other when training and taking tests.\n\n>And that still doesn't make it okay. If two people from our real reality told me they tried to murder each other, but now they love each other, I'd think they were crazy. \n\nHow would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\nAnd of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nOh and this all happened before *seventeen*...\n\n>That sounds like very toxic origins and I do not care about the circumstances as to why. It. is. still. Toxic. And what's worse is that it is never talked about or mentioned. Which makes it way worse. \n\nIt's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nYou act like they jumped into bed after Iron Country. There were years between chapter 699 and their marriage.\n\n>Sasuke was willing to die for Naruto. That doesn't mean anything. people keep bringing that up as if it means something. So is Sasuke in love with Naruto? Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\nWow.\n\nAnd you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n>This is projection. You should reflect on your statement here and realize that you are the one that didn't pay attention.\n\nCool story, bro.\n\nHow about this...\n\nCan you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?",

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them. \n\nThis is the full quote. Where I state that it could be unintentional. Which it very well could, but that would still be a reflection of Kishimoto and his views on relationships. Because to write into the lore that SasuSaku is a thing he would have to have been fine with or not cared about how toxic their relationship is. Either way, it is a reflection of his world views, and how he perceives certain things.",

She has several quotes that are all about how Naruto is her inspiration for her existence, or what keeps her going, or makes her strong.  \n\n>She jad different dreams which didn't involve marrying him.\n\nWhat are they?\n\n >She is the only one who helps him like that and saving the MC is important bcz he is the MC and it was especially important in War Arc as he was most important to win the war.\n\nSo she is the only one to realize Naruto is important to the world? No one else? And yet she isn't motivated or influenced or simply exists for Naruto. \n\n>Where are you making this stuff from? If she wanted his attention she would be following him everywhere and also asking him about his confession to her.\n\nWasn't Hinata always portrayed as being stalkerish to Naruto. Constantly watching him from a distance to afraid to approach?\n\n>If she wanted attention here she would have said something but she lied to him that she wasn't thinking about that so he doesnt concern much over her.\n\nSo she takes an action that is in the best interests of Naruto? I don't think you realized what you admitted to.",

            "body": ">Yeah, and you realize that just because it's fiction doesn't mean it's free from criticism? This is the same argument as \"it's a story about space wizards meant for children.\" And I consider that argument incredibly fallacious. \n\nWho said it should be free from criticism?\n\nThe problem is that you are ignoring the greater context of the world these characters live in.\n\n>hard to comprehend the things you are scrapping your brain cells together to say. And to answer this question(?), I don't hate everything about Naruto, but I don't like everything about it either. And I'm going to talk about the things I don't like. Like the really bad, forced shipping.\n\nOh no!\n\nI missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make!\n\nClearly I'm as a dumb as you are.\n\nThe point I was making, which was too difficult for you comprehend without \"the\", is that every character in Naruto is either to forgiving of the horrifying things other characters do or guilty of committing the horrifying acts themselves.\n\n>And so that makes it okay? You do realize you are trivializing the whole, \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect of their relationship. And That's only one aspect of why I consider their relationship toxic. \n\nI trivialize the \"they tried to murder each other\" aspect because in this world it is trivial.\n\nChild soldiers, remember?\n\nThese kids use lethal attacks against each other when training and taking tests.\n\n>And that still doesn't make it okay. If two people from our real reality told me they tried to murder each other, but now they love each other, I'd think they were crazy. \n\nHow would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\nAnd of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nOh and this all happened before *seventeen*...\n\n>That sounds like very toxic origins and I do not care about the circumstances as to why. It. is. still. Toxic. And what's worse is that it is never talked about or mentioned. Which makes it way worse. \n\nIt's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nYou act like they jumped into bed after Iron Country. There were years between chapter 699 and their marriage.\n\n>Sasuke was willing to die for Naruto. That doesn't mean anything. people keep bringing that up as if it means something. So is Sasuke in love with Naruto? Because according to your logic trying to die for someone automatically equates to romantic love, versus the very obvious dutiful platonic love it actually is. \n\nWow.\n\nAnd you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n>This is projection. You should reflect on your statement here and realize that you are the one that didn't pay attention.\n\nCool story, bro.\n\nHow about this...\n\nCan you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?",

                    "body": "> Who said it should be free from criticism?\n> The problem is that you are ignoring the greater context of the world these characters live in.\n\nI understand the context of the world they are in. Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

Yeah, they live in a shitty world, but you are using the entirety of events that take place in Naruto as justification for this one really stupid aspect of Naruto. it's jarring to me. Sasuke on multiple occasions had shown that he didn't value Sakura at all as a person, attempted to kill her, put her under a genjustu, ect. and Yet and still they wind up together without so much as a hitch. It's unbelievable. \n\n>Oh no!\n\n>I missed a word when taking 4 seconds to edit the comment I took 30 seconds to make! Clearly, I'm as dumb as you are. \n\nIt makes it hard to understand you when you keep butchering your sentences when coming up with your half-baked attempts at defending SasuSaku. Which btw is fiction that you seem to care deeply about despite claiming that I shouldn't be upset about it. \n\n>How would you feel if they told you one of them was psychically forced to watch his parents murdered thousands of times multiple times was tricked into killing one of the people he loves most in the world and then discovered that his entire life was a lie and the people he'd once sworn to serve were responsible for the deaths of everything he valued...\n\n>And of course, there's also the fact that he was influenced by the ancestor he was reincarnated from and fated to fall into darkness before he was ever born...\n\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't mitigate his actions. Sasuke was toxic throughout part II and Sakura loving him makes no sense. \n\n>It's never talked about or mentioned because it was the end of the series and there was a months long timeskip during chapter 699 and a decade long timeskip between 699 and 700.\n\nSo just sweep those problems under the rug, eh?\n\n>Wow.\n\n>And you were insulting my brain cells...\n\n\nYou have brain cells? Also, yeah, because talking to you is a chore. You keep making the same arguments again and again despite me knocking them down. And providing terrible defenses for something that doesn't even need to be defended. What a strange hill to die on. SasuSaku is a terrible relationship. It is forced and built on a toxic relationship that wouldn't work if these characters were real actual people. \n\n>Cool story, bro.\n\n>How about this...\n\n>Can you point to one time Sasuke complimented Sakura without looking it up?\n\nIrrelevant and doesn't absolve him of being incredibly toxic to Sakura, and Sakura being incredibly toxic to him. Do you have any quality arguments other than \"it's fiction\" and \"He had a tough life, it's okay that he tried to kill his wife\"?",

Or are you so dense that you don't understand that your opinions are shit and that you aren't saying anything worthy of discussion? I need to know? Are you a dumb ass?

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

I think, personally, that he didn't realize that the relationship was toxic. \n\n>Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them.\n\nAnd here is me quoted as saying as such. I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text.

And every time I've used \"healthy\" I've put it in quotes to highlight the sarcasm. So I ask you... Why are you arguing if you are going to keep claiming that you aren't arguing? And the reason I say that is every time I ask you to back up what you say or provide the clarification you claim that that isn't what you are saying, or that isn't what you mean, and then turn around and defend it. It's so disingenuous, fallacious, and completely asinine.\n\n \n>No you just legit don't seem to understand anything.\n\nI understand that you are a deceitful person who makes fallacious arguments and is unwilling to actually support what you say. I understand that you have no arguments and are now resulting to complaining about being straw-manned instead of defending yourself. I understand that you make disingenuous arguments and attempt to misdirect by claiming that you don't say the things you say while being in a text format where I can just copy and paste what you say.  I understand that you sir, or madam, are a dumbass. full stop.

Yes, you are. Are we done here? Are you going to keep coming back? Do you enjoy looking like an idiot? Am I dealing with a masochist who is enjoying all these insults? Or are you so dense that you don't understand that your opinions are shit and that you aren't saying anything worthy of discussion? I need to know? Are you a dumb ass? I'll be nice to you if you can just let me know if you are a dumb ass. I don't want to be here insulting someone who is mentally challenged. That ain't what I'm about.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

I think Kishimoto doesn't realize how his handling of relationships comes off or unintentionally showed how he views relationships. BTW, this still doesn't contradict anything I said. It doesn't contradict the above statement either. I hope this clears things up.",

I think, personally, that he didn't realize that the relationship was toxic. \n\n>Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them.\n\nAnd here is me quoted as saying as such. I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

Which is where we started. But then somehow it became about all writers everywhere. I think Kishimoto doesn't realize how his handling of relationships comes off or unintentionally showed how he views relationships. BTW, this still doesn't contradict anything I said.

I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

I think Kishimoto doesn't realize how his handling of relationships comes off or unintentionally showed how he views relationships. BTW, this still doesn't contradict anything I said.

And the reason I say that is every time I ask you to back up what you say or provide the clarification you claim that that isn't what you are saying, or that isn't what you mean, and then turn around and defend it.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

I think, personally, that he didn't realize that the relationship was toxic. \n\n>Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them.\n\nAnd here is me quoted as saying as such. I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text.

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged. Explain why calling their relationship toxic is idiotic without using the same argument I've already destroyed. Because as I've already stated. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it can't be judged or understood with our rules.",

The one where you state that they come from a fucked up world so their relationship is okay or that it can't be critiqued. And I remember telling you that that doesn't suddenly make their relationship okay or absolve it of criticism. Also, I disagree that they don't think \"like real-world humans\". They absolutely do. They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly. And I understand that I  respectfully disagree with your take. And I think we can just agree to disagree?

And how do you know he is highlighting toxic relationships? How do you know he disagrees? I think, personally, that he didn't realize that the relationship was toxic. \n\n>Sakura is made to engage in a very unhealthy relationship and Kishimoto intentionally or unintentionally creates the message that girls should put up with abusive men as long as they are attractive and that girls should base their lives, motivations, and personal identities around what their male peers think of them.\n\nAnd here is me quoted as saying as such. I don't personally know kishi. Nor do I know his values, but I am allowed to dissect his work and come to conclusions about what he wrote as long as it's supported by the text. And based on my readings of Naruto. His girl characters are terrible.",

Well I'll re-explain for the mentally challenged. Just because they exist in a fictional reality with magic, doesn't suddenly make Sakura's and Sasuke's relationship okay. And you need to explain why it's idiotic to think it's toxic. outside of the same tired argument of \"it's fiction and has different rules than real reality\" because that argument doesn't work. As I've stated prior. And I'll reiterate. Just because it's fiction, doesn't mean it can't be judged,  or understood by our rules. And not to mention the characters are still presented as being human with human emotions and thought processes. Which should shock no one because a human with human thought processes made it. So. to summarize because I understand these long paragraphs are hard to read for the mentally challenged.

They come from a combat-heavy reality sure, but naruto still goes through depression when Jiraiya dies. And Sasuke still seeks justice against all who wronged him. You know. Very real very human traits and reactions to the world around them. That's why I dislike the SasuSaku relationship so much. Because it feels like the characters lose that humanity and become autonomous units that are following a script. It breaks the immersion. So I think we can say I understand. I understand perfectly.
