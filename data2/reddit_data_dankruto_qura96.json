Even without the pedo part General Blue was highly misogynistic, narcissistic, and just all around cruel in the manga so it may have been just an evil person being evil. Plus OG Dragon Ball was a lot more comedic and vulgar. See Master Roshi who was extra creepy towards a 15-year-old Bulma, the many shots of Goku's dick (who was a wee little boy), or Goku obliviously molesting Bulma and Chi Chi. A lot of these elements were played as jokes so I don't think there was any intentional jab by making the gay character a pedo.",

I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them.

That was the *one* gay character that they decided to put in the series (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). That's how they chose to portray him. I think there's a strong argument that it is homophobic \\[because it is a) the only representation of a gay person in that series, and b) it reinforces pre-existing stereotypes of gay men\\], even if that may not have been how the writers intended it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction.\n\nYou could make an argument that Japan didn't have *enough* representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia. Shisui, by my recollection was portrayed as a positive character overall and it's possible, either due to personal biases, or more systemic reasons, the writers either didn't want (or didn't associate) those positive traits in a gay individual. Maybe they didn't want a gay character in their series point blank.\n\nBut anyway, the above isn't necessarily provable (not without more insight to the minds of the writers, which we don't have). My main point was just because Japan has representation of gay characters, it doesn't mean that representation is by any means positive. That's the point that I was trying to make clear in my response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nExactly. The issue is a lot more nuanced than that, which is why representations of gay people in anime (or Japanese media) doesn't translate to Japan being less homophobic.",

That's how they chose to portray him\n\nContext is important and in the grand scheme of OG Dragon Ball, I seriously doubt that Toriyama purposely wrote General Blue to be vile explicitly because he's gay. Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation. I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",

Like I said before -- the portrayal *itself* is still homophobic, even if the writer didn't intend to make it that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nTo be honest, I do have a broader issue with even straight people being depicted this way in a kids show, but that's a different issue. At least with straight people, you're getting that diversity of character -- not all straight characters in Dragon Ball were written to be cruel, vile pedophiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with\n\nFirst off, you've defined what I've done as \"over-analyzing\".. for what? Suggesting that it's homophobic that the only gay character in a TV show is presented as a pedophile? Come on, that isn't exactly a huge leap in logic to make.\n\nI don't think it does anyone a favour to dismiss discussion of these topics as \"over-analyzing\". Yes, it's a kids show, and sure, it may be a joke. But, shows like Dragon Ball have incredible cultural and social impact, and can help (in part) shape the way that kids and adults alike view the world. \n\nDismissing things like these as \"oh, it's just a joke\" ignores the issues surrounding the representation of minority groups in media, and ignores the impact that pop culture can have on broader society.\n\nNote that I never condemned the author himself for being homophobic (he could be, but I don't have enough information to conclude that), but rather the most I did was suggest that his portrayal of General Blue was homophobic.",

See Master Roshi who was extra creepy towards a 15-year-old Bulma, the many shots of Goku's dick (who was a wee little boy), or Goku obliviously molesting Bulma and Chi Chi.

I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction. Japan being homophobic isn't the reason why Shisui wasn't gay. \n\n>If anything, it reinforces it. Dragon Ball portrayed a singular gay character, and in an extremely negative light\n\nI mean that was like one character. I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them. I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.",

That was the *one* gay character that they decided to put in the series (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). That's how they chose to portray him. I think there's a strong argument that it is homophobic \\[because it is a) the only representation of a gay person in that series, and b) it reinforces pre-existing stereotypes of gay men\\], even if that may not have been how the writers intended it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction.\n\nYou could make an argument that Japan didn't have *enough* representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia. Shisui, by my recollection was portrayed as a positive character overall and it's possible, either due to personal biases, or more systemic reasons, the writers either didn't want (or didn't associate) those positive traits in a gay individual. Maybe they didn't want a gay character in their series point blank.\n\nBut anyway, the above isn't necessarily provable (not without more insight to the minds of the writers, which we don't have). My main point was just because Japan has representation of gay characters, it doesn't mean that representation is by any means positive. That's the point that I was trying to make clear in my response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nExactly. The issue is a lot more nuanced than that, which is why representations of gay people in anime (or Japanese media) doesn't translate to Japan being less homophobic.",

That's how they chose to portray him\n\nContext is important and in the grand scheme of OG Dragon Ball, I seriously doubt that Toriyama purposely wrote General Blue to be vile explicitly because he's gay. Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation. I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",

At least with straight people, you're getting that diversity of character -- not all straight characters in Dragon Ball were written to be cruel, vile pedophiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with\n\nFirst off, you've defined what I've done as \"over-analyzing\".. for what? Suggesting that it's homophobic that the only gay character in a TV show is presented as a pedophile? Come on, that isn't exactly a huge leap in logic to make.\n\nI don't think it does anyone a favour to dismiss discussion of these topics as \"over-analyzing\". Yes, it's a kids show, and sure, it may be a joke. But, shows like Dragon Ball have incredible cultural and social impact, and can help (in part) shape the way that kids and adults alike view the world. \n\nDismissing things like these as \"oh, it's just a joke\" ignores the issues surrounding the representation of minority groups in media, and ignores the impact that pop culture can have on broader society.\n\nNote that I never condemned the author himself for being homophobic (he could be, but I don't have enough information to conclude that), but rather the most I did was suggest that his portrayal of General Blue was homophobic.",

See Master Roshi who was extra creepy towards a 15-year-old Bulma, the many shots of Goku's dick (who was a wee little boy), or Goku obliviously molesting Bulma and Chi Chi.

I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction. Japan being homophobic isn't the reason why Shisui wasn't gay. \n\n>If anything, it reinforces it. Dragon Ball portrayed a singular gay character, and in an extremely negative light\n\nI mean that was like one character. I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them. I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.",

That was the *one* gay character that they decided to put in the series (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). That's how they chose to portray him. I think there's a strong argument that it is homophobic \\[because it is a) the only representation of a gay person in that series, and b) it reinforces pre-existing stereotypes of gay men\\], even if that may not have been how the writers intended it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction.\n\nYou could make an argument that Japan didn't have *enough* representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia. Shisui, by my recollection was portrayed as a positive character overall and it's possible, either due to personal biases, or more systemic reasons, the writers either didn't want (or didn't associate) those positive traits in a gay individual. Maybe they didn't want a gay character in their series point blank.\n\nBut anyway, the above isn't necessarily provable (not without more insight to the minds of the writers, which we don't have). My main point was just because Japan has representation of gay characters, it doesn't mean that representation is by any means positive. That's the point that I was trying to make clear in my response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nExactly. The issue is a lot more nuanced than that, which is why representations of gay people in anime (or Japanese media) doesn't translate to Japan being less homophobic.",

That's how they chose to portray him\n\nContext is important and in the grand scheme of OG Dragon Ball, I seriously doubt that Toriyama purposely wrote General Blue to be vile explicitly because he's gay. Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation. I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",

Like I said before -- the portrayal *itself* is still homophobic, even if the writer didn't intend to make it that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nTo be honest, I do have a broader issue with even straight people being depicted this way in a kids show, but that's a different issue. At least with straight people, you're getting that diversity of character -- not all straight characters in Dragon Ball were written to be cruel, vile pedophiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with\n\nFirst off, you've defined what I've done as \"over-analyzing\".. for what? Suggesting that it's homophobic that the only gay character in a TV show is presented as a pedophile? Come on, that isn't exactly a huge leap in logic to make.\n\nI don't think it does anyone a favour to dismiss discussion of these topics as \"over-analyzing\". Yes, it's a kids show, and sure, it may be a joke. But, shows like Dragon Ball have incredible cultural and social impact, and can help (in part) shape the way that kids and adults alike view the world. \n\nDismissing things like these as \"oh, it's just a joke\" ignores the issues surrounding the representation of minority groups in media, and ignores the impact that pop culture can have on broader society.\n\nNote that I never condemned the author himself for being homophobic (he could be, but I don't have enough information to conclude that), but rather the most I did was suggest that his portrayal of General Blue was homophobic.",

Even without the pedo part General Blue was highly misogynistic, narcissistic, and just all around cruel in the manga so it may have been just an evil person being evil. Plus OG Dragon Ball was a lot more comedic and vulgar. See Master Roshi who was extra creepy towards a 15-year-old Bulma, the many shots of Goku's dick (who was a wee little boy), or Goku obliviously molesting Bulma and Chi Chi. A lot of these elements were played as jokes so I don't think there was any intentional jab by making the gay character a pedo.",

Japan being homophobic isn't the reason why Shisui wasn't gay. \n\n>If anything, it reinforces it.

I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them. I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.",

That was the *one* gay character that they decided to put in the series (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). That's how they chose to portray him. I think there's a strong argument that it is homophobic \\[because it is a) the only representation of a gay person in that series, and b) it reinforces pre-existing stereotypes of gay men\\], even if that may not have been how the writers intended it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction.\n\nYou could make an argument that Japan didn't have *enough* representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia. Shisui, by my recollection was portrayed as a positive character overall and it's possible, either due to personal biases, or more systemic reasons, the writers either didn't want (or didn't associate) those positive traits in a gay individual. Maybe they didn't want a gay character in their series point blank.\n\nBut anyway, the above isn't necessarily provable (not without more insight to the minds of the writers, which we don't have). My main point was just because Japan has representation of gay characters, it doesn't mean that representation is by any means positive. That's the point that I was trying to make clear in my response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nExactly. The issue is a lot more nuanced than that, which is why representations of gay people in anime (or Japanese media) doesn't translate to Japan being less homophobic.",

That's how they chose to portray him\n\nContext is important and in the grand scheme of OG Dragon Ball, I seriously doubt that Toriyama purposely wrote General Blue to be vile explicitly because he's gay. Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation. I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",

At least with straight people, you're getting that diversity of character -- not all straight characters in Dragon Ball were written to be cruel, vile pedophiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with\n\nFirst off, you've defined what I've done as \"over-analyzing\".. for what? Suggesting that it's homophobic that the only gay character in a TV show is presented as a pedophile? Come on, that isn't exactly a huge leap in logic to make.\n\nI don't think it does anyone a favour to dismiss discussion of these topics as \"over-analyzing\". Yes, it's a kids show, and sure, it may be a joke. But, shows like Dragon Ball have incredible cultural and social impact, and can help (in part) shape the way that kids and adults alike view the world. \n\nDismissing things like these as \"oh, it's just a joke\" ignores the issues surrounding the representation of minority groups in media, and ignores the impact that pop culture can have on broader society.\n\nNote that I never condemned the author himself for being homophobic (he could be, but I don't have enough information to conclude that), but rather the most I did was suggest that his portrayal of General Blue was homophobic.",

See Master Roshi who was extra creepy towards a 15-year-old Bulma, the many shots of Goku's dick (who was a wee little boy), or Goku obliviously molesting Bulma and Chi Chi.

I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction. Japan being homophobic isn't the reason why Shisui wasn't gay. \n\n>If anything, it reinforces it.

I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them. I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.",

That was the *one* gay character that they decided to put in the series (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). That's how they chose to portray him. I think there's a strong argument that it is homophobic \\[because it is a) the only representation of a gay person in that series, and b) it reinforces pre-existing stereotypes of gay men\\], even if that may not have been how the writers intended it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction.\n\nYou could make an argument that Japan didn't have *enough* representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia. Shisui, by my recollection was portrayed as a positive character overall and it's possible, either due to personal biases, or more systemic reasons, the writers either didn't want (or didn't associate) those positive traits in a gay individual. Maybe they didn't want a gay character in their series point blank.\n\nBut anyway, the above isn't necessarily provable (not without more insight to the minds of the writers, which we don't have). My main point was just because Japan has representation of gay characters, it doesn't mean that representation is by any means positive. That's the point that I was trying to make clear in my response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nExactly. The issue is a lot more nuanced than that, which is why representations of gay people in anime (or Japanese media) doesn't translate to Japan being less homophobic.",

That's how they chose to portray him\n\nContext is important and in the grand scheme of OG Dragon Ball, I seriously doubt that Toriyama purposely wrote General Blue to be vile explicitly because he's gay. Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation. I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",

At least with straight people, you're getting that diversity of character -- not all straight characters in Dragon Ball were written to be cruel, vile pedophiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain.

Suggesting that it's homophobic that the only gay character in a TV show is presented as a pedophile? Come on, that isn't exactly a huge leap in logic to make.\n\nI don't think it does anyone a favour to dismiss discussion of these topics as \"over-analyzing\". Yes, it's a kids show, and sure, it may be a joke. But, shows like Dragon Ball have incredible cultural and social impact, and can help (in part) shape the way that kids and adults alike view the world. \n\nDismissing things like these as \"oh, it's just a joke\" ignores the issues surrounding the representation of minority groups in media, and ignores the impact that pop culture can have on broader society.\n\nNote that I never condemned the author himself for being homophobic (he could be, but I don't have enough information to conclude that), but rather the most I did was suggest that his portrayal of General Blue was homophobic.",

I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction. Japan being homophobic isn't the reason why Shisui wasn't gay. \n\n>If anything, it reinforces it.

I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them. I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.",

That was the *one* gay character that they decided to put in the series (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong). That's how they chose to portray him. I think there's a strong argument that it is homophobic \\[because it is a) the only representation of a gay person in that series, and b) it reinforces pre-existing stereotypes of gay men\\], even if that may not have been how the writers intended it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I very clearly implied that regardless of their attitude irl towards gays, it never stopped them from having LGBT characters in fiction.\n\nYou could make an argument that Japan didn't have *enough* representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia. Shisui, by my recollection was portrayed as a positive character overall and it's possible, either due to personal biases, or more systemic reasons, the writers either didn't want (or didn't associate) those positive traits in a gay individual. Maybe they didn't want a gay character in their series point blank.\n\nBut anyway, the above isn't necessarily provable (not without more insight to the minds of the writers, which we don't have). My main point was just because Japan has representation of gay characters, it doesn't mean that representation is by any means positive. That's the point that I was trying to make clear in my response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nExactly. The issue is a lot more nuanced than that, which is why representations of gay people in anime (or Japanese media) doesn't translate to Japan being less homophobic.",

That's how they chose to portray him\n\nContext is important and in the grand scheme of OG Dragon Ball, I seriously doubt that Toriyama purposely wrote General Blue to be vile explicitly because he's gay. Old school manga have very different styles and jokes compared with today's works and characters like General Blue is very typical of that time regardless of their sexual orientation. I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",

At least with straight people, you're getting that diversity of character -- not all straight characters in Dragon Ball were written to be cruel, vile pedophiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with\n\nFirst off, you've defined what I've done as \"over-analyzing\".. for what? Suggesting that it's homophobic that the only gay character in a TV show is presented as a pedophile? Come on, that isn't exactly a huge leap in logic to make.\n\nI don't think it does anyone a favour to dismiss discussion of these topics as \"over-analyzing\". Yes, it's a kids show, and sure, it may be a joke. But, shows like Dragon Ball have incredible cultural and social impact, and can help (in part) shape the way that kids and adults alike view the world. \n\nDismissing things like these as \"oh, it's just a joke\" ignores the issues surrounding the representation of minority groups in media, and ignores the impact that pop culture can have on broader society.\n\nNote that I never condemned the author himself for being homophobic (he could be, but I don't have enough information to conclude that), but rather the most I did was suggest that his portrayal of General Blue was homophobic.",

I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime.

See Master Roshi who was extra creepy towards a 15-year-old Bulma, the many shots of Goku's dick (who was a wee little boy), or Goku obliviously molesting Bulma and Chi Chi.

Japan being homophobic isn't the reason why Shisui wasn't gay. \n\n>If anything, it reinforces it.

I only cited mainstream examples and if you're going to use that logic then what about Sailor Moon portraying Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune as heroes or as another user pointed out, PuriPuri Prisoner the S-class hero from OPM? obviously there are a lot more examples of LGBT characters in anime and they came from many different spectrum, not necessarily evil or a pedo like General Blue.\n\nThis isn't even limited to anime. If you watch Japanese TV drama, there were tons of them with LGBT theme and main characters. The last 3-4 years is especially rife with them. I'm not saying Japan isn't homophobic but the issue is a lot more nuanced than that.",

I just don't think condemning the author for unintentionally coming off as homophobic is helpful in any way.\n\nIt's like that Dave Chapelle saga recently where things were blown out of proportion by people who went out of their way to feel offended even though the original issue was nowhere near as bad as they made it out to be, especially given the context of the entire performance. I apologize if I come off as dismissive and I fully understand the need for LGBT people to be acknowledged but sometimes (or a lot of times really) what's being presented is just what it is. A joke is a joke and an evil villain is just an evil villain. It will do no one a favor by trying to over analyze every single thing and purposely picking for flaws when there was none to begin with (unless they're being really explicit like JK Rowling)\n\n>You could make an argument that Japan didn't have enough representation of gay characters (in all the shows you listed it's what.. 1-2 people?), and that could be spurred by homophobia\n\nI mean gays *are* minorities even in the real world, at least the open ones. Even in American shows you normally wouldn't see a majority of gay characters unless the shows are about them. Like in Hollywood movies maybe you have 1-2 gay people as well and this is an industry that has been trying to be as woke as possible. The MCU is like the biggest franchise in the American entertainment industry spanning more than a decade and they have exactly 1 gay superhero that only came out a few days ago on Eternals.\n\nOn the other hand BL and yuri manga are also separate industries on their own so imo it doesn't make sense to link homophobia with the lack of representation in Japanese media because if anything, there's an overabundance of indulgence when it comes to same-sex portrayals. Whether you count that as positive representation is another matter entirely, one that would be linked to my previous paragraph. Again all of these is regardless of their irl attitude towards gay.",
