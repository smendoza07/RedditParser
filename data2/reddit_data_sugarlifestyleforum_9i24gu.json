    "body": "... something entirely unexpected.  This is a low content post, but just felt like sharing.  Months ago,  I was messaged by a 20-something POT.   The situation did not allow us to meet.  We finally met last night.  Went in with no expectations - just expecting a pleasant conversation.\n\nShe arrives, and I see a pleasant looking young woman.  Not an over-the-top head turner, but early indications of a super-fun personality.   I tell her I have about 40 minutes or so, since I have to go back to work.   Her and iI have some common travel experiences, and some commonality in demanding university education.  Everything just flows.\n\nI find out that she has no plans for the evening, and soon the conversation stretches past my deadline.   I have had some experiences that she wants to have, and she has not gotten loosened up enough to keep saying \u201cI f\u2019ing hate you\u201d.  That was a good sign.\n\nI give up on going back to work, because I can\u2019t tear myself away from the discussion.  She agreed to dinner.   It took over two hours to even talk about how an arrangement might work.    My first impressions about the personality were being validated.  We eventually conclude that we are going to see each other again.   She was super shy about the allowance discussion,  but it turned out we had the exact same PPM number in our head.  \n\nShe is getting super relaxed as time passes, and starts telling me that my biz success and such are hot.  My ego is feeling good.  The conversation starts to suggest that she could be ready for intimacy on our next date.  Eventually, I ask her if she needed a ride home.   She is kind of evasive, and I told her that not to worry if that made her uncomfortable.  Head off to washroom,  come back and tell her that I could pay her cab fare.  \n\nShe is still evasive, and then begins to ask what I am doing for the rest of the night.   It was so cute, as she could not really look at me when asking.  She wanted to head to a hotel, but I was totally unprepared since I did not have the allowance on me.  She persisted, saying she trusted that I was not going to screw her.  Maybe she was hinting about this before getting direct, but it never once occurred to me that we would get intimate that night.\n\nHead to the hotel, and we are intimate.  Afterwards, I just held her and caressed for at least 30 minutes.   She is effusive, saying that she can\u2019t remember when she was made to feel so beautiful and sexy.  This type of talk made me feel great.  I had to leave, but she decided to stay in the room for the night.\n\nSometimes SA delivers on the promise.  The fact that a guy in his sixties could spend such an amazing night with such an interesting and attractive young woman, kind of blows me away.  We are discussing our next date now.  ",

I think her attitude was great, sure, but my point was that this mindset doesn\u2019t work with every POT SD.  I can see scenarios where it would be totally natural, and some where that mindset would totally screw you as a SB.  I think this is much more so a reflection of how OP presents himself.  He must be a really wonderful man with a good nature.  ",
