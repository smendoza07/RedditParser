But the war itself only lasted a few days, less than a week.\n\nIt's why the power shift in Sakura is so wild. She goes from freaking out over what's going on and breaking down to stepping up to help Naruto and Sasuke as part of the new threeway deadlock. If that all happened over the course of like, 3 months that's insane. To go from panicking bystander to helping fight god in 3 months is the most accelerated shit of all time. And I like Sakura, but I also understand that shit is dumb as fuck.",

The idea was that you would be less likely to attack someone if you knew that a member of your family was married to them and possibly living with them as well. \r  \n\r  \nNow from what I\u2019ve read so far about the extended families of the three great unifiers of Japan (Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa), this strategy seems to have done absolutely jack shit to prevent alliances from breaking down, which makes sense considering that there was already a metric fuck ton of infighting going on within the clans themselves.  \r  \n\r  \nYeah, unlike in the Naruto Universe, the actual Japanese clans that fought in the Warring States era weren't exactly known for having the strongest familial bonds. In fact they were riddled with so many internal power struggles between siblings, cousins, and between parents and their children that I'm honestly at a loss for why anyone thought that becoming related through marriage would deter the exact same kind of backstabbing and betrayal that was already going on between family members who were related through blood. \r  \n\r  \nAnd these aren't like isolated incidents where every clan has that one jackass who ruins everything, it's more like a pattern of successive conflicts that spans multiple generations. Toss a rock into a group of clans and chances are you\u2019re going to end up hitting someone who\u2019s gotten caught in the crossfire of a dispute between people that they\u2019re related to at least once. \r  \n\r  \nHonestly the only thing that these political marriages seemed to accomplish was increasing the amount of people involved in these power struggles and making the process of trying to navigate through the ever shifting landscape of military alliances among the various warlords even more of an absolute nightmare. \n\nI can give you an example of these power struggles if you\u2019re interested.",

You have to remember that Obito's main plan was to gather the tailed beasts in relative secrecy and become the ten-tails jinchuriki with little fanfare as possible. He never wanted an all out war if possible(he still cultivated the 100,000 White Zetsu's just in case). It only happened once Sasuke and Nagato fucked up in capturing Killer Bee and Naruto. The only thing that caught Nagato off-guard was being reanimated. Due to Orochimaru being certifiably dead at that point and I don't think he imagined Kabuto of all people to ally himself with Obito and showing him the reanimation secrets.",

She goes from freaking out over what's going on and breaking down to stepping up to help Naruto and Sasuke as part of the new threeway deadlock. If that all happened over the course of like, 3 months that's insane. To go from panicking bystander to helping fight god in 3 months is the most accelerated shit of all time.

The idea was that you would be less likely to attack someone if you knew that a member of your family was married to them and possibly living with them as well. \r  \n\r  \nNow from what I\u2019ve read so far about the extended families of the three great unifiers of Japan (Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa), this strategy seems to have done absolutely jack shit to prevent alliances from breaking down, which makes sense considering that there was already a metric fuck ton of infighting going on within the clans themselves.  \r  \n\r  \nYeah, unlike in the Naruto Universe, the actual Japanese clans that fought in the Warring States era weren't exactly known for having the strongest familial bonds. In fact they were riddled with so many internal power struggles between siblings, cousins, and between parents and their children that I'm honestly at a loss for why anyone thought that becoming related through marriage would deter the exact same kind of backstabbing and betrayal that was already going on between family members who were related through blood. \r  \n\r  \nAnd these aren't like isolated incidents where every clan has that one jackass who ruins everything, it's more like a pattern of successive conflicts that spans multiple generations. Toss a rock into a group of clans and chances are you\u2019re going to end up hitting someone who\u2019s gotten caught in the crossfire of a dispute between people that they\u2019re related to at least once. \r  \n\r  \nHonestly the only thing that these political marriages seemed to accomplish was increasing the amount of people involved in these power struggles and making the process of trying to navigate through the ever shifting landscape of military alliances among the various warlords even more of an absolute nightmare. \n\nI can give you an example of these power struggles if you\u2019re interested.",

The idea was that you would be less likely to attack someone if you knew that a member of your family was married to them and possibly living with them as well. \r  \n\r  \nNow from what I\u2019ve read so far about the extended families of the three great unifiers of Japan (Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa), this strategy seems to have done absolutely jack shit to prevent alliances from breaking down, which makes sense considering that there was already a metric fuck ton of infighting going on within the clans themselves.  \r  \n\r  \nYeah, unlike in the Naruto Universe, the actual Japanese clans that fought in the Warring States era weren't exactly known for having the strongest familial bonds. In fact they were riddled with so many internal power struggles between siblings, cousins, and between parents and their children that I'm honestly at a loss for why anyone thought that becoming related through marriage would deter the exact same kind of backstabbing and betrayal that was already going on between family members who were related through blood. \r  \n\r  \nAnd these aren't like isolated incidents where every clan has that one jackass who ruins everything, it's more like a pattern of successive conflicts that spans multiple generations. Toss a rock into a group of clans and chances are you\u2019re going to end up hitting someone who\u2019s gotten caught in the crossfire of a dispute between people that they\u2019re related to at least once. \r  \n\r  \nHonestly the only thing that these political marriages seemed to accomplish was increasing the amount of people involved in these power struggles and making the process of trying to navigate through the ever shifting landscape of military alliances among the various warlords even more of an absolute nightmare. \n\nI can give you an example of these power struggles if you\u2019re interested.",
