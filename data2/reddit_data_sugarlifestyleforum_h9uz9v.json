    "body": "Okay this guy is cream of the salt, from a while back. \n\nWe agreed upon an allowance before and after M&G we went on a second date. He touched me A LOT while we were walking and I clearly said I was not comfortable. When we reached the hotel, I sticked to the community rule: sugar before sugaring. \n\nThus he said that (title) and started to criticize that my thighs are fat (I'm 5'4, 110lbs, in my country, Singapore, they worship skinny girls) (while still couldn't get his hands off me!!). I slammed the hotel door and left. \n\nOmg this just comes off as a huge loser I knew it. Though I didn't get scammed, it crushed my confidence yet again, fyi I had anorexia before due to body dysmorphia and finally gained back some weight. \n\nNow with our lockdown measures eased, I'm wondering if the sugar bowl is really for me as I am VERY weak in taking critics about my fats.",
