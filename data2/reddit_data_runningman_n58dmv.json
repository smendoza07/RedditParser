Some seem a bit disgruntled by that because they could have been the stars of stand alone eps. \nSometimes there were potentially awkward moments, particularly considering HaHas guests couldnt really qualify as celebs. But it just came together so well and it was so heartwarming.\n\nAlso one of the clear key times I really respected Jae Suks skill, where it was clear as day to see.\n\nThe producers gave them a really hard job - essentially made them MAKE the show interesting and also go smoothly, and Jae Suk took control at the helm masterfully, making it organised and giving every guest their due respect, whilst also highlighting the silliness of it all so they didnt take themselves so seriously, whilst also uniting them in teamwork.\n\nSome guests were a highlight - guests like Jackson, a young idol who people probably expected to just smile and sit there looking pretty - actively engaging to make things interesting, you could tell he was a star in the making right then. \n\nGiests from the past we were familiar with and it was great to see, and others completely new to us, and some that were new to entertainment who you could tell it was a big moment for and theyd never get this kind of opportunity again adn they were really excited - Ma Asung and the the theatre guy that especially says 'when would I get a chance to appear on running man again'? (Id have liked to see more actual celebs and not Haha pickups but thats me being mean, just the potential of other guests were so cool).\nBecause this was still when Running Man had this prestige and excitement to it. \n\nAnd their competitors were genuinely cool and impressive in their own right.\n\nurgh such a cool ep. \n\nActually one of my favourite 'bits' they did on RM was when they rang celebs spontaneously, usually through a challenge. And this was that x1000.\n\nThe actual last battle was probably the least intersting thing about it - jong kook being baited like a dumbarse took a lot of interest out of it.\n\nThe GFriend performance was a huge highlight too, Ive watched ti so many times, just because the celebs being genuinely excited for a personal impromptu performance and their reactions were so cool haha.",
