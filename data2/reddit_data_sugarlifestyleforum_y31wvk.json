    "body": "(An oldie but goodie)\n\nSo I am laying in a hotel bed, enjoying a pinot noir, while my SB lays on top of me. I am in my boxers with a large medallion around my chest, while she is wearing my shirt.  We were waiting for room service to bring us ice cream.\n\nThey were taking too long, so my SB gets impatient and wants to go to the shop down in the lobby.  I give her some cash, and she puts on my pants, then leaves.  While I am sitting there making dick jokes on reddit, I get a text from her.  You need a room key for the elevator, and she didnt have one (she took my pants, but not my wallet, of course). \n\nFolks, this is as close as life will ever be to sending me the bat signal. I leap off the bed, ready to heroically rescue my princess, when I realize... she. has. my. clothes.\n\nI look around the room. A pigmentally challenged gentleman such as myself is uh... **not** able to put on a sheet and especially not when he is looking for a beautiful non-white chick.  But I'm not going to let my girl down, so I did the very manly thing of putting on her dress.  \n\nThe dress did not come down far enough to cover my boxers, so I had to take those off.  She's... shorter than me, but I'm not huge so it wasn't a whole lampshade-and-pull-cord situation.  More like... a tasteful liberty bell.  Ding dong mofos. Ding. Dong.\n\nI head out to the elevator (my dudes, girls are lying, it's easy af to rock a little black dress).  It has been a long time since I surprised a SB who knows me well, but I definitely cannot adequately describe the look of shock on her face when I stepped off the elevator.  She asked me why I didnt use the hotel robe, which is an excellent question that sober me definitely would have thought of.\n\nI tried to respond to her as we got back onto the elevator, but that was when I realized *I forgot the room key.*  Because it was in my wallet. (This was the first time in my life that my wallet was not in my pants.)\n\nAnyway, the guys at the front desk of the dream Hollywood were super understanding.  Said it happens all the time.  Ladies, if your man hasn't been a cross dressing hero yet, he's overdue.\n\nWhen we got back to the room, the room service guy was waiting for us.  The way he looked at my hairy chest poking out of that dress... I know that look. I see it all the time when girls see me naked, and suddenly realize they are not into men.  I do want to apologize to that man's ex boyfriend, because I wasn't trying to turn him straight, but it's kinda my superpower to make lesbians and straight men everywhere I go.  I did give him a big tip though. (Cash, not what was poking out below my dress).",
