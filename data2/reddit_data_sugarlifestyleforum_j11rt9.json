As a seasoned SB I agree with most of what\u2019s been said. \n\nMy opinion is that if you haven\u2019t had the life experience and developed the emotional maturity to retain a healthy vanilla relationship, please take some time to do so before going into the bowl. If you have always had bad luck choosing vanilla guys to date, you\u2019re at even greater risk of getting into an unhealthy sugar relationship. Add the power differential and it\u2019s a possible recipe for disaster.\n\nSugar relationships can be amazing, even better than vanilla, but you need to be secure in yourself and capable of pursuing an equally emotionally stable SD.",

I also now have encountered 2 bad actors in the sense that they tried to have me hand over sugar via a transfer shop in order I can receive a large amount of sugar. The last guy approached me out the blue on SA and almost immediately without even speaking to me or video call, telling me he wanted to treat me. It was at first strange but I believed it until I realised the excessive amount he wanted to send and wanted me to send a fee of f i v e  h u n d r e a d. I was so angry and immediately reported him to SA sending over screen shots of his nonsense. To this day he's still emailing me and I give him zero response. Strangely enough the week prior I was watching a documentary on Samsung TV channel which was gritty about Internet cafes in Nigeria and how previlent scamming in the UK was. I was so horrified. They were laughing and simply said they needed to live too. They mainly stung much older women on vanilla websites looking for love. Several women gave away thousands to a man who didn't exist even losing their homes. One woman even took her life! Luckily the television team and police caught up with these crooks and exposed them on TV. That was a real eye opener for me as I just didn't think this was big business. I've only had 2 successful arrangements years ago. I've had dates but nothing much materialised. I think may be it's time I remove my profile from SA as I seem forgotten about or just receive relentless photo requests \ud83d\ude44as my main profile image is slightly obscured for safety and anonymity purposes.",

They should understand that they are safe to report and often are **not** *''the only one''* (girls might be surprised that he has already been reported). When it comes to a predator and getting a case opened at the police, or at least reporting it, is important because it can build a record of the offender or add to previous reports if he is repeat offender. This will discourage him from repeating or at least have him \"think twice\" about it.",

Not everybody means well. My best friend is not here with me anymore. And it wasn't even a stranger. We knew this person and we knew this person well both personally and professionally. She was not new. She was sweet and she was kind and she was good.\n\nAnd ladies, there are people out there that see those things and think that they have struck gold. They see an opportunity, not a person, not a mother or a sister or a daughter: an opportunity.  There are things you can do to be safer. Be careful volunteering things you have no idea how much you volunteer accidentally just chit-chatting with somebody. Not to mention, do you know how much Hell can be raised with having just your phone number? Think about these things. I would have gotten into the car with the man that killed her. Immediately, if not sooner I would have. He was our great protector. Until he wasn't. If you'd like to talk more with me about these things please feel free to inbox me. If you are new and you don't know what to do and you think that people in your life will judge you, then come talk to me. But don't go out there blind- compare being a sugar baby  to any other job: conduct yourself as a professional and see yourself as a professional. If you do this it's easy to see that the fact is every job has its it's hazards. Your employer prepares you for these hazards and and tells you what precautionary measures to take excetera. This is usually covered in training. These things being discussed ladies these things are our work place related hazards. Take them dead seriously, prepare accordingly, and if you don't know what to do in order to prepare yourself accordingly you're not ready to go out on the field alone without an experienced sugar baby with you. Ask for help. We ladies who are not new didn't get good at this by being dumb. You get dead by being dumb. You get spoiled by being clever and well prepared to deal with these things <3",

It would help a lot of people, and it would certainly save a lot of lives. I have thought about posting we're creating a list of recommended procedures and precautions to be taken by Lady such as ourselves prior to entering our world. That way somebody who is new has something to reference, and more importantly have someone to turn to when you don't know what to do say you get into a bad situation and you need help making sure you have the opportunity to learn from it. Having a more experienced person that you're comfortable speaking to and have a well established relationship with would be a lot better in this situation given the nature of our lifestyle here. I've not quite a few ideas but I admittedly rather shy around other babies\u2013 if anyone thinks this is a good idea has any feedback about this idea I would appreciate hearing what my fellow babies think <3",

I know I don't have to explain that to you ladies you know what I'm saying people hire dancers for bachelor parties all the time that doesn't mean they hook. But there wasn't a single one of us there that talked to us when we first came about how to survive our profession outside of the club. Maybe I should make a group just for this that way I'm not stepping on any of our lovely moderators toes?",

That doesn't help them. It isn't necessary to recount their errors and essentially slap them on.the head. They know. They want our support..Edit: for some who have physical and mental abuse we may be the only outlet they have to express themselves and, unlikely as it is, get our help. Browbeating is damaging.

Thing is, I'm 48, live in a one bedroom flat by a college, and drive a subcompact hybrid hatchback. I couldn't pose as a SD if I wanted to. \n\nAnd besides, the only time Dad beat my ass was for lying. I was never physically punished for any other transgression. It stuck, I have a hard time telling appropriate lies, never mind inappropriate ones. \n\nI rode out the Great Recession in college earning a mathematics degree, and ended up in a 20 year age gap LTR. God, I am so hooked, on her specifically but on younger women generally. \n\nThe only thing worse than being only 6 years into a solid career at 48 is not having a solid career at 48, so I'll take it. But the financial ramifications will follow me to the grave. \n\nSo I'm living like the early career professional I am, launching a podcast, playing board & video games, hand drumming, swing dancing before this damned plague hit, plus and critically, running 5k's and lifting. \n\nThere's a reason I think it would work, not least with the non-serious newbies who probably wouldn't go for a SR when push came to shove, but could be charmed into drinking Coronas and playing Pandemic. \n\nI know it's a pollution of the Bowl, but it's also the opportunity of a lifetime. I like to put it in Hero's Journey terms, absurd (or.. Absurd) as that sounds. Covid-19 shattered the Normal World. In this Special World, I'm sitting pretty as fuck. I live alone and have worked remotely my entire career. I burned my stimulus check on a mobile recording studio because outside is safe and content now sucks. Student loan suspension has allowed me to work up the best pad in my bank account I've ever had. I have no kids to worry about, and Dad is relatively safe in Wyoming and robust for his age. Plus, I invested in a barbell 2 years ago. \n\nI've so far Resisted the Call and your solid post is such a strong Call to Action that I might Cross the Threshold....and spend more time on seeking than Reddit. \n\nI'm absolutely sure that there are some fine younger women who would be down to hang out with a good looking older man who is adulting through this plague like a champ.",

I've been dating around for 3 weeks now and it did drain my social battery, but I love it. I am very wary of profiles that seem like scammers/ cfs and even if I get a slight red flag I end the conversation there. The dates are great, the sex is great, the things we talk about are interesting to me, I met some amazing men irl that I will hopefully get to see again. \n\nI have only recently turned 19 but I've been doing this online for about a year so I have some experience of when a profile screams that there's something not quite right. I am still willing to learn from other's experiences as well, even my own. I did hear from a few SD's that so many girls will not meet or even consider an irl SR, just thinking that a SD is an online fantasy that will just beg you to take his money. I personally love meeting new people and I've always preferred older men. So entering the bowl has definitely been one of the best decisions I ever made.  And this is my view on the issue, as a newbie 19yo SB.",

I also now have encountered 2 bad actors in the sense that they tried to have me hand over sugar via a transfer shop in order I can receive a large amount of sugar. The last guy approached me out the blue on SA and almost immediately without even speaking to me or video call, telling me he wanted to treat me. It was at first strange but I believed it until I realised the excessive amount he wanted to send and wanted me to send a fee of f i v e  h u n d r e a d. I was so angry and immediately reported him to SA sending over screen shots of his nonsense. To this day he's still emailing me and I give him zero response. Strangely enough the week prior I was watching a documentary on Samsung TV channel which was gritty about Internet cafes in Nigeria and how previlent scamming in the UK was. I was so horrified. They were laughing and simply said they needed to live too. They mainly stung much older women on vanilla websites looking for love. Several women gave away thousands to a man who didn't exist even losing their homes. One woman even took her life! Luckily the television team and police caught up with these crooks and exposed them on TV. That was a real eye opener for me as I just didn't think this was big business. I've only had 2 successful arrangements years ago. I've had dates but nothing much materialised. I think may be it's time I remove my profile from SA as I seem forgotten about or just receive relentless photo requests \ud83d\ude44as my main profile image is slightly obscured for safety and anonymity purposes.",

When it comes to a predator and getting a case opened at the police, or at least reporting it, is important because it can build a record of the offender or add to previous reports if he is repeat offender.

I have thought about posting we're creating a list of recommended procedures and precautions to be taken by Lady such as ourselves prior to entering our world. That way somebody who is new has something to reference, and more importantly have someone to turn to when you don't know what to do say you get into a bad situation and you need help making sure you have the opportunity to learn from it. Having a more experienced person that you're comfortable speaking to and have a well established relationship with would be a lot better in this situation given the nature of our lifestyle here. I've not quite a few ideas but I admittedly rather shy around other babies\u2013 if anyone thinks this is a good idea has any feedback about this idea I would appreciate hearing what my fellow babies think <3",

I know I don't have to explain that to you ladies you know what I'm saying people hire dancers for bachelor parties all the time that doesn't mean they hook.

Thing is, I'm 48, live in a one bedroom flat by a college, and drive a subcompact hybrid hatchback. I couldn't pose as a SD if I wanted to. \n\nAnd besides, the only time Dad beat my ass was for lying. I was never physically punished for any other transgression. It stuck, I have a hard time telling appropriate lies, never mind inappropriate ones. \n\nI rode out the Great Recession in college earning a mathematics degree, and ended up in a 20 year age gap LTR. God, I am so hooked, on her specifically but on younger women generally. \n\nThe only thing worse than being only 6 years into a solid career at 48 is not having a solid career at 48, so I'll take it. But the financial ramifications will follow me to the grave. \n\nSo I'm living like the early career professional I am, launching a podcast, playing board & video games, hand drumming, swing dancing before this damned plague hit, plus and critically, running 5k's and lifting. \n\nThere's a reason I think it would work, not least with the non-serious newbies who probably wouldn't go for a SR when push came to shove, but could be charmed into drinking Coronas and playing Pandemic. \n\nI know it's a pollution of the Bowl, but it's also the opportunity of a lifetime. I like to put it in Hero's Journey terms, absurd (or.. Absurd) as that sounds. Covid-19 shattered the Normal World. In this Special World, I'm sitting pretty as fuck. I live alone and have worked remotely my entire career. I burned my stimulus check on a mobile recording studio because outside is safe and content now sucks. Student loan suspension has allowed me to work up the best pad in my bank account I've ever had. I have no kids to worry about, and Dad is relatively safe in Wyoming and robust for his age. Plus, I invested in a barbell 2 years ago. \n\nI've so far Resisted the Call and your solid post is such a strong Call to Action that I might Cross the Threshold....and spend more time on seeking than Reddit. \n\nI'm absolutely sure that there are some fine younger women who would be down to hang out with a good looking older man who is adulting through this plague like a champ.",

They figure that means that they are paying them for their time and they are going to get their money's worth.. \n\nThis is why it is SO important to be clear and to the point about what is to be expected when y'all meet in person and always do PPM (regardless of how great the allowance idea sounds, at the beginning) for the first few dates to ensure it is even a match.. I would never want to agree to an allowance with someone I have never met and had sex with.. That means I am putting myself in a weak ass position with someone I JUST met and thinks I am his personal sex toy for the next 30 days...\ud83e\udd37",

When it comes to a predator and getting a case opened at the police, or at least reporting it, is important because it can build a record of the offender or add to previous reports if he is repeat offender.

It would help a lot of people, and it would certainly save a lot of lives. I have thought about posting we're creating a list of recommended procedures and precautions to be taken by Lady such as ourselves prior to entering our world. That way somebody who is new has something to reference, and more importantly have someone to turn to when you don't know what to do say you get into a bad situation and you need help making sure you have the opportunity to learn from it. Having a more experienced person that you're comfortable speaking to and have a well established relationship with would be a lot better in this situation given the nature of our lifestyle here. I've not quite a few ideas but I admittedly rather shy around other babies\u2013 if anyone thinks this is a good idea has any feedback about this idea I would appreciate hearing what my fellow babies think <3",

I know I don't have to explain that to you ladies you know what I'm saying people hire dancers for bachelor parties all the time that doesn't mean they hook.

Thing is, I'm 48, live in a one bedroom flat by a college, and drive a subcompact hybrid hatchback. I couldn't pose as a SD if I wanted to. \n\nAnd besides, the only time Dad beat my ass was for lying. I was never physically punished for any other transgression. It stuck, I have a hard time telling appropriate lies, never mind inappropriate ones. \n\nI rode out the Great Recession in college earning a mathematics degree, and ended up in a 20 year age gap LTR. God, I am so hooked, on her specifically but on younger women generally. \n\nThe only thing worse than being only 6 years into a solid career at 48 is not having a solid career at 48, so I'll take it. But the financial ramifications will follow me to the grave. \n\nSo I'm living like the early career professional I am, launching a podcast, playing board & video games, hand drumming, swing dancing before this damned plague hit, plus and critically, running 5k's and lifting. \n\nThere's a reason I think it would work, not least with the non-serious newbies who probably wouldn't go for a SR when push came to shove, but could be charmed into drinking Coronas and playing Pandemic. \n\nI know it's a pollution of the Bowl, but it's also the opportunity of a lifetime. I like to put it in Hero's Journey terms, absurd (or.. Absurd) as that sounds. Covid-19 shattered the Normal World. In this Special World, I'm sitting pretty as fuck. I live alone and have worked remotely my entire career. I burned my stimulus check on a mobile recording studio because outside is safe and content now sucks. Student loan suspension has allowed me to work up the best pad in my bank account I've ever had. I have no kids to worry about, and Dad is relatively safe in Wyoming and robust for his age. Plus, I invested in a barbell 2 years ago. \n\nI've so far Resisted the Call and your solid post is such a strong Call to Action that I might Cross the Threshold....and spend more time on seeking than Reddit. \n\nI'm absolutely sure that there are some fine younger women who would be down to hang out with a good looking older man who is adulting through this plague like a champ.",

So... They figure that means that they are paying them for their time and they are going to get their money's worth.. \n\nThis is why it is SO important to be clear and to the point about what is to be expected when y'all meet in person and always do PPM (regardless of how great the allowance idea sounds, at the beginning) for the first few dates to ensure it is even a match.. I would never want to agree to an allowance with someone I have never met and had sex with.. That means I am putting myself in a weak ass position with someone I JUST met and thinks I am his personal sex toy for the next 30 days...\ud83e\udd37",

They should understand that they are safe to report and often are **not** *''the only one''* (girls might be surprised that he has already been reported). When it comes to a predator and getting a case opened at the police, or at least reporting it, is important because it can build a record of the offender or add to previous reports if he is repeat offender. This will discourage him from repeating or at least have him \"think twice\" about it.",

She left a business establishment and went to a private residence or with the intent of going to a private residence and she thought our protector was going to escort her to do this because she was not a hooker contrary to popular belief. I know I don't have to explain that to you ladies you know what I'm saying people hire dancers for bachelor parties all the time that doesn't mean they hook. But there wasn't a single one of us there that talked to us when we first came about how to survive our profession outside of the club. Maybe I should make a group just for this that way I'm not stepping on any of our lovely moderators toes?",

When it comes to a predator and getting a case opened at the police, or at least reporting it, is important because it can build a record of the offender or add to previous reports if he is repeat offender.

I know I don't have to explain that to you ladies you know what I'm saying people hire dancers for bachelor parties all the time that doesn't mean they hook. But there wasn't a single one of us there that talked to us when we first came about how to survive our profession outside of the club.

I would never want to agree to an allowance with someone I have never met and had sex with..
