            "body": "Lose the hair. But heed my warning. When you get rid of the hair you will feel like your face looks chubbier. It's a shock going from all that majesty to being out in the open without any sort of framing or hair curtains to balance out the contour of your cheeks and chin. So, I'd say cut the hair off and go short or just rock a bald head. I think a buzz would look good, but also be prepared to get into some weightloss activities to get a leaner cut on the face. You can get noticeably leaner in two weeks if you apply yourself.",

That\u2019s right I said it. Your 2 on the sides and longer on the top is BORING! \n\nI would love to see you do an undercut, from the temples down do something short, maybe even down to bald. It\u2019s something you can keep up with at home or once a month cuts. Also if you learn a simple braid it would look really nice for the longer hair. \n\nAs for the beard keep it. But bring your cheek lines up a bit to help make your face have sharp line will make it look thinner.\n\nEdit; most importantly do some fun that makes you smile when you see it.\n\nEdit #2; Thank you guys for the kind words! My favorite thing to say at work is \u201cWe work with what we got\u201d that goes for thinning hair, weird cowlicks, different textures, whatever you got we\u2019ll find a cut that works for you. Push your stylist/barber more. If they are good and want to grow they will be down for doing something different. If not maybe it\u2019s time to find someone new.",

            "body": "I'm going to go against the grain here, and say that you can actually pull off a lot of styles with your hair - even long ones. It really depends on what you want to do.\n\nYour temples may be receding, but the front of your hairline still reaches a nice spot on your forehead, which is true of plenty of men. Your hair looks *much* better down in the bottom right pic, than it does pulled-back. I think tight ponytails is what's accentuating your thinning look.\n\nMy suggestion would be to first make sure you have a haircare routine that complements your hair; THEN decide if you want to go long, medium, or short afterwards. Look into volumizing shampoo and hairspray, as well as a round brush. I personally use Luxurious Volume by John Frieda, and It's A 10 Miracle Blowdry volumizer. What you want to do is wash your hair thoroughly in the shower, use just a little bit of conditioner everywhere EXCEPT your roots. And then once you towel-dry and your hair's damp, spray some of that nice miracle stuff into your roots and comb it through. Then comes the fun part:  blow dry your hair on medium-heat upside down first, then rightside up, and use the round brush to really add some thickness and height to your roots. You'd be amazed what you can do with just a round brush, product, and heat. Professionals have been doing this at salons for decades.\n\n\nI know that was a lot of hair-care advice and not so much style advice... but that's because I think people on this sub are sometimes too quick to recommend buzzing everything off, even in situations that aren't dire. Your hair actually looks quite nice, you just may not be wearing it right. So my two cents - follow all of the above, see the difference it makes, and then decide for yourself where you want to go from there. I personally think you'd rock an awesome medium length style with your locks on top messy, and short fade on the sides.",

Maybe some medium length haircut with more length at the top would work for you. Also you could try a different haircut each time you visit your barber. Like going to shoulder length hair first, then a month later some more shorter medium length hair cut with much shorter sides, then another month later maybe some good old undercut. I'd personally try to keep the front hair longer to cover up the receding hairline.",
