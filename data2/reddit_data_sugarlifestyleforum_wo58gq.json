    "body": "First post was here: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/wmk5t3/whats_a_nice_way_to_tell_a_sb_that_shes_going_to/\n\nWell, I took the suggestions to heart and sent her info about the restaurant I reserved and wanting to have some intimate time together.\n\nIn response I got an apologetic text saying that she was extending her trip by a day and couldn't see me on the 16th anymore. She knows that starting on the 17th I have a one-week business trip that I'm super stressed about. \n\nNormally this wouldn't be a big deal. She's visiting family. But since this is her second time canceling on me this month, third time in total, and she *only* told me that she couldn't make it after not responding for two days, it looks like the gravy train is no longer in service. I used to think it was a bit sleazy to be super upfront about sex as a SD, but I guess this is why you don't take things slowly in a SD/SB relationship.\n\nI just sent her a response: \"Got it. Have a safe trip.\" Blocked and done.\n\nI guess that's what I get for trying to respect boundaries and be a gentleman.\n\nEdit: sorry, please do not solicit me with offers in DMs. I live nowhere near anyone here.",

I can be gorgeous sensual and elegant lady with manners and I will still happen to meet men which come to date in designer sweatpants or spreading butter over bread and handing it over to me like if I am child. And yes I am talking from experience. Does it mean  I should lower my qualities to be more successful? No.",

At the beginning we talked about this being a physical relationship, and she said she was ok with that once she felt comfortable, then at like date 8 or 9 I asked again, and she said she was still down for a physical relationship. Shortly after that she got COVID (or so she said) but then she posts a Snapchat of her at a bar on trivia night, also a Sunday night, cause I could see the football game I was watching on TV on the TVs in the bar. So I ask her about the Snapchat video and she tells me she reposted an older video to help the guy that runs trivia out\u2026 so I called her on it and ended the arrangement. It was after this experience that I decided to 1. Always start with ppm and not an allowance and 2. Never do more that 2 platonic dates to start an arrangement, if they are not comfortable after that, I assume they never will be.",

There isn\u2019t a one size fits all for SRs. As long as you set boundaries on both sides, it will be successful. Of course, you also have to find people that respect each other, which is also hard to find in the bowl haha!

NEXT!\n\nWhy would you keep PAYING (key word, don't forget it) someone after 1-2 dates where there's nothing physical involved?\n\nIf you're good with supporting someone financially endlessly and with nothing in return, that's fine.

I don\u2019t mind if the SD abides by this rule and is up front about it- but now I see a lot of SDs that just expect it without communicating their want for intimacy quickly.\n\nMany of the old-fashioned SRs are quite lost on this sub. There isn\u2019t a one size fits all for SRs. As long as you set boundaries on both sides, it will be successful. Of course, you also have to find people that respect each other, which is also hard to find in the bowl haha!

They are every bit as vile for SDs as the Pushy obnoxious \"I shouldn't have to pay\" entitled types who pretend to be an SD are for SBs.  \n\nThe problem with BOTH of these nasty creatures is their sense of Entitlement - \"Well I DESERVE THIS\" - whatever it is they think they should have - and comes from a lack of concern for the other person   \n\"What? You expect to be treated like an actual Person?
