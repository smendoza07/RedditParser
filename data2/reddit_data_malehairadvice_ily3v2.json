Just pull out to desired length w fingers (vertically- like pointing from back to front) and try to cut blended layers.\n\nIn regards to the other comment, I always use a comb to do fades but not a specific kind of comb lol. You basically brush it in the hair in sideways so it sits at the roots and hold it flat at the neck pointing straight up and down. Then you buzz the hair off while holding the comb in place. Creates a quick fade with no need for guards or having to blend.  Since you hold it to the head at the neck, as you go up, the comb should be slightly further away from the scalp, which will make the hair up there longer. Look up clipper over comb by rum barber on YouTube for a visual",
