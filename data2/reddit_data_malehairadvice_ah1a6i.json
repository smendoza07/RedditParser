Just put a small amount of dry product like a wax on damp hair and then when you dry it, make sure you dry it in all directions (quiff it up, lie it all left and right and back down into a fringe) a few times which gives it that messy wavy look. \nSource: I\u2019ve had this hairstyle for about a year and it\u2019s a brilliant, low maintenance easy style.\nEnjoy!",
