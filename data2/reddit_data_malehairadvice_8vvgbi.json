I personally haven't.\n\nMatterial by Paul Mitchell (a matte clay) is my current go to product. It's available on Amazon. My hair isn't as thick as your original picture, and is also a tad shorter, but I get similar finishes and great hold with it. Maybe give it a look. Reformer by Paul Mitchell in my experience also has effectively the same consistency and hold, but a little more shine.",

You need a product that will add texture to the hair which won\u2019t be oil based. Something with a matte finish: I personally like hanz de fuko claymation. Put some product in your hair, just focus on getting product all over the top and don\u2019t think about placement. Then you would need a round brush and a blow dryer. Round brush the hair back and slightly to the side. Once it\u2019s dry you can start moving pieces to make it more like the picture. ",
