I noticed the rear light was out on her car so we drive to a car spares place, bought the replacement and I fixed it for her. I bought her a necklace (in the bisexual colours) for Valentine\u2019s Day instead of a lock to show she was owned by a dom. They are subtle things, with kink associated to them, but they do give the relationship spice. It\u2019s funny because she\u2019s come to business meetings with me and we look so believable when suited and booted (she is finishing her MBA) yet nobody knows the true dynamic between us.",

I was looking into doing some paid writing for them as a SB at one point and researching what they wanted and it was a ton of stuff like this. So it's already there. Or it was 5 years ago. I suppose things might have changed.",

I noticed the rear light was out on her car so we drive to a car spares place, bought the replacement and I fixed it for her. I bought her a necklace (in the bisexual colours) for Valentine\u2019s Day instead of a lock to show she was owned by a dom. They are subtle things, with kink associated to them, but they do give the relationship spice.

Show me a mainstream psychologist who thinks this dynamic is healthy.",

In our case: I gave her money to put in the donation box at a public beauty spot; bought her a happy meal at McDonalds; bought her a stuffed Nook toy from Animal Crossing (her favourite game). I noticed the rear light was out on her car so we drive to a car spares place, bought the replacement and I fixed it for her. I bought her a necklace (in the bisexual colours) for Valentine\u2019s Day instead of a lock to show she was owned by a dom. They are subtle things, with kink associated to them, but they do give the relationship spice. It\u2019s funny because she\u2019s come to business meetings with me and we look so believable when suited and booted (she is finishing her MBA) yet nobody knows the true dynamic between us.",
