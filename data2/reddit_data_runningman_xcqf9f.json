I enjoyed the dynamic of Kwangsoo, Jaesuk, and Yuri a lot better. Felt more natural, but of course it is a variety show and there are times they need to \"play up\" their reactions. I will admit both shows have times where it felt a bit long and dragged out. If you have the time, I suggest trying to watch episode 1 or 4 of The Zone, it seems like those are the episodes that people have enjoyed the most so far.",

I enjoyed the dynamic of Kwangsoo, Jaesuk, and Yuri a lot better. Felt more natural, but of course it is a variety show and there are times they need to \"play up\" their reactions. I will admit both shows have times where it felt a bit long and dragged out. If you have the time, I suggest trying to watch episode 1 or 4 of The Zone, it seems like those are the episodes that people have enjoyed the most so far.",
