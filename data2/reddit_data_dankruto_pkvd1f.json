If he wants to use a body, he consumes it in this form, and then the body becomes his. Any Kekkei Genkai or other physical talents become his in this body as well, which explains why he wanted Itachi/Sasuke (Sharingan). However, depending on the strength of the person consumed, the body starts to fall apart over time, forcing him to acquire a new body. Certain techniques that work on the soul, like the Third Hokage\u2019s Dead Demon Consuming Seal, can also disable his body, forcing him to switch to a new one. \n\nThis is separate from the thing he does where he spits himself out, and is only distantly related to the Curse Seals he uses on the Sound 5 and Sasuke. \n\nThis technique is \u201cimmortality\u201d in the sense that Orochimaru can be as young as his host body is, and as long as he has host bodies, he can keep switching indefinitely, as far as we can tell. He\u2019s still vulnerable to techniques like the Consuming Seal mentioned above, and if all his Curse Seals are destroyed along with his main body, he dies for good.",

I also remember now that when Sasuke killed him (as it looked back then) there were bodies of previous people he had consumed in that separate dimension/realm where Sasuke defeated him .
