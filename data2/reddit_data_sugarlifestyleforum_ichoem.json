    "body": "I had to end my arrangement with my wonderful SB. And damn it hurts.\n\nA couple of months ago she mentioned to me that she was looking at vanilla dating, I am not a very possessive man, so I gave her my blessing. We have been in a long term SR and we trust each other. So she found a lad and they have been dating full time for a couple of months. He does not know that she is my SB.\n\nI noticed the change in her over a couple of weeks and I could tell that she was truly smitten with him.\n\nIt was her birthday 2 days ago and today I saw her and we ended it.\n\nMy ex wife had an long term affair which ended our marriage 10 years ago and being cheated on is a huge trauma point for me. And over the past few weeks, I have been unable to not put myself in her boyfriend's shoes. I know how much it hurt me and I didn't want him to have to go through that pain.\n\nI adore her and I am truly heavily in love with my SB. I already miss her terribly and keep breaking into tears. I know I am making the right decision and that they should focus on each other without me in the picture. But holy hell this hurts.\n\nHow do people deal with this?",

That sounds strange and opposite to what others are saying but one vital stage of a sugar relationship is the ability to let them go on to another stage of their life.  Thanks to you, she knows the good aspects of a relationship and how to act to keep a healthy and loving relationship.  Some people will never get this education.  Be proud and happy you enriched someone\u2019s life like that.  It\u2019s part of the mentorship we can give to the SB.  \n\nAs some advice from one SD to another, one thing I like to do after leaving a deep relationship is to go on a trip.  I live in Asia so it\u2019s easy for me to bounce to another city and pick up with a new sugar or non-sugar relationship to heal the pain.  I also find writing my thoughts and memories in 2 emails helps the healing process.  One email is to me, and the other is the departing SB.  Even though I never send either email it allows me to formalize and digest the grief and pain.  Be well fellow SD.",

Not all those feelings and emotions are sad, and in fact, most of my writing was about the good memories.  Plus, I have always felt that the more detailed you can write into the note the better.\n\nAs an extra note.  The reason I added this experience is the OP mentioned that his SB was (or has already?) transitioned to her new beau and seemed he wanted minimal impact to let her move on.  If he sent the note, it might lead to bad feelings and make the situation worse.  If I were in his shoes, I would cut the cord and move on the best that I can.\n\nHope this helps clarify.",

Too often, we treat the ending of a SR like an end to a vanilla relationship and may get caught up in our own insecurities or unrealistic expectations.   Consciously having the ability to allow them to move forward to a different life stage is lost on most of us I'm sure.  But this message is an excellent reminder to all SD's.  One close SA friend told me something that I will always remember as my long term SR was ending last year-\"Be proud about how you leave things with her\".  We dont want to look back, 6 months, a year or 5 years from now and regret how things were handled.   Thanks for reminding me of this.  The truth is  that it applies to all relationships.",

I couldn't share my situation with friends or family so I began seeing a therapist which has helped.  It gets easier but slowly.  A SR is a relationship and it can get intense so we have to be prepared to deal with the fallout when it ends. It's a loss so you need to grieve and process it.  Takes time but will get better.  Move on slowly and have fun.  Dont compare her to your next SR or the one after that.  Just enjoy the new experiences as they come with low expectations.   Best of luck to you.",

She moved to a new place and ran into a guy she met when she was 15 and he was 18; she had a huge teen crush on him and was FWB for a year after she graduated college. He ran into her and could not believe how confident and self-assured she had become. She told him she had no interest in him because of how he treated her in the past, and he basically groveled at her feet for six weeks before she took him back. She is Ukrainian and her parents married at 17 and are upset that she wasn't even dating anyone at 25. So they are now very serious and I went through what you went through - we loved each other - and I felt dumped, etc. - but now I am talking online to a few amazing women and trying to decide who will be my next and taking pride in how I impacted here life.  PS - a note she sent me after the end has become my new \"marketing material\" - she thinks it's great.",

The reason I added this experience is the OP mentioned that his SB was (or has already?) transitioned to her new beau and seemed he wanted minimal impact to let her move on.  If he sent the note, it might lead to bad feelings and make the situation worse.  If I were in his shoes, I would cut the cord and move on the best that I can.\n\nHope this helps clarify.",

Too often, we treat the ending of a SR like an end to a vanilla relationship and may get caught up in our own insecurities or unrealistic expectations.   Consciously having the ability to allow them to move forward to a different life stage is lost on most of us I'm sure.  But this message is an excellent reminder to all SD's.  One close SA friend told me something that I will always remember as my long term SR was ending last year-\"Be proud about how you leave things with her\".  We dont want to look back, 6 months, a year or 5 years from now and regret how things were handled.   Thanks for reminding me of this.  The truth is  that it applies to all relationships.",

Plus, I have always felt that the more detailed you can write into the note the better.\n\nAs an extra note.  The reason I added this experience is the OP mentioned that his SB was (or has already?) transitioned to her new beau and seemed he wanted minimal impact to let her move on.  If he sent the note, it might lead to bad feelings and make the situation worse.  If I were in his shoes, I would cut the cord and move on the best that I can.\n\nHope this helps clarify.",
