Having your scalp exposed to air and sun, greatly helps these rashes, but who the hell wants to shave their head. \n\nThese rashes flourish under long hair, that\u2019s why when you cut your hair short again they\u2019re there. Once you cut the hair short, they recede. \n\nThis is also an autoimmune disease. We can only treat, not cure it. \n\nEdit: this is kinda somewhat common for men,\n\nSymptoms: \n\n\u2022mean fuckin dandruff (**clumps** of it sometimes come out) \n\n\u2022those rashes on OP\u2019s head\n\n\u2022rashes/crust can show on chest, face; and for me, my damned ears\n\n\u2022 itchy scalp\n\n",

The only thing that ever worked long term was straight sulfur powder. You can order some on Amazon. The one I have is by a company called Duda. Just sprinkle it on and message it in. Let it set for a few hours and then shampoo it out. Repeat daily for a few weeks. Sulfur has been used for centuries to kill all sorts of skin fungi and yeasts.",
