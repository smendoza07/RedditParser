It's more or less a pornography category, that's it.  Even then, it's more about humiliating another man in front of him.\n\nIt doesn't work out so well in the real world.  You have a lot of reading material available about guys who \"didn't think she would leave me\" or \"she stopped looking at me the same.\"\n\nJust wanted to make sure you know that it's not a normal thing so talk it over with your SO if you're about to cuck him and expect appreciation",

Who are also more likely to be sexually into being dominated by both women or larger \"equipment\". So you have a point there. \n\nWhat's funny is that men are conditioned to be more assertive while women are raised to be the opposite and soft-spoken. Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

I have seen many people on this sub who weren't even aware of this until posts like these started popping up. So I think its better to not post and not talk about it at all. The trend will automatically die. The people who enjoy Hinata X Raikage dont even deserve our attention in the first place. Just let them do what they do. Its not going to change the fact that Hinata is a really pure character and that NaruHina is canon. NaruHina is my fav ship in the series and they both are wholesome.",

I don't need to explain how Sasuke kept saying \"just give up and let me cut you down\". But its romantic to some people. They also didn't get the point that Naruto just wanted to bring Sasuke out of darkness. They see this as \"development\" somehow. And can you stop using the word cry? No one is crying about it.

I won't judge. And you know how they are showed? Hinata cheating on Naruto, NTR, Hinata wanting a real man and other such garbage.

No he didn't he just said you'll grow into a beauty. I'm not mad. Why does everyone liking this ship say words like mad or cry? Harmless? You even know what they show in their fanarts? Gathered info from the comments, they show Hinata willingly going to Raikage to get fuckrd by her bcz Naruto's size is small. She willingly goes to him and invites him over to cheat on Naruto. They show she needs a real man to satisfy her and such other garbage and shit talks. Who wouldn't call them mental? And the ones who I've argued, they say they self insert as the Raikage.",

It's more or less a pornography category, that's it.  Even then, it's more about humiliating another man in front of him.\n\nIt doesn't work out so well in the real world.  You have a lot of reading material available about guys who \"didn't think she would leave me\" or \"she stopped looking at me the same.\"\n\nJust wanted to make sure you know that it's not a normal thing so talk it over with your SO if you're about to cuck him and expect appreciation",

So you have a point there. \n\nWhat's funny is that men are conditioned to be more assertive while women are raised to be the opposite and soft-spoken. Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

I don't need to explain how Sasuke kept saying \"just give up and let me cut you down\". But its romantic to some people.

I just go all out during these anger outburst and start saying offensive and Hurtful things without even thinking, it has happened before a lot, in real life, I said some hurtful things to my sister because I was angry at my teacher for scolding me for no reason, and started to write slurs on reddit after someone was calling me stupid just cuz I didn't get the joke and got banned from reddit for 3 days, it happened again and got banned for a week, it's just like, my angers just waits for me to explode and then I end up hurting those who didn't deserve it at all, I get what you are saying and trust me, I am trying my best, but it just doesn't work no matter how hard I try. some cunt just dmed me saying he only ships Himawari and Raikage, triggered me and I'm outbursting out irl. it's just that no matter what happens I will always end up hurting someone, it's either gonna be a family member, a friend or someone on the internet, I just feel like a volcano just storing it all up and then hurting someone, but while that happens, I slowly hurt myself from the inside too, I just wish to be able to be contain this explosion and I will try my best not to do these outbursts that often.",

I don't need to explain how Sasuke kept saying \"just give up and let me cut you down\". But its romantic to some people. They also didn't get the point that Naruto just wanted to bring Sasuke out of darkness. They see this as \"development\" somehow. And can you stop using the word cry? No one is crying about it.

Even then, it's more about humiliating another man in front of him.\n\nIt doesn't work out so well in the real world.  You have a lot of reading material available about guys who \"didn't think she would leave me\" or \"she stopped looking at me the same.\"\n\nJust wanted to make sure you know that it's not a normal thing so talk it over with your SO if you're about to cuck him and expect appreciation",

Who are also more likely to be sexually into being dominated by both women or larger \"equipment\". So you have a point there. \n\nWhat's funny is that men are conditioned to be more assertive while women are raised to be the opposite and soft-spoken. Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

I just go all out during these anger outburst and start saying offensive and Hurtful things without even thinking, it has happened before a lot, in real life, I said some hurtful things to my sister because I was angry at my teacher for scolding me for no reason, and started to write slurs on reddit after someone was calling me stupid just cuz I didn't get the joke and got banned from reddit for 3 days, it happened again and got banned for a week, it's just like, my angers just waits for me to explode and then I end up hurting those who didn't deserve it at all, I get what you are saying and trust me, I am trying my best, but it just doesn't work no matter how hard I try. some cunt just dmed me saying he only ships Himawari and Raikage, triggered me and I'm outbursting out irl. it's just that no matter what happens I will always end up hurting someone, it's either gonna be a family member, a friend or someone on the internet, I just feel like a volcano just storing it all up and then hurting someone, but while that happens, I slowly hurt myself from the inside too, I just wish to be able to be contain this explosion and I will try my best not to do these outbursts that often.",

I don't need to explain how Sasuke kept saying \"just give up and let me cut you down\". But its romantic to some people. They also didn't get the point that Naruto just wanted to bring Sasuke out of darkness. They see this as \"development\" somehow. And can you stop using the word cry? No one is crying about it.

Who are also more likely to be sexually into being dominated by both women or larger \"equipment\". So you have a point there. \n\nWhat's funny is that men are conditioned to be more assertive while women are raised to be the opposite and soft-spoken. Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

I don't need to explain how Sasuke kept saying \"just give up and let me cut you down\". But its romantic to some people. They also didn't get the point that Naruto just wanted to bring Sasuke out of darkness. They see this as \"development\" somehow. And can you stop using the word cry? No one is crying about it.

Why does everyone liking this ship say words like mad or cry? Harmless? You even know what they show in their fanarts? Gathered info from the comments, they show Hinata willingly going to Raikage to get fuckrd by her bcz Naruto's size is small. She willingly goes to him and invites him over to cheat on Naruto. They show she needs a real man to satisfy her and such other garbage and shit talks. Who wouldn't call them mental? And the ones who I've argued, they say they self insert as the Raikage.",

So you have a point there. \n\nWhat's funny is that men are conditioned to be more assertive while women are raised to be the opposite and soft-spoken. Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

Its shown to be funny but many viewers didn't liked it. And he hit on Konan? No he didn't he just said you'll grow into a beauty. I'm not mad. Why does everyone liking this ship say words like mad or cry? Harmless? You even know what they show in their fanarts? Gathered info from the comments, they show Hinata willingly going to Raikage to get fuckrd by her bcz Naruto's size is small. She willingly goes to him and invites him over to cheat on Naruto. They show she needs a real man to satisfy her and such other garbage and shit talks. Who wouldn't call them mental? And the ones who I've argued, they say they self insert as the Raikage.",

Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

If you want to ship a man kidnapping a child and then talking her eyes out or if you want to go on the darker alternate route, use her as a slave bcz of her Byakugan, then feel free to do so. I won't judge. And you know how they are showed? Hinata cheating on Naruto, NTR, Hinata wanting a real man and other such garbage. Again I won't judge you if you like these things that are happening to a couple(Naruto and Hinata)who is happily married. \n\nYup very fonni",

He made a kid Naruto transform into a girl for his enjoyment, didn't he? He hit on Konan, who he literally has a father-daughter relationship with. You mad at that too and think Jiraiya fans are mentally ill, or is it only when it happens in an alternate universe fanmade fiction/artwork of a harmless ship?",

Its shown to be funny but many viewers didn't liked it. And he hit on Konan? No he didn't he just said you'll grow into a beauty. I'm not mad. Why does everyone liking this ship say words like mad or cry? Harmless? You even know what they show in their fanarts? Gathered info from the comments, they show Hinata willingly going to Raikage to get fuckrd by her bcz Naruto's size is small. She willingly goes to him and invites him over to cheat on Naruto. They show she needs a real man to satisfy her and such other garbage and shit talks. Who wouldn't call them mental? And the ones who I've argued, they say they self insert as the Raikage.",

I don't need to explain how Sasuke kept saying \"just give up and let me cut you down\". But its romantic to some people. They also didn't get the point that Naruto just wanted to bring Sasuke out of darkness. They see this as \"development\" somehow. And can you stop using the word cry? No one is crying about it.

Why does everyone liking this ship say words like mad or cry? Harmless? You even know what they show in their fanarts? Gathered info from the comments, they show Hinata willingly going to Raikage to get fuckrd by her bcz Naruto's size is small. She willingly goes to him and invites him over to cheat on Naruto. They show she needs a real man to satisfy her and such other garbage and shit talks. Who wouldn't call them mental? And the ones who I've argued, they say they self insert as the Raikage.",

So you have a point there. \n\nWhat's funny is that men are conditioned to be more assertive while women are raised to be the opposite and soft-spoken. Which leads to even submissive men being weirdly pushy, which is a huge problem in the BDSM community regarding newcomers. \n\nPersonally, I believe it's the fault of porn. If you think about it, the majority of pornography is watching some dude have intercourse while you masturbate. There's no way that doesn't fuck with the developing brains of young teenagers.",

He made a kid Naruto transform into a girl for his enjoyment, didn't he? He hit on Konan, who he literally has a father-daughter relationship with. You mad at that too and think Jiraiya fans are mentally ill, or is it only when it happens in an alternate universe fanmade fiction/artwork of a harmless ship?",

You even know what they show in their fanarts? Gathered info from the comments, they show Hinata willingly going to Raikage to get fuckrd by her bcz Naruto's size is small. She willingly goes to him and invites him over to cheat on Naruto. They show she needs a real man to satisfy her and such other garbage and shit talks. Who wouldn't call them mental?
