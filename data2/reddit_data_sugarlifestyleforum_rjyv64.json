    "body": "So, I\u2019m 31 SD I make 6 figures and have been on the site for a while. Well a few months ago I contacted a gorgeous 26 year old SB on there. We immediately hit it off we texted for about a week until we were finally able to meet. When we did she came over and I cooked for her and the whole night was really magical. Long story short, cut to now and we\u2019re living together. I was able to get her added to my health insurance by us becoming domestic partners. I get to surprise her with jewelry, Victoria secret, and pretty much anything else she wants almost weekly. So, now she\u2019s the first thing I see in the morning and last thing I see at night. We\u2019re doing the holidays together visiting family that are out of state and things couldn\u2019t be better! So for everyone reading it does happen, you can find real success on the site!",

Although in retrospect, I've been talking with some 40+ SBs lately, which puts me in a similar situation as you in that they are SBs who are in the same age range as the women I date (only hotter! lol).  It has occurred to me that where I am not at all open to a 24-year-old moving in with me and transitioning to a vanilla relationship, I might be open to that as a possible outcome with a 40+ year old",

If you are 31, not addicted to anything, employed, not living in your parents basement, it kind of makes you a catch anyway. You should be able to attract a woman you're approximate age without the addition of an allowance.  Many younger women look for older men because they don't want to date somebody their own age that is pretty much homeless.\n\n I guess I don't really get it...  My own vanilla relationship is with somebody who is about 15 years my junior.",

Marriage and divorce generally are considered matters reserved to the states rather than to the federal government.\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/divorce-abroad/divorce-abroad-legal.html\n\n>a divorce decree issued in a foreign country generally is recognized in a state in the United States on the basis of comity (Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163-64 (1895), where both parties had notice of the divorce proceeding and an opportunity to be heard within these proceedings. Under the principle of comity, a divorce obtained in a foreign country under the circumstances described above generally will be recognized by states within the United States. States also may consider the jurisdictional basis upon which the foreign decree is founded and may not recognize the foreign divorce if the court is not satisfied that at least one party was domiciled in the country at the time of the divorce.\n\n>Divorce impacts eligibility for and distribution of federal benefits. Accordingly, the U.S. Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, and Internal Revenue Service have made determinations regarding the validity of foreign divorces based on the laws of the state of residence applicable with respect to claims for benefits. For Social Security issues, please visit their website. Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",

Marriage and divorce generally are considered matters reserved to the states rather than to the federal government.\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/divorce-abroad/divorce-abroad-legal.html\n\n>a divorce decree issued in a foreign country generally is recognized in a state in the United States on the basis of comity (Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163-64 (1895), where both parties had notice of the divorce proceeding and an opportunity to be heard within these proceedings. Under the principle of comity, a divorce obtained in a foreign country under the circumstances described above generally will be recognized by states within the United States. States also may consider the jurisdictional basis upon which the foreign decree is founded and may not recognize the foreign divorce if the court is not satisfied that at least one party was domiciled in the country at the time of the divorce.\n\n>Divorce impacts eligibility for and distribution of federal benefits. Accordingly, the U.S. Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, and Internal Revenue Service have made determinations regarding the validity of foreign divorces based on the laws of the state of residence applicable with respect to claims for benefits. For Social Security issues, please visit their website. Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",

If she moves to Canada for a year, she can file for divorce there.\n\nAny prenup is out the window, and they won't treat it any differently from any other marriage.\n\n>these things are factors\n\nThey're really not.\n\n>I have these things covered.\n\nYou don't.",

Marriage and divorce generally are considered matters reserved to the states rather than to the federal government.\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/divorce-abroad/divorce-abroad-legal.html\n\n>a divorce decree issued in a foreign country generally is recognized in a state in the United States on the basis of comity (Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163-64 (1895), where both parties had notice of the divorce proceeding and an opportunity to be heard within these proceedings. Under the principle of comity, a divorce obtained in a foreign country under the circumstances described above generally will be recognized by states within the United States. States also may consider the jurisdictional basis upon which the foreign decree is founded and may not recognize the foreign divorce if the court is not satisfied that at least one party was domiciled in the country at the time of the divorce.\n\n>Divorce impacts eligibility for and distribution of federal benefits. Accordingly, the U.S. Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, and Internal Revenue Service have made determinations regarding the validity of foreign divorces based on the laws of the state of residence applicable with respect to claims for benefits. For Social Security issues, please visit their website. Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",

Marriage and divorce generally are considered matters reserved to the states rather than to the federal government.\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/divorce-abroad/divorce-abroad-legal.html\n\n>a divorce decree issued in a foreign country generally is recognized in a state in the United States on the basis of comity (Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163-64 (1895), where both parties had notice of the divorce proceeding and an opportunity to be heard within these proceedings. Under the principle of comity, a divorce obtained in a foreign country under the circumstances described above generally will be recognized by states within the United States. States also may consider the jurisdictional basis upon which the foreign decree is founded and may not recognize the foreign divorce if the court is not satisfied that at least one party was domiciled in the country at the time of the divorce.\n\n>Divorce impacts eligibility for and distribution of federal benefits. Accordingly, the U.S. Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, and Internal Revenue Service have made determinations regarding the validity of foreign divorces based on the laws of the state of residence applicable with respect to claims for benefits. For Social Security issues, please visit their website. Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",

Marriage and divorce generally are considered matters reserved to the states rather than to the federal government.\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/divorce-abroad/divorce-abroad-legal.html\n\n>a divorce decree issued in a foreign country generally is recognized in a state in the United States on the basis of comity (Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163-64 (1895), where both parties had notice of the divorce proceeding and an opportunity to be heard within these proceedings. Under the principle of comity, a divorce obtained in a foreign country under the circumstances described above generally will be recognized by states within the United States. States also may consider the jurisdictional basis upon which the foreign decree is founded and may not recognize the foreign divorce if the court is not satisfied that at least one party was domiciled in the country at the time of the divorce.\n\n>Divorce impacts eligibility for and distribution of federal benefits. Accordingly, the U.S. Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, and Internal Revenue Service have made determinations regarding the validity of foreign divorces based on the laws of the state of residence applicable with respect to claims for benefits. For Social Security issues, please visit their website. Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",

Marriage and divorce generally are considered matters reserved to the states rather than to the federal government.\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/divorce-abroad/divorce-abroad-legal.html\n\n>a divorce decree issued in a foreign country generally is recognized in a state in the United States on the basis of comity (Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 163-64 (1895), where both parties had notice of the divorce proceeding and an opportunity to be heard within these proceedings. Under the principle of comity, a divorce obtained in a foreign country under the circumstances described above generally will be recognized by states within the United States. States also may consider the jurisdictional basis upon which the foreign decree is founded and may not recognize the foreign divorce if the court is not satisfied that at least one party was domiciled in the country at the time of the divorce.\n\n>Divorce impacts eligibility for and distribution of federal benefits. Accordingly, the U.S. Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, and Internal Revenue Service have made determinations regarding the validity of foreign divorces based on the laws of the state of residence applicable with respect to claims for benefits. For Social Security issues, please visit their website. Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",

Generally, federal entities apply the law of the state of residence of the beneficiary in question.\n\nFor example, in the UK, civil partnerships:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/end-civil-partnership\n\n>How to end your civil partnership\n>You must send paperwork to a court to ask for permission to end your civil partnership.\n\n>Separate from the paperwork, you and your ex-partner may need to work out:\n\n>arrangements for looking after any children\n>child maintenance payments for any children\n>***You also need to divide your money and property. There\u2019s a deadline if you want to make this legally binding.***\n\n>You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree about children, money and property and the reasons for ending your civil partnership.\n\nMost countries have rules about who can file for divorce in their country.\n\nMost countries set the line as one of the partners living in that country for a year to be eligible for divorce there.",
