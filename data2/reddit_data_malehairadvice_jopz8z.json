You are among the fortunate minority of men who look better without hair and not having hair is easy!\n\nThose who maybe don\u2019t have the best head shape but are losing their hair can still look great with a shaved head, and will ALWAYS look better than they do with the famous bald guy who keeps the side hair and doesn\u2019t have a damn strand on the top left due to MPB. \n\nAt 30, I doubt I ever go bald since I have no signs of MPB now and no family history through either parent. If i do, better believe i\u2019ll shave my noggin. \n\nI may shave my head one day to test it out and if it looks even half as good as yours does i\u2019ll just keep doing it! So easy :)",

I can grow a full beard without any bare spots or issues, so I think that if I let my beard be at a medium length so that shaving my hair would be more subtle than if I were to shave my face cleanly and then shave my head. I usually have a beard but keep it short and \u201cprofessional\u201d the majority of the time. It is easier grooming a shorter beard than a longer one, but without hair to style and condition etc, only my beard would beard any attention! Haha",

I can grow a full beard without any bare spots or issues, so I think that if I let my beard be at a medium length so that shaving my hair would be more subtle than if I were to shave my face cleanly and then shave my head. I usually have a beard but keep it short and \u201cprofessional\u201d the majority of the time. It is easier grooming a shorter beard than a longer one, but without hair to style and condition etc, only my beard would beard any attention! Haha",
