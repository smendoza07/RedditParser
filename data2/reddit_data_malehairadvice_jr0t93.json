Hair is receding a bit (which is okay), but slicking / pulling it back accentuates it and makes it look more receded than it actually is. Cut it short, blow-dry after showering, and use some American Crew fiber to give it body, play with just parting it and combing it up a bit. You could even try some minoxidil on top if you wanted for extra growth.\n\n**Positive criticism:** Oh dude, *definitely* the Bateman look / first picture. You look great clean-shaven, 10 years younger, and it sounds like you prefer it anyway. Bateman is handsome as F and so are you.",

I would only go 2-3 days max without shaving and just felt like seeing how it turns out. I'm sure my fivehead doesn't help with the rest though.",

So a crew cut is what I would suggest since your hairline is like mine.  Also just a stubble kept trimmed to about 3mm looks best as long as it\u2019s kept trimmed.  Also, a good workout routine does wonders.  For stress and the way you look.  We don\u2019t notice but it helps a lot.",
