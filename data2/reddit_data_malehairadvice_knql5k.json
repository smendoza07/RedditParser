He always pushed it back when it was about half way wet, raked a little mousse through it and then popped a beanie on until it was dry. It gave his hair so much volume and kept it styled pretty much until he washed it again. He just pushed it back and popped on the beanie to sleep and it held overnight too.  Your hair looks great but I think a little volume would really take it up a notch and if you dont want to spend alot (or really any) time styling it you might want to try this!",

If your wanting volume I recommend blow drying it not completely dry just a little damp, after that put a headband over pushing the top up which will help a lot with volume. Atleast that\u2019s what I do and works great. If you want a bit of texture or wave maybe put a sea salt spray after you blow dry which should help. That\u2019s what I did when I was at that length.

Look for ceramic heating elements or a deonizer setting. This will prevent frizz caused by static. Learn how to do a blowout. There are youtube videos all over. I spend about 15 minutes doing a blowout every time I wash my hair and thats it. I use very little product, mainly a heat protectant spray, and generally just finger comb my hair in the morning.\n\nI use a sporenette ss-150 brush and an infinity pro conair blow dryer. \n\nSome basic tips:\n1) make sure your ends dry before your root\n2) your hair should be mostly dry before you run brush through it, the blow dryer will detangle most of your hair\n3) if your hand doesn't cramp, you aren't doing it properly\n4) keep that brush twisting and keep that heat on the outside of the brush\n5) direct the heat so it runs from root to tip, do not blow heat up the Shafter or you'll lift your cuticles. \n6)MOST important tip is work your hair in all directions, this will give it lift and bounce while removing things like a cowlick or an unwanted part. After you work your roots all over, then focus on heating and styling. \n\nThe first few times you'll spend about 45 minutes trying to figure out what you're doing because you're hands are trying to work in a mirror, but after a few times you'll get better at it.",
