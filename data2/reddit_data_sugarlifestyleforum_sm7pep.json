    "body": "I just have to get this off my chest! I just started in this community a few days ago. It's been fine, but one thing really bothers me. When women express caution about being sexually intimate, in a private environment, meeting someone quickly, etc., I've seen them tend to get some backlash from the men. I've seen so many things like \"If you don't sleep with him after a couple dates he'll think you're a scammer\", \"tell him what you can offer him intimately in your profile\"... some men complain about the women on this site secretly being escorts or something of that nature, and then get upset when a girl is not offering sex for money. \n\nAdditionally, many men here act like being scammed by a woman is the most evil thing someone could do. I agree that it's not right, and the feeling of being cheated is terrible. I feel for you. I wouldn't do that to someone. However, some men seem to forget that women are literally afraid of being kidnapped, assaulted or worse when they meet a man. A man is afraid of losing his money. A woman is afraid of losing her life. \n\nAll I'm saying is that obviously, be careful with who you're giving to- both men and women. Don't give too early. Learn who you're really talking to. However, money lost is something that can be replaced. In fact, most men on the site are there specifically to show off their abundant money. So, while I feel for anyone that gets scammed, I can't come to feel that the fear of losing money compares at all to the fears a woman deals with. \n\nTelling women that they're scammers or going to be dropped if they don't have sex right away is pressuring them to have sex, which isn't okay. Maybe it's just me, but I've sensed a general undertone of men insinuating that they have it worse than the women. I'd have to disagree. \n\nI'm not trying to start an argument with anyone or create drama. I just wanted to express my opinion on the entire SD/SB process. Everyone experiences life differently and has different values. I just want everyone to be safe. Not all men are terrible, not all women are innocent. This is just my own rant.",

There  is a reason a good percent of SDs on SA do not have pictures up and still do well.. and why the same can not be said for SBs.\n\nAlso this does have to a gender component .. logically it makes sense that a person who has been on the earth longer would have more to lose than someone who hasn\u2019t\u2026 The one who has been a live longer has had more time to collect stuff, and relationships.",

And I don\u2019t understand how you would get the impression that OP thinks SBs are the only ones taking a risk- she literally points out herself that they are taking a risk of being scammed. \n\nHer point is very simple- The fear of losing money is not equal to the fear being raped or killed! And the fear of being exposed for being a sugar daddy is also not equal to the fear of being raped and murdered! You can, in fact, compare the two, and it\u2019s not gaslighting, especially when she specifically says that there are risks for men, they just ARE NOT AS GRAVE AS THE RISKS FOR WOMEN! And as others have mentioned, these risks apply to all women, SB or not. Like you said yourself, the risks SDs assume is for the \u201csuperficial fun\u201d of having a SB. Those risks are optional. If you are married and know you have a lot to lose by sugaring, then you can in fact choose not to do it. But sugaring or not, women will face these risks by doing the most mundane tasks. \n\nAnd hard disagree that men have \u201cmore to lose\u201d because they have been around longer and possibly built more relationships and obtained more stuff. So you\u2019re really gonna argue that if someone has more material things to lose, losing those things by being scammed or exposed is a bigger deal than losing your LIFE? And I don\u2019t even agree with the logic that being around longer and accumulating more means that you somehow have a more meaningful, rich inner life than someone who hasn\u2019t. The life of a wealthy man is not more valuable than the life of someone who has less, because they are wealthy? All people have equal value by virtue of being people! \n\nThis post isn\u2019t controversial because OP doesn\u2019t live in reality- OP is very in tune with reality! It shouldn\u2019t be controversial at all. It is not some hot take to say that it is worse to lose your life than to be scammed. What is not clicking here??? Would you rather be out some money, or fucking dead? JFC",

The American CDC  research put the percentage of female homicide victims who were killed by an intimate partner as well over 50%.  Most likely that excludes wannabe intimate partners.  For the male the probability of being killed by a female intimate partner approaches lottery odds. \n\nThere's a need for SD's to recognize this issue AND not only respect reasonable conditions in arrangements but also to compliment the SB or her good judgement.   deBecker advised females to test and note that close males understand that \"no\" is a complete sentence and needs no explanation, apology or flexibility.......",

At no point did I consider that to be pressuring a woman into sex ... but reading your post, I wonder how much my comments/perspective might contribute to that feeling.\n\nI do not have clear answer or definitive conclusion - I am adding the detail more as a confirmation that you have given me reason to think about how I approach the sugar bowl.",

If the woman gives the sugar and the man turns out to be a scammer, she's out that same X amount of dollars *and* has been sexually assaulted because she wouldn't have given consent without the PPM. Also agree that men in all walks of dating could be better served by empathizing what it must be like for women, who are generally in much more physical danger if they end up dating the wrong person and act accordingly to make her feel safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Telling women that they're scammers or going to be dropped if they don't have sex right away is pressuring them to have sex, which isn't okay.\n\nTelling a woman she is a scammer if she won't have sex right away isn't necessarily accurate. BUT, telling an aspiring SB on SLF she is likely going to be expected by any SD to have sex within the first 2-3 dates is actually accurate, and is not pressuring them into having sex; it is illuminating the facts of how things work in the bowl. She can make her own choices whether its for her or not.",

Men AND Women complain about the scammers.

On SA men have to report their annual income and net worth. And I searched through SA this morning and didn't see any men showing off their cars, planes, watches.\n\n>Telling women that they're scammers or going to be dropped if they don't  \n have sex right away is pressuring them to have sex, which isn't okay. \n\nAs an SB, I have not had this happen to me.\n\n>Maybe it's just me, but I've sensed a general undertone of men insinuating that they have it worse than the women.\n\nIn my opinion, men have it better than women in the Sugar Bowl. Women have it better than men in vanilla dating.",

And I feel like many SDs - esp here on this forum - agreed that the threat to a woman is far greater. \n\nThere are great SDs here and there are not great SDs here. Same with SBs. But also in an earlier post the idea that SRs in general have such a wide range. That it\u2019s impossible to do a one size fits all. \n\nMost any real SD will have no issue having a few unpaid platonic dates for any SB that they are interested in and needs that. Some of us want that connection first. \n\nBut you will see some SBs agree with that and a decent amount posting here that think they should be paid for them regardless, even when it\u2019s them who want more time to connect. \n\nAlso I think a lot of pressure comes from within. Not saying all. But look at Tinder Swindler. She was offered a first date private airplane ride to wherever and she said yes. No real vetting. Just pack and go because the carrot was great. I do think there are a decent amount of SBs out there that either need/want the money or gifts and pressure themselves to have sex because they won\u2019t get that without it. (Mostly) -\n\n guys who say hey, want to extend this M&G and start now - should more often than not be nexted if you refuse and they keep pushing. \n\nMeet in public for the first time - how many posts have we all seen : he wants me to meet at hotel, should I? No. No you shouldn\u2019t. Unless you are willing to have sex. He wants me to come over to his place for the first meet, is this a good idea? No. No it isn\u2019t. He wants me to drive down this deserted road to meet, is that cool? \n\nAre there terrible terrible terrible things that happen even if you have taken every precaution? Yes. And that\u2019s the absolute hell that women face every single day as a possibility. And that\u2019s way way more than being scammed. Scammed still sucks. But not that. \n\nIf your need/wants/shiny things outweigh your level headed thinking trouble will most likely follow. \n\nMost guys get scammed because they are thinking with their dicks at that moment. And giving faith in someone they do not know at all. \n\nAnd almost every story I\u2019ve read here about a woman feeling pressured - and that sucks and no matter what they did they do NOT ever deserve to be - but almost every story there is a moment when the SB should have passed on the meet or the chat or the invite.",

We do advocate for a public M&G, with NO expectation of intimacy on that date. We also preach that it\u2019s ok for a FEW platonic dates to get to know one another better. But by then both parties should be ready and willing to move forward with an adult relationship. \n\nIf you\u2019re lobbying for the old \u201csend me $ upfront to prove you\u2019re real\u201d well that\u2019s going to get shot down 11 times out of 10. That IS what scammers push for every time. So no, we aren\u2019t going to be comfortable with pissing away money in the hopes you\u2019re the one in a million not trying to scam us. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right, monetary loss is minor compared to physical/mental. Doesn\u2019t mean we will be ok with it. \n\nI get your underlying reason for the post, but read some more here. You\u2019ll find a good group for the most part.",

Specific actions or opinions are called out, never all SBs.

But my experience in the Sugar Bowl is that sex occurs on either the first or second date. Vanilla dating is typically sex on 3rd or 4th date. Just because a woman doesn't have sex after a couple dates does not make her a scammer, that thought never crosses my mind.\n\n>However, some men seem to forget that women are literally afraid of being kidnapped, assaulted or worse when they meet a man.\n\nAs a male I'm afraid of being kidnapped, physically assaulted and sexually assaulted. I've been physically assaulted once in my life and it was by a **female Sugar Baby**.\n\n>In fact, most men on the site are there specifically to show off their abundant money. \n\nYou did not state which online website you are referring to. \n\nFor [Seeking.com](https://Seeking.com), the site **requires** men to state their annual income and net worth. It is my personal preference that those numbers be removed from that website. And the vast majority of men do not show off their luxury items.\n\nFor [MillionaireMatch.com](https://MillionaireMatch.com), there are some men and women that show off their luxury items (Mercedes cars seem to be popular). However it is debatable if that website is a sugar dating website.\n\nI'm aware of 3 people who have been killed in the Sugar Bowl.\n\n1. The first is a Sugar Baby who injected her Sugar Daddy with heroine and he overdosed and died. This was caught on videotape on his yacht. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/16/justice/prostitute-yacht-killing/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/16/justice/prostitute-yacht-killing/index.html)\n\n2. The second is a Sugar Baby who killed her Sugar Daddy by shooting him in the head. She was convicted of first degree homicide in Pennsylvania.\n\n[https://levittownnow.com/2019/02/01/jury-convicts-former-stripper-for-murder-of-sugar-daddy/](https://levittownnow.com/2019/02/01/jury-convicts-former-stripper-for-murder-of-sugar-daddy/)\n\n3. In 2019, a Sugar Baby in Florida died after a drug overdose and I knew this Sugar Baby. A Sugar Daddy she met in a hotel room may have helped her overdose. This story never made it to the media.",

Presumably you'll extend the same courtesy to me.\n\nI think that men and women are on a more or less equal footing in what you describe. Neither men nor women have a monopoly on perpetrating violence. Remember that the average age of an SD is significantly greater than that of an SB. That does add some balance. And there's plenty of younger-woman-on-older-man violence. Society (at least in the U.S.) is at a place where women have the upper hand once the police are involved, they're much more likely to be believed than a man who denies wrongdoing. My father was the victim of such a woman, who punched him in the face, then called the police claiming to be the victim.\n\nThe bottom line is that *everyone* in the bowl should use reasonable caution. If you're in any way uncomfortable, get out. Listen to your gut. Don't worry about whether or not you're overreacting. If it doesn't feel right, it's not.",

Since it was the only thing he had access to (I forgot to change the password during his tirade of nasty insults for whatever I didn't agree with), he turned it into a business account and went wild with features. I can chuckle about it now, but I cant imagine what else he couldve done had I just let him have free reign over my life.

I know we grew up in the same generation and at least were taught similar values. Also, the younger the man, the more emphasis has been placed on being respectful to women. Men today in their 50s and 60s were raised with their mothers who were born in the 30s and 40s. Those women were commonly raised to be homemakers, submissive and compliant with their husband. That\u2019s the home that these older men grew up in, so when he hears a young woman point things out and talk back to him, he gets upset. It\u2019s for that reason that I feel more anxious to express my views to older men because they were raised in a time when women are supposed to view themselves as somewhat lesser.

That said, there's no question that this guy was an overbearing, ill-mannered boor. His parents apparently never taught him manners, among other things like treating everyone with respect.\n\nActually, that raises an interesting question, at least in my mind. Is behavior like that attributable to older men being domineering, arrogant, manipulative, or is it equally (or more) attributable to a profound lack of basic manners?",

Which in turn pushes away the more legitimate SDs; while the guys who are pseudo scamming (just looking to hook up with women, single PPM dates) aren't going to really be pushed away.\n\n> Maybe it's just me, but I've sensed a general undertone of men insinuating that they have it worse than the women\n\nMy experience is that it is really only 1-2 users here that act like this - and the occasional trash that drifts in from other shitty subs.  (which I will not name).  \n\nPersonally I think this sub would be 100x better if we all stopped with the clap backs, and stopped trying to compare which is worse.  At the end of the day - both sides (SB, SD) have ended up at the very extreme - dead by their partner.  Both sides have their own risks, and concerns.  And trying to compare - does not help ANYONE.\n\n(for the record, I agree women face larger risks.  But I've never seen a post/topic where discussing this comparison added any value to the conversation - and instead just helped it devolve into a shit shoe).",

If you are uncomfortable with that, I understand, and thank you for taking the time to talk to me.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'll let you in on a secret: when a woman feels pressured or like she's being viewed as an object for pleasure, like you don't care about who she actually is, she will back away. If you are respectful, give her options and space to appropriately determine the reality of the situation and her safety, while always giving her the clear opportunity to leave.... the chances of you getting lucky skyrocket.* \n\nPersonally, if a man clearly asks for my consent and seems genuine in his concern for my safety, I legitimately want to sleep with him. It's the difference between a man pressuring a woman and a woman desiring a man.",

I merely pointed out that men are also at risk physically, but never said it was an equal risk.  To be honest, even after texting, phone conversations, video chats, and a platonic meet and greet, when I am at the point when I am alone with a woman, I can't say that the thought still never crosses my mind for a very brief moment that she could pull out a weapon and do Lord knows what.  The good news is that I'm an excellent  character judge and the outcomes have always been successful, and mutually so.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you were to look at my post history, you'd see that more often than not I will support an SB I who believe makes a valid point and disagree with an SD who I think is wrong.  \n\nI noticed the other day in your biography you wanted people to review that you are a law student.  You should know then that if you are making an argument, the burden of proof is on you, the accuser.  \n\nBe that as it may, as you demanded, I did \"the work.\" I expanded all the 170+ replies and this is what I found using Ctrl+F on your key words.  I also used single words like \"murdered\"  \"murder\" \"easier\" and \"easy\" to facilitate finding your alleged comments.  One caveat, I cannot account for anyone who deleted their post after your comment.  Here is what I could find, and believe me, I tried.\r  \n1.  \"women have it easier\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n2.  \"most women won't be raped or murdered\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n3.  \"risk is worth the reward\u201d - Words taken out of context.  The commenter said, \"If you don't think \\*the risk is worth the reward\\* to engage in a sugar relationship, you absolutely shouldn't do it.\"  \r  \n\r  \nIf I missed something, prove me wrong.  I stand by my earlier comment that you\u2019ve grossly mischaracterized the attitudes of the vast majority -- repeat vast majority -- of SDs who have expressed in this Forum that they do not wish to pressure any girl into having sex against her will or do them any harm.

For example, I have come to understand that in some relationships, abusive behavior can take years to show up.\n\nYes, I agree that concern for a SB's safety and getting murdered, raped, or trafficked is exponentially worse than any financial loss an SD may incur from being rinsed.\n\nThis is why stages and establishing trust is important. \n\nVetting should never be 2 SA messages and then a private M&G at the SD's house.  But it happens and the odds of something unfavorable happening is higher.\n\nA few text messages on a real platform; a phone call; a video call; a M&G in a public place. Each step of the way, these vetting tactics should reduce the chance of an awful incident occurring. It's not 100% for sure. At some point, the concern of getting kidnapped, has to be diluted.\n\nI think what we want to be careful of - and I feel OP's stance is leaning this way - is that \"since SBs are more likely to put their personal safety at risk, then SDs should be ok with losing money or getting scammed.\" It's not the case.\n\nI go to great lengths to ensure any POT SB feels comfortable; doesn't feel like she is going to be a murder victim; or feels like she will be pressured into sex or raped.\n\nMoney can be replaced, yes, but the feeling of betrayal and getting scammed does not go away. Just because it is less severe than experiencing a rape or kidnapping doesn't mean it should be excluded from the well-being equation of the Bowl or any social relationships.\n\nI think where things tip is when women use the \"well you could be a serial killer\" line and require cash to offset the concern.\n\nIt's also odd because plenty of SBs that express concerns with meeting a stranger do just that on Tinder each day and without the serial killer rhetoric. \n\nI'd argue that older men have more to lose than younger men. Even if an older man is a sophisticated PUA/scammer/manipulator/rapist, getting caught when you are 45 or 50 has far more dire consequences than when you are 20. Whether it be business exposure, family concerns, or the fact that a court is more likely to say \"oh boys being boys\" when the man is 20 vs 50.\n\nEveryone's well-being, men and women, should be treated respectfully and with care and authenticity.",

In fact, the person most likely going to kill you will be someone you know, not a stranger.\n\nIn fact, women are more likely going to face violence instead. So less of a murder and more of a rape attempt. Horrible? Yes. But a lot less than dead.\n\nHowever, if you live your life in fear that someone will do something horrible to you then you probably can't live your life. You wouldn't be able to date anyone much less having a SR.\n\nI blame it on the opaque nature of SR. The men want to keep their privacy out of necessity so it's very inconvenient for women to dig for information. At the same time, you can't expect to shell out money for scammers to exploit because somehow that makes things safer for women (it's not).",

And I don\u2019t understand how you would get the impression that OP thinks SBs are the only ones taking a risk- she literally points out herself that they are taking a risk of being scammed. \n\nHer point is very simple- The fear of losing money is not equal to the fear being raped or killed! And the fear of being exposed for being a sugar daddy is also not equal to the fear of being raped and murdered! You can, in fact, compare the two, and it\u2019s not gaslighting, especially when she specifically says that there are risks for men, they just ARE NOT AS GRAVE AS THE RISKS FOR WOMEN! And as others have mentioned, these risks apply to all women, SB or not. Like you said yourself, the risks SDs assume is for the \u201csuperficial fun\u201d of having a SB. Those risks are optional. If you are married and know you have a lot to lose by sugaring, then you can in fact choose not to do it. But sugaring or not, women will face these risks by doing the most mundane tasks. \n\nAnd hard disagree that men have \u201cmore to lose\u201d because they have been around longer and possibly built more relationships and obtained more stuff. So you\u2019re really gonna argue that if someone has more material things to lose, losing those things by being scammed or exposed is a bigger deal than losing your LIFE? And I don\u2019t even agree with the logic that being around longer and accumulating more means that you somehow have a more meaningful, rich inner life than someone who hasn\u2019t. The life of a wealthy man is not more valuable than the life of someone who has less, because they are wealthy? All people have equal value by virtue of being people! \n\nThis post isn\u2019t controversial because OP doesn\u2019t live in reality- OP is very in tune with reality! It shouldn\u2019t be controversial at all. It is not some hot take to say that it is worse to lose your life than to be scammed. What is not clicking here??? Would you rather be out some money, or fucking dead? JFC",

The American CDC  research put the percentage of female homicide victims who were killed by an intimate partner as well over 50%.  Most likely that excludes wannabe intimate partners.  For the male the probability of being killed by a female intimate partner approaches lottery odds. \n\nThere's a need for SD's to recognize this issue AND not only respect reasonable conditions in arrangements but also to compliment the SB or her good judgement.   deBecker advised females to test and note that close males understand that \"no\" is a complete sentence and needs no explanation, apology or flexibility.......",

Since it was the only thing he had access to (I forgot to change the password during his tirade of nasty insults for whatever I didn't agree with), he turned it into a business account and went wild with features. I can chuckle about it now, but I cant imagine what else he couldve done had I just let him have free reign over my life. Year before last I ran into two more guys with the same demeanor, im just glad it was pre-meet they lost their shit. Some will also say its \"dominating\" to save face but I steer clear of them as well.",

Anyone who thinks women actually have the upper hand when a man is older is crazy. For me, when I\u2019m with someone my own age, I\u2019m going to call them out on any bullshit right away. I know we grew up in the same generation and at least were taught similar values. Also, the younger the man, the more emphasis has been placed on being respectful to women. Men today in their 50s and 60s were raised with their mothers who were born in the 30s and 40s. Those women were commonly raised to be homemakers, submissive and compliant with their husband. That\u2019s the home that these older men grew up in, so when he hears a young woman point things out and talk back to him, he gets upset. It\u2019s for that reason that I feel more anxious to express my views to older men because they were raised in a time when women are supposed to view themselves as somewhat lesser. While hopefully most of those values didn\u2019t stick, they still linger, and older men get upset when they\u2019re contradicted by a young woman. That\u2019s when they get violent and lash out.",

Of course the number of people I know personally is a tiny fraction of the population.

That said, there's no question that this guy was an overbearing, ill-mannered boor. His parents apparently never taught him manners, among other things like treating everyone with respect.\n\nActually, that raises an interesting question, at least in my mind. Is behavior like that attributable to older men being domineering, arrogant, manipulative, or is it equally (or more) attributable to a profound lack of basic manners?",

Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1635092/\n\n>A total of 215,273 homicides were studied, 77% of which involved male victims and 23% female victims.\n\nMen are 3 times more likely to be murdered.\n\n>In contrast to men, the killing of a woman by a stranger was rare (RR = 0.18).\n\nOnly 1/5 women who are murdered are murdered by strangers, and keep in mind the risk of homicide is lower for women.\n\n>Although the overall risk of homicide for women was substantially lower than that of men (rate ratio [RR] = 0.27)\n\n-\n\n>In contrast to men, who killed nonintimate acquaintances, strangers, or victims of undetermined relationship in 80% of cases, women killed their spouse, an intimate acquaintance, or a family member in 60% of cases.\n\nYour husband/boyfriend is 4 times more likely to kill a stranger than he is to kill you, and you are more likely to kill him vs a stranger.\n\nHow are those stats for you?",

If you are respectful, give her options and space to appropriately determine the reality of the situation and her safety, while always giving her the clear opportunity to leave.... the chances of you getting lucky skyrocket.* \n\nPersonally, if a man clearly asks for my consent and seems genuine in his concern for my safety, I legitimately want to sleep with him.

I merely pointed out that men are also at risk physically, but never said it was an equal risk.  To be honest, even after texting, phone conversations, video chats, and a platonic meet and greet, when I am at the point when I am alone with a woman, I can't say that the thought still never crosses my mind for a very brief moment that she could pull out a weapon and do Lord knows what.  The good news is that I'm an excellent  character judge and the outcomes have always been successful, and mutually so.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you were to look at my post history, you'd see that more often than not I will support an SB I who believe makes a valid point and disagree with an SD who I think is wrong.  \n\nI noticed the other day in your biography you wanted people to review that you are a law student.  You should know then that if you are making an argument, the burden of proof is on you, the accuser.  \n\nBe that as it may, as you demanded, I did \"the work.\" I expanded all the 170+ replies and this is what I found using Ctrl+F on your key words.  I also used single words like \"murdered\"  \"murder\" \"easier\" and \"easy\" to facilitate finding your alleged comments.  One caveat, I cannot account for anyone who deleted their post after your comment.  Here is what I could find, and believe me, I tried.\r  \n1.  \"women have it easier\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n2.  \"most women won't be raped or murdered\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n3.  \"risk is worth the reward\u201d - Words taken out of context.  The commenter said, \"If you don't think \\*the risk is worth the reward\\* to engage in a sugar relationship, you absolutely shouldn't do it.\"  \r  \n\r  \nIf I missed something, prove me wrong.  I stand by my earlier comment that you\u2019ve grossly mischaracterized the attitudes of the vast majority -- repeat vast majority -- of SDs who have expressed in this Forum that they do not wish to pressure any girl into having sex against her will or do them any harm.  Your suggestion that this is a significant pattern in this online Forum is faulty and influenced by your preconceived notions, based on Lord only knows.",

When you say women all over the world feel threatened every single day just living their daily lives you weaken your argument by being almost hyperbolic. \n\nIn answer to your question, I do have a young daughter who is a recent college grad and has worked in two very large cities. As a concerned dad I have discussed this topic with her and she responds, \u201csometimes yes and sometimes no.\u201d\n\nDo some women feel threatened every day?  Sure. What\u2019s your point?\n\nThe problem is the OP\u2019s rant tries to indict the majority of men on this sub as bad actors when there\u2019s no objective reason to say so. All she\u2019s done is taken selected comments and declared them \u201cthe rule.\u201d\n\nYes, there are bad actors in the Bowl and one is too many. Her little disclaimer at the end about not all guys being bad is of no help. \n\nP.S.:  There is a rant like hers weekly (probably more often) and the same from men.",

In 1989\u20131990, while engaging in street prostitution along highways in Florida, she shot dead and robbed seven of her male clients. Wuornos claimed that her clients had either raped or attempted to rape her, and that all of the homicides were committed in self-defense. Wuornos was sentenced to death for six of the murders and on October 9, 2002, after 12 years on Florida's death row, was executed by lethal injection.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

And I don\u2019t understand how you would get the impression that OP thinks SBs are the only ones taking a risk- she literally points out herself that they are taking a risk of being scammed. \n\nHer point is very simple- The fear of losing money is not equal to the fear being raped or killed! And the fear of being exposed for being a sugar daddy is also not equal to the fear of being raped and murdered! You can, in fact, compare the two, and it\u2019s not gaslighting, especially when she specifically says that there are risks for men, they just ARE NOT AS GRAVE AS THE RISKS FOR WOMEN! And as others have mentioned, these risks apply to all women, SB or not. Like you said yourself, the risks SDs assume is for the \u201csuperficial fun\u201d of having a SB. Those risks are optional. If you are married and know you have a lot to lose by sugaring, then you can in fact choose not to do it. But sugaring or not, women will face these risks by doing the most mundane tasks. \n\nAnd hard disagree that men have \u201cmore to lose\u201d because they have been around longer and possibly built more relationships and obtained more stuff. So you\u2019re really gonna argue that if someone has more material things to lose, losing those things by being scammed or exposed is a bigger deal than losing your LIFE? And I don\u2019t even agree with the logic that being around longer and accumulating more means that you somehow have a more meaningful, rich inner life than someone who hasn\u2019t. The life of a wealthy man is not more valuable than the life of someone who has less, because they are wealthy? All people have equal value by virtue of being people! \n\nThis post isn\u2019t controversial because OP doesn\u2019t live in reality- OP is very in tune with reality! It shouldn\u2019t be controversial at all. It is not some hot take to say that it is worse to lose your life than to be scammed. What is not clicking here??? Would you rather be out some money, or fucking dead? JFC",

Men, on this sub, only call women scammers when they ask for money in advance or expect to get paid for a platonic date.\n\nMost men on this sub have no problem with having multiple unpaid platonic dates before intimacy to allow the woman to get comfortable and feel safe.  Many of us even provide $ gifts at the end of those dates, at our own discretion, but we would never agree to compensate for those platonic dates.  No one is calling women a scammer for not having sex, we only call them a scammer for expecting to get paid for platonic dates.",

I know this would be frowned upon here, but in the bowl women are called scammers for these things. I was called a scammer a few weeks ago for changing my mind about the possibility of a date right after the m&g. I was getting orange flags and this made it a red one. He then told me he couldn\u2019t trust me if I was going to change my mind on things like this (despite him also telling me he was planning on inviting himself to my place despite my adamance that wouldn\u2019t happen).

Quite the opposite in fact.

We all warn women about sleeping with a man as a sample or with a monthly allowance where the man pays at the end of the month.

His parents apparently never taught him manners, among other things like treating everyone with respect.\n\nActually, that raises an interesting question, at least in my mind.

I merely pointed out that men are also at risk physically, but never said it was an equal risk.  To be honest, even after texting, phone conversations, video chats, and a platonic meet and greet, when I am at the point when I am alone with a woman, I can't say that the thought still never crosses my mind for a very brief moment that she could pull out a weapon and do Lord knows what.  The good news is that I'm an excellent  character judge and the outcomes have always been successful, and mutually so.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you were to look at my post history, you'd see that more often than not I will support an SB I who believe makes a valid point and disagree with an SD who I think is wrong.  \n\nI noticed the other day in your biography you wanted people to review that you are a law student.  You should know then that if you are making an argument, the burden of proof is on you, the accuser.  \n\nBe that as it may, as you demanded, I did \"the work.\" I expanded all the 170+ replies and this is what I found using Ctrl+F on your key words.  I also used single words like \"murdered\"  \"murder\" \"easier\" and \"easy\" to facilitate finding your alleged comments.  One caveat, I cannot account for anyone who deleted their post after your comment.  Here is what I could find, and believe me, I tried.\r  \n1.  \"women have it easier\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n2.  \"most women won't be raped or murdered\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n3.  \"risk is worth the reward\u201d - Words taken out of context.  The commenter said, \"If you don't think \\*the risk is worth the reward\\* to engage in a sugar relationship, you absolutely shouldn't do it.\"  \r  \n\r  \nIf I missed something, prove me wrong.  I stand by my earlier comment that you\u2019ve grossly mischaracterized the attitudes of the vast majority -- repeat vast majority -- of SDs who have expressed in this Forum that they do not wish to pressure any girl into having sex against her will or do them any harm.  Your suggestion that this is a significant pattern in this online Forum is faulty and influenced by your preconceived notions, based on Lord only knows.",

We all warn women about sleeping with a man as a sample or with a monthly allowance where the man pays at the end of the month.

If I didnt have somewhat of a brain it certainly would have been worse, but luckily enough, not listening to him only cost me my infancy credit through an astronomical phone bill. Since it was the only thing he had access to (I forgot to change the password during his tirade of nasty insults for whatever I didn't agree with), he turned it into a business account and went wild with features. I can chuckle about it now, but I cant imagine what else he couldve done had I just let him have free reign over my life. Year before last I ran into two more guys with the same demeanor, im just glad it was pre-meet they lost their shit.

Also, the younger the man, the more emphasis has been placed on being respectful to women. Men today in their 50s and 60s were raised with their mothers who were born in the 30s and 40s. Those women were commonly raised to be homemakers, submissive and compliant with their husband. That\u2019s the home that these older men grew up in, so when he hears a young woman point things out and talk back to him, he gets upset. It\u2019s for that reason that I feel more anxious to express my views to older men because they were raised in a time when women are supposed to view themselves as somewhat lesser. While hopefully most of those values didn\u2019t stick, they still linger, and older men get upset when they\u2019re contradicted by a young woman. That\u2019s when they get violent and lash out.",

Demographics - factors like education, region, urban vs. rural, ethnic group, religion -  might make a difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>While hopefully most of those values didn\u2019t stick, they still linger, and older men get upset when they\u2019re contradicted by a young woman. That\u2019s when they get violent and lash out.\n\nThe way you write suggests you have experienced this type of behavior from older men often. (No further comment unless you want to add something.)",

That said, there's no question that this guy was an overbearing, ill-mannered boor. His parents apparently never taught him manners, among other things like treating everyone with respect.\n\nActually, that raises an interesting question, at least in my mind. Is behavior like that attributable to older men being domineering, arrogant, manipulative, or is it equally (or more) attributable to a profound lack of basic manners?",

Any stats can be taken out of context. Men have plenty to worry about, and its not only allowances.\n\nIt's not a competition. Some M&G at a starbucks is not super dangerous. I'm sick of the narrative that women are never violent. Why is it that when women cherry pick stats that support them everyone nods along and smiles, but when a guy does the same its \"Are you fucking serious?\"\n\nWell, yeah. I'm serious.

I merely pointed out that men are also at risk physically, but never said it was an equal risk.  To be honest, even after texting, phone conversations, video chats, and a platonic meet and greet, when I am at the point when I am alone with a woman, I can't say that the thought still never crosses my mind for a very brief moment that she could pull out a weapon and do Lord knows what.  The good news is that I'm an excellent  character judge and the outcomes have always been successful, and mutually so.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you were to look at my post history, you'd see that more often than not I will support an SB I who believe makes a valid point and disagree with an SD who I think is wrong.  \n\nI noticed the other day in your biography you wanted people to review that you are a law student.  You should know then that if you are making an argument, the burden of proof is on you, the accuser.  \n\nBe that as it may, as you demanded, I did \"the work.\" I expanded all the 170+ replies and this is what I found using Ctrl+F on your key words.  I also used single words like \"murdered\"  \"murder\" \"easier\" and \"easy\" to facilitate finding your alleged comments.  One caveat, I cannot account for anyone who deleted their post after your comment.  Here is what I could find, and believe me, I tried.\r  \n1.  \"women have it easier\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n2.  \"most women won't be raped or murdered\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n3.  \"risk is worth the reward\u201d - Words taken out of context.  The commenter said, \"If you don't think \\*the risk is worth the reward\\* to engage in a sugar relationship, you absolutely shouldn't do it.\"  \r  \n\r  \nIf I missed something, prove me wrong.  I stand by my earlier comment that you\u2019ve grossly mischaracterized the attitudes of the vast majority -- repeat vast majority -- of SDs who have expressed in this Forum that they do not wish to pressure any girl into having sex against her will or do them any harm.  Your suggestion that this is a significant pattern in this online Forum is faulty and influenced by your preconceived notions, based on Lord only knows.",

We all warn women about sleeping with a man as a sample or with a monthly allowance where the man pays at the end of the month.

For me, when I\u2019m with someone my own age, I\u2019m going to call them out on any bullshit right away. I know we grew up in the same generation and at least were taught similar values. Also, the younger the man, the more emphasis has been placed on being respectful to women. Men today in their 50s and 60s were raised with their mothers who were born in the 30s and 40s. Those women were commonly raised to be homemakers, submissive and compliant with their husband. That\u2019s the home that these older men grew up in, so when he hears a young woman point things out and talk back to him, he gets upset. It\u2019s for that reason that I feel more anxious to express my views to older men because they were raised in a time when women are supposed to view themselves as somewhat lesser. While hopefully most of those values didn\u2019t stick, they still linger, and older men get upset when they\u2019re contradicted by a young woman. That\u2019s when they get violent and lash out.",

His parents apparently never taught him manners, among other things like treating everyone with respect.\n\nActually, that raises an interesting question, at least in my mind.

Men have plenty to worry about, and its not only allowances.\n\nIt's not a competition. Some M&G at a starbucks is not super dangerous. I'm sick of the narrative that women are never violent. Why is it that when women cherry pick stats that support them everyone nods along and smiles, but when a guy does the same its \"Are you fucking serious?\"\n\nWell, yeah. I'm serious.

I merely pointed out that men are also at risk physically, but never said it was an equal risk.  To be honest, even after texting, phone conversations, video chats, and a platonic meet and greet, when I am at the point when I am alone with a woman, I can't say that the thought still never crosses my mind for a very brief moment that she could pull out a weapon and do Lord knows what.  The good news is that I'm an excellent  character judge and the outcomes have always been successful, and mutually so.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you were to look at my post history, you'd see that more often than not I will support an SB I who believe makes a valid point and disagree with an SD who I think is wrong.  \n\nI noticed the other day in your biography you wanted people to review that you are a law student.  You should know then that if you are making an argument, the burden of proof is on you, the accuser.  \n\nBe that as it may, as you demanded, I did \"the work.\" I expanded all the 170+ replies and this is what I found using Ctrl+F on your key words.  I also used single words like \"murdered\"  \"murder\" \"easier\" and \"easy\" to facilitate finding your alleged comments.  One caveat, I cannot account for anyone who deleted their post after your comment.  Here is what I could find, and believe me, I tried.\r  \n1.  \"women have it easier\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n2.  \"most women won't be raped or murdered\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n3.  \"risk is worth the reward\u201d - Words taken out of context.  The commenter said, \"If you don't think \\*the risk is worth the reward\\* to engage in a sugar relationship, you absolutely shouldn't do it.\"  \r  \n\r  \nIf I missed something, prove me wrong.  I stand by my earlier comment that you\u2019ve grossly mischaracterized the attitudes of the vast majority -- repeat vast majority -- of SDs who have expressed in this Forum that they do not wish to pressure any girl into having sex against her will or do them any harm.  Your suggestion that this is a significant pattern in this online Forum is faulty and influenced by your preconceived notions, based on Lord only knows.",

When you say women all over the world feel threatened every single day just living their daily lives you weaken your argument by being almost hyperbolic. \n\nIn answer to your question, I do have a young daughter who is a recent college grad and has worked in two very large cities.

All she\u2019s done is taken selected comments and declared them \u201cthe rule.\u201d\n\nYes, there are bad actors in the Bowl and one is too many.

Men, on this sub, only call women scammers when they ask for money in advance or expect to get paid for a platonic date.\n\nMost men on this sub have no problem with having multiple unpaid platonic dates before intimacy to allow the woman to get comfortable and feel safe.  Many of us even provide $ gifts at the end of those dates, at our own discretion, but we would never agree to compensate for those platonic dates.  No one is calling women a scammer for not having sex, we only call them a scammer for expecting to get paid for platonic dates.",

I merely pointed out that men are also at risk physically, but never said it was an equal risk.  To be honest, even after texting, phone conversations, video chats, and a platonic meet and greet, when I am at the point when I am alone with a woman, I can't say that the thought still never crosses my mind for a very brief moment that she could pull out a weapon and do Lord knows what.  The good news is that I'm an excellent  character judge and the outcomes have always been successful, and mutually so.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you were to look at my post history, you'd see that more often than not I will support an SB I who believe makes a valid point and disagree with an SD who I think is wrong.  \n\nI noticed the other day in your biography you wanted people to review that you are a law student.  You should know then that if you are making an argument, the burden of proof is on you, the accuser.  \n\nBe that as it may, as you demanded, I did \"the work.\" I expanded all the 170+ replies and this is what I found using Ctrl+F on your key words.  I also used single words like \"murdered\"  \"murder\" \"easier\" and \"easy\" to facilitate finding your alleged comments.  One caveat, I cannot account for anyone who deleted their post after your comment.  Here is what I could find, and believe me, I tried.\r  \n1.  \"women have it easier\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n2.  \"most women won't be raped or murdered\" - Nobody said that.\r  \n3.  \"risk is worth the reward\u201d - Words taken out of context.  The commenter said, \"If you don't think \\*the risk is worth the reward\\* to engage in a sugar relationship, you absolutely shouldn't do it.\"  \r  \n\r  \nIf I missed something, prove me wrong.  I stand by my earlier comment that you\u2019ve grossly mischaracterized the attitudes of the vast majority -- repeat vast majority -- of SDs who have expressed in this Forum that they do not wish to pressure any girl into having sex against her will or do them any harm.  Your suggestion that this is a significant pattern in this online Forum is faulty and influenced by your preconceived notions, based on Lord only knows.",

When you say women all over the world feel threatened every single day just living their daily lives you weaken your argument by being almost hyperbolic. \n\nIn answer to your question, I do have a young daughter who is a recent college grad and has worked in two very large cities. As a concerned dad I have discussed this topic with her and she responds, \u201csometimes yes and sometimes no.\u201d\n\nDo some women feel threatened every day?  Sure. What\u2019s your point?\n\nThe problem is the OP\u2019s rant tries to indict the majority of men on this sub as bad actors when there\u2019s no objective reason to say so. All she\u2019s done is taken selected comments and declared them \u201cthe rule.\u201d\n\nYes, there are bad actors in the Bowl and one is too many. Her little disclaimer at the end about not all guys being bad is of no help. \n\nP.S.:  There is a rant like hers weekly (probably more often) and the same from men.",

He then told me he couldn\u2019t trust me if I was going to change my mind on things like this (despite him also telling me he was planning on inviting himself to my place despite my adamance that wouldn\u2019t happen).

We all warn women about sleeping with a man as a sample or with a monthly allowance where the man pays at the end of the month.

I know this would be frowned upon here, but in the bowl women are called scammers for these things. I was called a scammer a few weeks ago for changing my mind about the possibility of a date right after the m&g. I was getting orange flags and this made it a red one. He then told me he couldn\u2019t trust me if I was going to change my mind on things like this (despite him also telling me he was planning on inviting himself to my place despite my adamance that wouldn\u2019t happen). So I think this is coming from that kind of perspective. I get you are coming from yours.",

We all warn women about sleeping with a man as a sample or with a monthly allowance where the man pays at the end of the month.

We all warn women about sleeping with a man as a sample or with a monthly allowance where the man pays at the end of the month.  You're preaching to the choir!!\n\nThat's why I continue to think we are violently agreeing!",
