The potential for intrigue was there, the rift between the 5 Great Nations was huge. Which makes the short unification in the story unrealistic for me. Naruto basically dodged multiple potential complex conflicts and solved it with a pretty cheap Gaara speech. The rift barely mattered at the end, the discussion between the Kage in the summit barely mattered after Tobi arrived. That was always what I don't like about Naruto Part 2, the solutions felt too easy and simple for me. The narrative also seemed to be very biased in general.",

So you can't hold that against Part 2 because Part 1 was very straightforward.\n\nBut the solution to peace was always simple in theory. Cooperation and that was achieved against a common enemy which allowed division to be put aside on favor of unity.\n\nAnd there is a laundry list of occurrences of that happening in the real world. But because of the genre Naruto inhabits the wartime alliance becomes permanent and the world becomes peaceful. When in reality a coalition would fracture almost immediately after the antagonistic force has been removed, something Sasuke picked up on.\n\nThere is a reason Kishimoto says Sasuke always felt more realistic than Naruto. If Naruto wasn't shonen, we'd have some pretty key differences in the series and a lot less happy ending.",

The potential for intrigue was there, the rift between the 5 Great Nations was huge. Which makes the short unification in the story unrealistic for me. Naruto basically dodged multiple potential complex conflicts and solved it with a pretty cheap Gaara speech. The rift barely mattered at the end, the discussion between the Kage in the summit barely mattered after Tobi arrived. That was always what I don't like about Naruto Part 2, the solutions felt too easy and simple for me. The narrative also seemed to be very biased in general.",

So you can't hold that against Part 2 because Part 1 was very straightforward.\n\nBut the solution to peace was always simple in theory. Cooperation and that was achieved against a common enemy which allowed division to be put aside on favor of unity.\n\nAnd there is a laundry list of occurrences of that happening in the real world. But because of the genre Naruto inhabits the wartime alliance becomes permanent and the world becomes peaceful. When in reality a coalition would fracture almost immediately after the antagonistic force has been removed, something Sasuke picked up on.\n\nThere is a reason Kishimoto says Sasuke always felt more realistic than Naruto. If Naruto wasn't shonen, we'd have some pretty key differences in the series and a lot less happy ending.",

Naruto basically dodged multiple potential complex conflicts and solved it with a pretty cheap Gaara speech. The rift barely mattered at the end, the discussion between the Kage in the summit barely mattered after Tobi arrived. That was always what I don't like about Naruto Part 2, the solutions felt too easy and simple for me. The narrative also seemed to be very biased in general.",

            "body": "Considering that they were already members of the 5 Great Nations that used the Akatsuki, that could have been an option.\n\nSome could have the intention to weaken strong nations and then betray Tobi at the end for example. The potential for intrigue was there, the rift between the 5 Great Nations was huge. Which makes the short unification in the story unrealistic for me. Naruto basically dodged multiple potential complex conflicts and solved it with a pretty cheap Gaara speech. The rift barely mattered at the end, the discussion between the Kage in the summit barely mattered after Tobi arrived. That was always what I don't like about Naruto Part 2, the solutions felt too easy and simple for me. The narrative also seemed to be very biased in general.",
