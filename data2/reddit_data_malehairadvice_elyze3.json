If you're going for a more mature look, possibility #2 or your normal style both look good.  Keeping your hair long also allows you to wear it in a simple bun, which is a versatile style (it may make your forehead look large though, it's hard to say without seeing it but easy enough to figure out).\n\nIn general, long but well-maintained hair can give you a lot of options for a mature but unique style, and has the added benefit of needing less frequent trips to the barber.",

The only aspects I like of the e-boy trend are all things that are directly pulled from 90s-00s goth/emo/skater.  I absolutely detest the tattoos and makeup if I\u2019m being honest. I think the hair styles generally look better than emo hair though. \n\nLike it\u2019s predecessors it suffers from a problem IMO which is a lack of decent hairstyles for someone with curly hair like me.",
