            "body": "The two biggest mistakes I\u2019ve made in the bowl:\n\n\u2022When I was fairly new, I went on a M&G with a POT and was almost immediately uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t throw up any obvious red flags, but something about him just gave me an unsettled feeling. I convinced myself to give him a chance because of the lack of actual red flags, ignoring the fact that my gut feeling should be the biggest red flag, and agreed to go hang out in his hotel room with him after dinner. Within a few minutes, he was pushing me for intimacy, and for some reason I gave in. After the fact, I went to the bathroom to clean up, he took the envelope of cash that was sitting on the dresser waiting for me, and he left. My gut was right; he was a POS. I no longer do meet and greet intimacy.\n\n\u2022Becoming too comfortable. My most recent SD vanished without warning, one day before I was due my allowance, more than five months into what was an otherwise perfect SR. We had so many plans and I was really counting on them coming to fruition. At this point, I\u2019m sure he lied to me about being married and got caught, because he had far too much invested in me for it to make sense, otherwise. I still can\u2019t believe I let myself get that comfortable after 10 years of sugaring and never letting it happen, before.\n\nLessons learned, all around.",

I can only hope I'm lucky enough to avoid that kind of situation. \n\nYou can't kick yourself about getting comfortable though. We're human and that's just bound to happen, especially after months. It's easy to get into a routine so I can imagine how jarring it is to just one day never hear from them again",

We were in *constant* contact, and were about to start spending at least one night a week together, once he helped me move into a new apartment. We were *mid-conversation* when he stopped answering and the next day he blocked me. It was devastating, but I\u2019ll move on eventually. I\u2019ve been chatting with someone new for a few days that seems very nice, is intelligent and sweet, and handsome, but we\u2019ll see where it goes. \n\nThe hotel incident was enough to teach me several lessons and nothing similar has happened again in the nearly ten years, since, thankfully. Just make sure to really vet someone before being intimate, and always, *always* listen to that intuition.",

The burden of navigating a lifestyle like this can be shared, which is why I immediately fell in love with this sub. The more visibility these things get the more people can hopefully learn from them and avoid them.\n\nI am sorry from the bottom of my heart. I know the shame of admitting mistakes that, when said out loud, just seem so obvious and dumb.

She wanted a spoiled girlfriend type of relationship and so did I. I fell in love fast lol. And of course ignored every red flag in the book. \n\nWe scheduled our first M&G within a few days of talking. I was so excited. We talked on the phone. Exchanged more pics. Everything was great. Well then she starts asking me for money for new headphones. I stupidly sent her some money(2 Benjamin\u2019s or so). Then she asks for money for a cute dress so she can wear on our date. That\u2019s when the red flags started going off like come on let\u2019s meet first. She starts getting really aggressive like if you like me so much you\u2019ll do this for me, send it to me now. \n\nThat\u2019s when I was like alright prove your identity to me, send me your Instagram or something. She said hold on and 20 minutes later sends me the link. It\u2019s obvious she put it together last minute and had like 1 follower or something and no pics haha. At this point I just said you\u2019re a scammer I\u2019m going to move on and I blocked her. \n\nI vowed to never let myself get played like that again. If a POT starts asking for money before the M&G it\u2019s an automatic next.",

For real, I'm so sorry but I really commend you for your decision to be honest. Even if in hindsight you've changed your mind to thinking it would have been better to say nothing, I think difficult truths are always preferable to living a lie.

Her idea of house training a dog is to have them learn to use a peeing pad. Ugh. There went my standing desk mat and yoga mat... threw them out next morning, took the day off and spent the whole day bleaching the goddamn place. \n\nAlso there was no chemistry and she seemed distant and I wasn\u2019t really interested anyway after the dogshit, so nothing happened between us. I still gave her an above local average PPM the morning after because I didn\u2019t know better and just wanted her and the dog out of my house and thats all I could think of.",

If they hadnt moved I think would have met her and would have been worse.",

Only with one guy though. \n\nOn the first meet, he seemed unwashed um.. down there. We didn't have sex, but kinda messed around a bit.\nHe was very pushy to go to my place and have sex, even after I told him no over 15 times. I don't want SDs to know where I live, it's a big safety thing for me. Plus it was very messy at the time due to me not having the time to clean. \nHe was also very persistent on not wearing condoms because he was fixed. With is something I won't do, even if I'm on BC and he's fixed, still doesn't protect me from nasty diseases. \nHe didn't pay me (he said was gonna pay via venmo once I have him my link) but I didn't get to that because the next reason. \nAnd I opened up abit about my past sugar relationships. Including a couple small details from the post I made, and he made a joke about it towards the end. Saying \"Did you have fun? Well at least you didn't get date raped!\" Like that should be something to be proud of. I felt sick to my stomach and sent him a message that it wasn't going to work out because his insensitivity on very serious matters. I sent him the message before I even got home. I didn't want to send the venmo link thinking that he might come after me saying I scammed him. But now looking back, I wish I had gotten the money. But lesson learned. \n\nI don't know if I'd go back into the bowl after this. Maybe if I come across a very good SD that's patient, respectful, and very understanding of some of the things I do to keep myself safe. I don't particularly need one, I'm stable on terms of money, just would be nice to save more and possibly not feel so bad if I wanna spoil myself from time to time. \nIn all it's a possibility I could come back, but I'd need alot of patience from the SD.",

We both dropped the L word, after seeing each other for many months and decided to move on to a SGF arrangement after a trip. She then decided to leave me with no notice, no warning and drop me off like I don\u2019t matter to her. \n\n2) Catching feeling for the same person after they break your heart. \n\nShe came back few months later. We dated again as SBF/SGF, I fell for her again, and this time even harder and she know she meant the world to me. We both once again dropped the L word, we have one of the most amazing few months together from dinner, party, fun activities etc. and I thought may be something real is going on between us. Well she cut me off again with no warning, just one quick lunch conversation and just left me, blocked me off and I don\u2019t even know how to react.\n\nTo all genuine SD/SBF out there, I guess enjoy the fun, the thrill, the intimacy but always always keep your emotion and feeling in check.",

And she mentioned that she has never been in one. So I picked her up when there were a few inches on the ground and took her sliding across a few country roads. This thing is a beast.  Well, fuck. It was a beast. For my fellow gear heads, the build was based off the famous ProDrive tuned wrx. We have an ok time, she really wanted to drive but I thought better for her not too. It was too much car for her. I bring her back to the city to drop her off. And we get tboned at an intersection by some idiot. Like i literally just started to accelerate when the light turned green. Thankfully we are both okay, I'm sore but ok. But the frame and backdoor are bent to hell and the roll cage is beat up too, broken back windshield, etc. The car is basically done. Ugh. I loved that car. \n\nSecond biggest mistake was giving a person too much credit. I had a SR going with someone who was probably the most attractive person I've ever been with. At the start, she wanted to do monthly. I asked to do ppm till there was trust involved. She agreed and we had the best 4 month's of an SR I've ever had. 2 peas in a pod we were. I decided to surprise her for her next visit with plans to go apartment hunting. The driving was getting bothersome and I mentioned having another surprise for her. \nSo. Ugh, I hate typing this out. It was around the holiday season, so I rolled her allowance to a monthly sum, plus some more for presents AND I included extra on top of that she could wipe out one small student loan that had crazy interest on it and one credit card balance that got away from her. Made the bank transfer in the morning and sent a text off to my accountant because the sum was enough that it had to be declared by the bank (yeah, that's how much it was).\nI get to our usual meet up spot and get the room. Hours go by and she hasn't shown up, I sent a text. Then another after a few more hours. It's night time and at this point, I'm concerned because it's almost a 3 hour drive for her. Calls, texts. Nothing. While waiting I open up Instagram and her profile is gone. Open up Snapchat, she's not on the map. I get that sinking feeling in my stomach. Next morning, after more phone calls and texts. I made another small transfer to her account. It doesn't go through. Why is that. Call a bank manager that I am friends with. He says the account is closed. That's why the last transfer didn't go through. He couldn't tell me anything else. Still concerned, i drove to her appt that night. Cleared out.\nThe last message I ever got from her was telling me good night and she would see me in the morning. And if I wanted to go to our favorite breakfast place. \nI didn't think it was enough to start over but apparently; it was.",

I advanced her next PPM and -Yep! you guessed it.    \n\n- A  LT SB requested an advance for the month which I did. Suddenly she had other obligations, that made scheduling our dates difficult.

We didn't have sex, but kinda messed around a bit.\nHe was very pushy to go to my place and have sex, even after I told him no over 15 times. I don't want SDs to know where I live, it's a big safety thing for me. Plus it was very messy at the time due to me not having the time to clean. \nHe was also very persistent on not wearing condoms because he was fixed. With is something I won't do, even if I'm on BC and he's fixed, still doesn't protect me from nasty diseases. \nHe didn't pay me (he said was gonna pay via venmo once I have him my link) but I didn't get to that because the next reason. \nAnd I opened up abit about my past sugar relationships. Including a couple small details from the post I made, and he made a joke about it towards the end. Saying \"Did you have fun? Well at least you didn't get date raped!\" Like that should be something to be proud of. I felt sick to my stomach and sent him a message that it wasn't going to work out because his insensitivity on very serious matters. I sent him the message before I even got home. I didn't want to send the venmo link thinking that he might come after me saying I scammed him. But now looking back, I wish I had gotten the money. But lesson learned. \n\nI don't know if I'd go back into the bowl after this. Maybe if I come across a very good SD that's patient, respectful, and very understanding of some of the things I do to keep myself safe. I don't particularly need one, I'm stable on terms of money, just would be nice to save more and possibly not feel so bad if I wanna spoil myself from time to time. \nIn all it's a possibility I could come back, but I'd need alot of patience from the SD.",

I think that would definitely help, not only with sugaring but just my day to day life too because I've got other issues besides all the stuff sugaring brought along.

We were in *constant* contact, and were about to start spending at least one night a week together, once he helped me move into a new apartment. We were *mid-conversation* when he stopped answering and the next day he blocked me. It was devastating, but I\u2019ll move on eventually. I\u2019ve been chatting with someone new for a few days that seems very nice, is intelligent and sweet, and handsome, but we\u2019ll see where it goes. \n\nThe hotel incident was enough to teach me several lessons and nothing similar has happened again in the nearly ten years, since, thankfully. Just make sure to really vet someone before being intimate, and always, *always* listen to that intuition.",

We didn't have sex, but kinda messed around a bit.\nHe was very pushy to go to my place and have sex, even after I told him no over 15 times. I don't want SDs to know where I live, it's a big safety thing for me. Plus it was very messy at the time due to me not having the time to clean. \nHe was also very persistent on not wearing condoms because he was fixed. With is something I won't do, even if I'm on BC and he's fixed, still doesn't protect me from nasty diseases. \nHe didn't pay me (he said was gonna pay via venmo once I have him my link) but I didn't get to that because the next reason. \nAnd I opened up abit about my past sugar relationships. Including a couple small details from the post I made, and he made a joke about it towards the end. Saying \"Did you have fun? Well at least you didn't get date raped!\" Like that should be something to be proud of. I felt sick to my stomach and sent him a message that it wasn't going to work out because his insensitivity on very serious matters. I sent him the message before I even got home. I didn't want to send the venmo link thinking that he might come after me saying I scammed him. But now looking back, I wish I had gotten the money. But lesson learned. \n\nI don't know if I'd go back into the bowl after this. Maybe if I come across a very good SD that's patient, respectful, and very understanding of some of the things I do to keep myself safe. I don't particularly need one, I'm stable on terms of money, just would be nice to save more and possibly not feel so bad if I wanna spoil myself from time to time. \nIn all it's a possibility I could come back, but I'd need alot of patience from the SD.",

I think that would definitely help, not only with sugaring but just my day to day life too because I've got other issues besides all the stuff sugaring brought along.

We didn't have sex, but kinda messed around a bit.\nHe was very pushy to go to my place and have sex, even after I told him no over 15 times. I don't want SDs to know where I live, it's a big safety thing for me. Plus it was very messy at the time due to me not having the time to clean. \nHe was also very persistent on not wearing condoms because he was fixed. With is something I won't do, even if I'm on BC and he's fixed, still doesn't protect me from nasty diseases. \nHe didn't pay me (he said was gonna pay via venmo once I have him my link) but I didn't get to that because the next reason. \nAnd I opened up abit about my past sugar relationships. Including a couple small details from the post I made, and he made a joke about it towards the end. Saying \"Did you have fun? Well at least you didn't get date raped!\" Like that should be something to be proud of. I felt sick to my stomach and sent him a message that it wasn't going to work out because his insensitivity on very serious matters. I sent him the message before I even got home. I didn't want to send the venmo link thinking that he might come after me saying I scammed him. But now looking back, I wish I had gotten the money. But lesson learned. \n\nI don't know if I'd go back into the bowl after this. Maybe if I come across a very good SD that's patient, respectful, and very understanding of some of the things I do to keep myself safe. I don't particularly need one, I'm stable on terms of money, just would be nice to save more and possibly not feel so bad if I wanna spoil myself from time to time. \nIn all it's a possibility I could come back, but I'd need alot of patience from the SD.",

Looking back, that probably wasn't the best idea either. But yeah, I still haven't gotten around to getting a therapist. I think that would definitely help, not only with sugaring but just my day to day life too because I've got other issues besides all the stuff sugaring brought along. As sad as it is, I feel like dealing with these encounters are helping me find my worth and know when to walk away from bad situations.",

We didn't have sex, but kinda messed around a bit.\nHe was very pushy to go to my place and have sex, even after I told him no over 15 times. I don't want SDs to know where I live, it's a big safety thing for me. Plus it was very messy at the time due to me not having the time to clean. \nHe was also very persistent on not wearing condoms because he was fixed. With is something I won't do, even if I'm on BC and he's fixed, still doesn't protect me from nasty diseases. \nHe didn't pay me (he said was gonna pay via venmo once I have him my link) but I didn't get to that because the next reason. \nAnd I opened up abit about my past sugar relationships. Including a couple small details from the post I made, and he made a joke about it towards the end. Saying \"Did you have fun? Well at least you didn't get date raped!\" Like that should be something to be proud of. I felt sick to my stomach and sent him a message that it wasn't going to work out because his insensitivity on very serious matters. I sent him the message before I even got home. I didn't want to send the venmo link thinking that he might come after me saying I scammed him. But now looking back, I wish I had gotten the money. But lesson learned. \n\nI don't know if I'd go back into the bowl after this. Maybe if I come across a very good SD that's patient, respectful, and very understanding of some of the things I do to keep myself safe. I don't particularly need one, I'm stable on terms of money, just would be nice to save more and possibly not feel so bad if I wanna spoil myself from time to time. \nIn all it's a possibility I could come back, but I'd need alot of patience from the SD.",

Looking back, that probably wasn't the best idea either. But yeah, I still haven't gotten around to getting a therapist. I think that would definitely help, not only with sugaring but just my day to day life too because I've got other issues besides all the stuff sugaring brought along. As sad as it is, I feel like dealing with these encounters are helping me find my worth and know when to walk away from bad situations.",

As sad as it is, I feel like dealing with these encounters are helping me find my worth and know when to walk away from bad situations.",
