I had a POT and the M&G was great and we were planning to meet again but he told me his honest opinion about why things might not work out and I\u2019m thankful that he\u2019s not wasting neither my time nor his. Just wanted to post this as a little something for those people who decide to bash on someone for being \u2018overweight\u2019/\u2018not attractive enough\u2019/etc when the problem isn\u2019t the other person. Sometimes shit just doesn\u2019t work out but you don\u2019t have to be an ass about it. ",
