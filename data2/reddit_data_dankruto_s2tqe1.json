U say that sasuke could use amaterasu to kill the ten tails but that won\u2019t work remember in the war sasuke used a flame control attack on the ten tail and it just repelled it by removing a chunk of its body off where it was burning. And to become the ten tails jinchuriki don\u2019t you need a gedo statue?

The new gen didn't get asspulls, they barely know one or two jutsus from their parents, having trained during academy times. If anything, the generation in Naruto was the asspulled one, always kids getting chunin/jonin before some even graduate from the academy lmao. \n\nThe Otsutsukis are only a part of the plot, and yes it's the continuation of Naruto, you thought they were just going to ignore it like nothing happened? I don't recall you crying when the Uchihas got thousands of asspulls like copying the results of years of hardwork from Lee within a minute or summoning giant spirit titans or literally bending reality or controlling tailed beasts like it was nothing or etc. \n\nBoruto is barely similar with the demon part, yet its no way similar in every other point. Kyuubi was simply sealed within Naruto so as long as the seal remains he risks nothing. He still had to get more powerful to control the beast then eventually befriend it with talk no jutsu. Boruto can't control Momoshiki, he can't befriend him either, Momoshiki is slowly taking over his body to reincarnate, there's no special seal to keep it in permanently either, he has to take drugs to surpress the byakugan and prevent the taking control of the body.",

U say that sasuke could use amaterasu to kill the ten tails but that won\u2019t work remember in the war sasuke used a flame control attack on the ten tail and it just repelled it by removing a chunk of its body off where it was burning. And to become the ten tails jinchuriki don\u2019t you need a gedo statue? And if sasuke did become one it wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop full power isshiki maybe could probably stop jigen with help from naruto tho",

Obito & Madara became Jinjuriki in literally seconds so It wouldn\u2019t take Sasuke long at all.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need the gedou statue that was originally apart of the shippuden 10 tails. This is a whole new 10 tails. \n\nAll Sasuke needs is the rinnegan & he\u2019s got that so it would work. \n\nSasuke as a 10 tails jinjuriki & Naruto would be enough to stop Jigen but I don\u2019t think it would stop Ishikki. \n\nIshikki is just a monster above monsters.\n\nYou make some good points bro!",

The new gen didn't get asspulls, they barely know one or two jutsus from their parents, having trained during academy times. If anything, the generation in Naruto was the asspulled one, always kids getting chunin/jonin before some even graduate from the academy lmao. \n\nThe Otsutsukis are only a part of the plot, and yes it's the continuation of Naruto, you thought they were just going to ignore it like nothing happened? I don't recall you crying when the Uchihas got thousands of asspulls like copying the results of years of hardwork from Lee within a minute or summoning giant spirit titans or literally bending reality or controlling tailed beasts like it was nothing or etc. \n\nBoruto is barely similar with the demon part, yet its no way similar in every other point. Kyuubi was simply sealed within Naruto so as long as the seal remains he risks nothing. He still had to get more powerful to control the beast then eventually befriend it with talk no jutsu. Boruto can't control Momoshiki, he can't befriend him either, Momoshiki is slowly taking over his body to reincarnate, there's no special seal to keep it in permanently either, he has to take drugs to surpress the byakugan and prevent the taking control of the body.",

Jigen would have left naruto in the other dimension, captured kawaki and this would mean that isshiki would be able to resurrect in a perfect vessel meaning that there would be no limit on his lifespan and he\u2019d be stronger than he is. U say that sasuke could use amaterasu to kill the ten tails but that won\u2019t work remember in the war sasuke used a flame control attack on the ten tail and it just repelled it by removing a chunk of its body off where it was burning. And to become the ten tails jinchuriki don\u2019t you need a gedo statue? And if sasuke did become one it wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop full power isshiki maybe could probably stop jigen with help from naruto tho",

Obito & Madara became Jinjuriki in literally seconds so It wouldn\u2019t take Sasuke long at all.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need the gedou statue that was originally apart of the shippuden 10 tails. This is a whole new 10 tails. \n\nAll Sasuke needs is the rinnegan & he\u2019s got that so it would work. \n\nSasuke as a 10 tails jinjuriki & Naruto would be enough to stop Jigen but I don\u2019t think it would stop Ishikki. \n\nIshikki is just a monster above monsters.\n\nYou make some good points bro!",

The new gen didn't get asspulls, they barely know one or two jutsus from their parents, having trained during academy times. If anything, the generation in Naruto was the asspulled one, always kids getting chunin/jonin before some even graduate from the academy lmao. \n\nThe Otsutsukis are only a part of the plot, and yes it's the continuation of Naruto, you thought they were just going to ignore it like nothing happened? I don't recall you crying when the Uchihas got thousands of asspulls like copying the results of years of hardwork from Lee within a minute or summoning giant spirit titans or literally bending reality or controlling tailed beasts like it was nothing or etc. \n\nBoruto is barely similar with the demon part, yet its no way similar in every other point. Kyuubi was simply sealed within Naruto so as long as the seal remains he risks nothing. He still had to get more powerful to control the beast then eventually befriend it with talk no jutsu. Boruto can't control Momoshiki, he can't befriend him either, Momoshiki is slowly taking over his body to reincarnate, there's no special seal to keep it in permanently either, he has to take drugs to surpress the byakugan and prevent the taking control of the body.",

Jigen would have left naruto in the other dimension, captured kawaki and this would mean that isshiki would be able to resurrect in a perfect vessel meaning that there would be no limit on his lifespan and he\u2019d be stronger than he is. U say that sasuke could use amaterasu to kill the ten tails but that won\u2019t work remember in the war sasuke used a flame control attack on the ten tail and it just repelled it by removing a chunk of its body off where it was burning. And to become the ten tails jinchuriki don\u2019t you need a gedo statue? And if sasuke did become one it wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop full power isshiki maybe could probably stop jigen with help from naruto tho",
