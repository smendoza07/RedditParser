    "body": "I like to think I'm a good SD. I happily spoil my SB with an above-average PPM, plus plenty of gifts.\n\nAbout a month ago, we had sex for the first time. We had been seeing each other for two months before that, and as we're both new to this, we were nervous. But we both had a really good time, or so I was led to believe. \n\nWe've seen each other twice since then and it hasn't gotten physical. The first of these times I assumed we'd be having sex (because she texted me some pretty spicy stuff), but then she put an appointment to get her nails done right after we met for some reason. The second time she told me that she needed to help her friend with some shopping, again dipping out a short time after I took her out to dinner.\n\nI'm honestly kind of miffed about this. As much as I enjoy her company, part of the reason I'm doing this is sex. I'm half inclined to think she's just playing me, but I feel like she deserves a chance because I really do like her a lot. \n\nIs there any way to word this without coming across like a colossal prick?",

Sexual attraction and compatibility is about more than appearance and is always a bit of a crapshoot. You could just as easily have had the opposite experience; go two months before intimacy and then discover you don't really enjoy sex with her.",

Truth is, I didn't mind an occasional platonic or activity only meet, but since she also had a boyfriend at some point, it didn't feel right to pay her for platonic (rinsing me). \n\nSo you have to tell her she's getting paid only is she puts out, unless you agree to a platonic meet. If she doesn't intend to put out, tell her she has to tell you beforehand so you can opt out. Otherwise, if she does the meet and it's platonic, you're not paying her. \n\nShe's playing on your confusion and lack of clarity and experience right now, and you have to stop paying her when she doesn't put out. You're the one paying, lead and clarify the rules, if she's unhappy, to bad for her, you'll find someone else. Act like you don't care if you need to replace her, even if you do a little.",

You could be kind and say \"I just wanted to make sure you're feeling ready\" or you could point back to a prior agreement \"I just wanted to see if anything changed since we agreed on \\_\\_\\_\\_ because I am sensing something may have changed\". depends on the style you are comfortable with. \n\nBut this is not to resolve the situation - it is already clear that is over. It is to get better at proactively communicating, and linking it back to YOUR FEELINGS while also taking hers into consideration. I have learned that when you explain how something makes you feel, it shows the emotional impact something is having on you and that is something people cannot criticize. you have a right to your feelings, as long as you aren't making your feelings more important than hers. And maybe it can fix the situation - sometimes communication can do that. it's hard. good luck",

I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve said the word intimacy to a POT SB and they asked what I meant by that lol. So now I spell it out and make it clear what I\u2019m looking for. \n\nBut I agree with you, there\u2019s a certain way you have to do it. In the OP\u2019s case I think he needs to be as clear as possible of what he\u2019s expecting no matter how harsh/transactional/sex worker-y he comes across.",

That way, we could both be honest about our time commitments and there was no confusion or disappointment. Sometimes he would ask for a \"hotel date\", other times I would express that I wanted a \"hotel date\" or that I had a busy week but wanted to see him and chat over dinner. \n\nI can't speak for everyone, but as an SB, I'm well aware that SDs want intimacy, and I love that part of a relationship. It's just like any relationship--if your girlfriend seemed to suddenly change her mind about sex, would you just dump her, or would you talk to her about it? I'd hope you would have a conversation first!",

Then i say it is, now you insult it. Not really a productive discussion... but whatever i was just trying to help\n\nAlso, why does it make me an asshole if i am being honest about how i feel? Do you not get turned on when you are with a woman? Why is that taboo?",

I know thats really forward but i just cant help it, youre so sexy in the way you talk and look.\"\n\nHER:\nOh wow, that IS forward of you, but refreshing...\n\nME:\n\nFor example, right now id love to bend you over this table....\n\nHER:\n\nOh really? *moves closer* \n------------\nAnd so it goes on. I make it clear that I am interested in them sexually. I also make it clear that I will not consider dating if sex isnt good. At some point of course the topic changes or it gets more intense. Without fail every girl ive been with is always HAPPY that i am direct and dont beat around the bush. \n\nUsually after that when we get somewhere discreet they cant help themselves. \n\nIm pretty sure this is from \"mode one\" by alan roger currie.\n\n\nAlso, i usually dont but the first drinks, as I gauge the girls intensions, if she seems hesitant about her paying her own 6 margaritas, then thats a massive red flag, however if shes super cool I usually surprise them with paying at the second location",
