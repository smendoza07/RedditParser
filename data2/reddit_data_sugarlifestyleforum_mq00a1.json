    "body": "We recently saw a troll post about a supposed 'bag over the head' fetish. Silly as it was it made me think there was an opportunity for a serious discussion about unusual kinks that SLFers (as fine a bunch of perverts as  I've ever encountered and I say that with all affection and respect) may have.\n\nI'm as kinky as the next man so I'll start. Most of my own kink is actually fairly mundane these days. I like spanking for instance and have never struggled to find a partner in that. But one of my kinks would still be regarded by most people as very extreme so its not something that I readily tell people about in my day to day life. I am well aware that most women in particular find this kink quite confronting and well pretty disgusting really. Its only really when I have become very close to someone that I will even raise it to test the waters.\n\nI broached it with SB recently in a session. She was bound and buttplugged at the time, and looking at me with her big trusting eyes probably thinking what is he going to do this time. I treasure that moment, that feeling, the trust I have built with her over time. It is a power thing but more than that its an intimacy thing that I've always found very poignant.\n\nSo that's when I did it. That's when I introduced my most shameful kink.\n\nThat's when I put the Nickelback on. \n\nAnd I cranked it up loud.\n\nHer eyes bulged, she whimpered. She looked to me for a mercy that my black blighted soul would not grant.\n\nShe could safeword out at any time of course, but I knew she wouldn't want to. Unfortunately for SB her safeword is a Nickelback lyric and she knew if she said it I would think she was just singing along and crank that nasty shit up even louder.\n\nSo all she could do was scream.\n\nI've said it. I'm a Nickelbacker. I know its wrong but I cant stop.\n\nAre there other Nickelbackers out there? Or other unusual kinks?",
