It\u2019s like a get out of jail free card with very unclear limitations. Transformation too. You mean you can transform into *anything*? Any fight against a non-sensor would be a breeze then. You just transform into a rock or a stick or a gentle breeze or whatever, wait for them to walk by, and then pop out and kill them",

You don\u2019t need to educate me on the differences between shadow clones and basic clones. I already know. And since the start of part 2, his main strategy in practically every fight has been 1) trick enemy into engaging shadow clone 2) hit them with a rasengan. Sure, he\u2019ll use clones to feel an enemy out at first, but then he always ends up using the strategy I laid out above. There was even a meme on this sub the other day making fun of it. Most characters in the show could use basic clones to accomplish essentially the same thing: ie distract enemy with clones and then use signature jutsu. My point was that, narratively, no one will do that because it would make naruto\u2019s fights more boring despite it making all the other characters  more effective fighters. Literally the only times it wouldn\u2019t work is when used on sensors/dojutsu users",

It\u2019s like a get out of jail free card with very unclear limitations. Transformation too. You mean you can transform into *anything*? Any fight against a non-sensor would be a breeze then. You just transform into a rock or a stick or a gentle breeze or whatever, wait for them to walk by, and then pop out and kill them",

You don\u2019t need to educate me on the differences between shadow clones and basic clones. I already know. And since the start of part 2, his main strategy in practically every fight has been 1) trick enemy into engaging shadow clone 2) hit them with a rasengan. Sure, he\u2019ll use clones to feel an enemy out at first, but then he always ends up using the strategy I laid out above. There was even a meme on this sub the other day making fun of it. Most characters in the show could use basic clones to accomplish essentially the same thing: ie distract enemy with clones and then use signature jutsu. My point was that, narratively, no one will do that because it would make naruto\u2019s fights more boring despite it making all the other characters  more effective fighters. Literally the only times it wouldn\u2019t work is when used on sensors/dojutsu users",

            "body": "Yeah the basic ninjutsu everybody learns (transformation, substitution, basic clones, etc) are like *really* useful, but it makes sense why nobody uses them tho. Clones are naruto\u2019s thing. If everybody was using them, it would make naruto\u2019s fights really boring. Substitution is kind of a cheap move from a story/choreography perspective. It\u2019s like a get out of jail free card with very unclear limitations. Transformation too. You mean you can transform into *anything*? Any fight against a non-sensor would be a breeze then. You just transform into a rock or a stick or a gentle breeze or whatever, wait for them to walk by, and then pop out and kill them",
