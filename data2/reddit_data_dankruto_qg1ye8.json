Boruto was taught the rasengan from a master of it, pretty early and had some of the best teachers, same with all of them. \n\nWho did Naruto have to teach him?

There\u2019s only so much Naruto could have done between the time of the ending of Shippuden and Boruto. Between that time he still has to protect Konoha and any other of the five great villages and take care of his kids. If true peace were to be established Naruto would need to be ultra wealthy to be able to afford the vast amount of materials and food. And Hokage isn\u2019t the highest position he could obtain, it\u2019s being feudal lord. As Hokage his main job is to protect the land of fire and maintain foreign alliances. As a feudal lord he could impact other lands more drastically.",

They get asspulled power spikes to be able to compete with the otsutsukis instead of exploring the topic mentioned in the first paragraph. \n\nConfronted with this, Naruto's generation continues to pamper these kids, instead of forcing them into situations of true loss and gritty battle where they could hone their mental fortitude to be the kind of shinobi that will fight the biggest threats ever seen.\nNope, instead they joke around and have fun and it doesn't matter at all, because when martians more powerful than Madara show up, they all get some asspulled power-up that will take care of that ez pz.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing some new antagonist/kawaki kill off 5 or 6 of these brats so they finally face the reality of what being a shinobi truly means. And that the price to pay for peace is eternal vigilance and unrest. So much wasted potential, so deaf to the tones set by the original series.",

And the first time he used shadow clone jutsu in naruto Og whenever he used kurama's chakra it appeared as orange colour he used his own chakra until he mastered KCM. Naruto has way above average chakra. Kurama's chakra just made it almost impossible for him to run out of chakra. I would say he has more chakra than 4 kages combined (imo)",

Obito \"died\"efore he could grow and then was trained by fucking Madara and because of the most powerful beings ever. \n\nThe new generation doesn't have this problem, they don't have to discover jutsu on their own. They had powerful mentors who taught them. They weren't rushed to battle at 10, they weren't forced into death matches and actually were allowed to grow. Boruto was taught the rasengan from a master of it, pretty early and had some of the best teachers, same with all of them. \n\nWho did Naruto have to teach him? Fucking Iruka, until he got to Kakashi... imagine him being raised by Kakashi instead. \n\nThe strongest shinobi all survived, they pooled their resources and traded knowledge and then taught it all to a new generation.

Naruto has way above average chakra. Kurama's chakra just made it almost impossible for him to run out of chakra. I would say he has more chakra than 4 kages combined (imo)",

Boruto was taught the rasengan from a master of it, pretty early and had some of the best teachers, same with all of them. \n\nWho did Naruto have to teach him?

Between that time he still has to protect Konoha and any other of the five great villages and take care of his kids. If true peace were to be established Naruto would need to be ultra wealthy to be able to afford the vast amount of materials and food. And Hokage isn\u2019t the highest position he could obtain, it\u2019s being feudal lord. As Hokage his main job is to protect the land of fire and maintain foreign alliances. As a feudal lord he could impact other lands more drastically.",

And the first time he used shadow clone jutsu in naruto Og whenever he used kurama's chakra it appeared as orange colour he used his own chakra until he mastered KCM. Naruto has way above average chakra. Kurama's chakra just made it almost impossible for him to run out of chakra. I would say he has more chakra than 4 kages combined (imo)",

Obito \"died\"efore he could grow and then was trained by fucking Madara and because of the most powerful beings ever. \n\nThe new generation doesn't have this problem, they don't have to discover jutsu on their own. They had powerful mentors who taught them. They weren't rushed to battle at 10, they weren't forced into death matches and actually were allowed to grow. Boruto was taught the rasengan from a master of it, pretty early and had some of the best teachers, same with all of them. \n\nWho did Naruto have to teach him?

There\u2019s only so much Naruto could have done between the time of the ending of Shippuden and Boruto. Between that time he still has to protect Konoha and any other of the five great villages and take care of his kids. If true peace were to be established Naruto would need to be ultra wealthy to be able to afford the vast amount of materials and food. And Hokage isn\u2019t the highest position he could obtain, it\u2019s being feudal lord. As Hokage his main job is to protect the land of fire and maintain foreign alliances. As a feudal lord he could impact other lands more drastically.",

Basically it's like he's resetting the power scaling and now Naruto is still near the top tier ninja, but he's not plot breakingly over powered",

Obito \"died\"efore he could grow and then was trained by fucking Madara and because of the most powerful beings ever. \n\nThe new generation doesn't have this problem, they don't have to discover jutsu on their own. They had powerful mentors who taught them. They weren't rushed to battle at 10, they weren't forced into death matches and actually were allowed to grow. Boruto was taught the rasengan from a master of it, pretty early and had some of the best teachers, same with all of them. \n\nWho did Naruto have to teach him? Fucking Iruka, until he got to Kakashi... imagine him being raised by Kakashi instead. \n\nThe strongest shinobi all survived, they pooled their resources and traded knowledge and then taught it all to a new generation.

Naruto is my most fav Shonen MC out there and it will be really difficult for Boruto to even come close to him. His character has improved but I am not a big fan of him. Lets see if I will become a fan of him in the future or not. So far, I like Kawaki way more than Boruto.",

Boruto feels kind in a realistic way and to me Boruto feels like how i think Naruto would have ended up if minato didnt die. Boruto is also smart like Minato but doesnt have ridiculous chakra like big papa Naruto.\n\nSomething i think is nice is Boruto and Naruto genuinely feel different not they arnt mirrors.",

Naruto has way above average chakra. Kurama's chakra just made it almost impossible for him to run out of chakra. I would say he has more chakra than 4 kages combined (imo)",

Between that time he still has to protect Konoha and any other of the five great villages and take care of his kids. If true peace were to be established Naruto would need to be ultra wealthy to be able to afford the vast amount of materials and food. And Hokage isn\u2019t the highest position he could obtain, it\u2019s being feudal lord. As Hokage his main job is to protect the land of fire and maintain foreign alliances. As a feudal lord he could impact other lands more drastically.",
