I'll try to help the best I can. \n\nHere's the reference image I used but we decided to go a bit shorter on the back and sides than the images. http://imgur.com/a/lnYC8\n\nFor the product, it was a suggestion by my Hairdresser. It's called [Fix Man Handy Man Crafting Clay](http://i.imgur.com/FvXwuBX.jpg) I don't know if it \"the best\" or not, but it work great for me. It's really flexible.\n\nI have a very straight hair naturally. I have a massive hair swirl (idk. if it's the right term in english) on the front but the Clay product really help to cover that.\n\nFor the styling, I first dry my hairs completly (required for the Crafting Clay). After, I'm trying to send my side hairs to the back with a small amount of clay (not to much pressure on sides). With the residue left on my hands, I do the same with the top of the head. Then with another small amount of clay I work the front with my hands and a Brush. \n\nHope it can help you guys! :)",
