I plan to do some practice styling once I have a stronger product to hold my hair. With it growing the way it does, I find it very hard to find products that can hold it up. For now, I will stick with what I know :P Again, thank you all for your help. It is MUCH appreciated!",

I wonder if it would look better if the hair at your temples was shaved into a straight line going straight down, instead of protruding as they are currently. I think removing the protrusion (and thereby the 'U-shape' associated with a receding hairline) would make it impossible to tell that your hair is receding.",
