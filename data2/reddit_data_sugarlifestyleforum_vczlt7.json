However, I don't have the 'right' to tell someone how to live their life or if they should get an abortion or not. I believe that is something which can only be decided by the person in the situation.\n\nSo, I've been told that makes me pro-life and pro-choice. I've also been told I can't be both. Its a bit confusing to be honest lol.\n\nA relationship between older men or women and younger men and women, with or without sugar, is the choice between those people only. I'm not in their relationship, so I have absolutely no right to tell them whether they are right or wrong.\n\nI will defend anyone's right to control over their own thoughts, actions and what not, whether I personally agree with that choice or not.\n\nIts just like with the vaccine. People said, you have to get it. Why? Shouldn't that be a decision a person gets to make? What right does anyone have to force someone to do something they are completely against, perhaps even their doctor recommends against, etc. I don't need to know their reasons, but I respect their right to choose what gets put in their body.\n\nSo, she got 2 abortions, but what were her circumstances.

However, I've lived long enough not to expect someone to stick to their own internal beliefs when they have to 'make sure to get the votes' to stay in office. Hence, why I'm a big believer in term limits.\n\nAs for pro-choicers being murderers, well, I guess if you want to take a hard line approach to it, you could call them that. In saying that, I've seen the utter devastation this choice has taken on someone. And it stays with them for their entire life. It is usually not an easy choice for most women to take this course. At the end of the day though, if a person believes in God, then they have to understand, we mere mortals don't get to judge. As such, I don't. That is something they will answer for in the after life. \n\nJust like choices I've made. My sugaring will definitely have to be answered for. So be it. I will, but no one else gets to judge me. \n\nI guess I just have a different outlook on life. Live and let live. Judge not lest ye be judged. Love thy neighbor as thyself (that's a tough one for me considering I'm not a real big fan of people in general, but I'm working on it). \n\nChristians sometimes annoy me, even though I am Christian. The whole gay thing, and something is wrong with them, and God said don't do it. Yes, I get all that, but he also said not to judge and to love others. You don't have to answer for that, so what is it to you? Seriously, relax and take care of your own backyard, quit poking your nose in other people's lol.\n\nYou talk about adoption facilities and single mother support, but have you been around social workers who tell a single mother that is working, paying rent and trying to do the right thing, they have to do more? They can't get food stamps because they make too much (over the poverty line), they aren't getting any child support (because he can just get a cash paying job and nothing to show any income), they can't even get help from the government.\n\nYet we send BILLIONS overseas. And people call me all kinds of names when I say the money should stay here until we get our people taken care of. Homeless children and vets on the street, children being taken from loving single moms because they don't actually have help from the government, just demands that need to be met, and we ship money overseas like nothing. \n\nWe can't begin to get our 'systems' in better order when money that should be flowing to them is sent elsewhere. Mental health facilities, better and cheaper medical care, the list goes on...but, nah, government sends it overseas. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThis is what happens when you get politicians who care more about the latest 'trends' than actually making a difference in the average American citizens life. \n\nExample, let's go all electric cars. Yeah, how are those below the poverty line actually going to be able to afford one? Or those above it, but still living paycheck to paycheck? What about our electric grid, is it going to be able to handle that? \n\nSmh. Things need to change so there is a more common sense approach to these issues, instead of a full steam ahead and damn the consequences approach.",

There's no place in the U.S., except for maybe parts of Nevada, where you can get a license to do sex work.\n\n\"According to our investigation, Boebert was hired by a wealthy male client in Aspen, Colorado, who was a Koch family member.\"\n\nOn SDM?  Isn't it the common wisdom that whales don't need to prowl sugar websites to find SBs? Maybe the wealthy male client had a cute assistant checking SDM every day to find unlicensed, paid escorts for her boss.\n\n\"Boebert\u2019s rich client subsequently introduced her to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) in Aspen.  After meeting with Senator Cruz, Boebert was encouraged by Cruz to run for political office.\"\n\nThis by itself is how politicians advance in this world. Did the wealthy male client tell Cruz that she was an unlicensed, paid escort? The press release doesn't allege that Cruz gave her a quid pro quo, sex for campaign contributions. Willie Brown introduced Kamala Harris to many people and now she's V.P. What point are they trying to make, except for a loose connection between sugaring and political advancement? \n\nI'm commenting only about the sugar aspects and not the other allegations.",

What skin have the American people got in the game with those people?\n\nIt seems foreign policy takes a higher priority than domestic. I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position. I'm just not a fan of big government, or the way they seem to spend the taxpayers money as if there was billions in reserve.",

People said, you have to get it. Why? Shouldn't that be a decision a person gets to make? What right does anyone have to force someone to do something they are completely against, perhaps even their doctor recommends against, etc. I don't need to know their reasons, but I respect their right to choose what gets put in their body.\n\nSo, she got 2 abortions, but what were her circumstances.

                            "body": "I agree it is somewhat hypocritical. However, I've lived long enough not to expect someone to stick to their own internal beliefs when they have to 'make sure to get the votes' to stay in office. Hence, why I'm a big believer in term limits.\n\nAs for pro-choicers being murderers, well, I guess if you want to take a hard line approach to it, you could call them that. In saying that, I've seen the utter devastation this choice has taken on someone. And it stays with them for their entire life. It is usually not an easy choice for most women to take this course. At the end of the day though, if a person believes in God, then they have to understand, we mere mortals don't get to judge. As such, I don't. That is something they will answer for in the after life. \n\nJust like choices I've made. My sugaring will definitely have to be answered for. So be it. I will, but no one else gets to judge me. \n\nI guess I just have a different outlook on life. Live and let live. Judge not lest ye be judged. Love thy neighbor as thyself (that's a tough one for me considering I'm not a real big fan of people in general, but I'm working on it). \n\nChristians sometimes annoy me, even though I am Christian. The whole gay thing, and something is wrong with them, and God said don't do it. Yes, I get all that, but he also said not to judge and to love others. You don't have to answer for that, so what is it to you? Seriously, relax and take care of your own backyard, quit poking your nose in other people's lol.\n\nYou talk about adoption facilities and single mother support, but have you been around social workers who tell a single mother that is working, paying rent and trying to do the right thing, they have to do more? They can't get food stamps because they make too much (over the poverty line), they aren't getting any child support (because he can just get a cash paying job and nothing to show any income), they can't even get help from the government.\n\nYet we send BILLIONS overseas. And people call me all kinds of names when I say the money should stay here until we get our people taken care of. Homeless children and vets on the street, children being taken from loving single moms because they don't actually have help from the government, just demands that need to be met, and we ship money overseas like nothing. \n\nWe can't begin to get our 'systems' in better order when money that should be flowing to them is sent elsewhere. Mental health facilities, better and cheaper medical care, the list goes on...but, nah, government sends it overseas. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThis is what happens when you get politicians who care more about the latest 'trends' than actually making a difference in the average American citizens life. \n\nExample, let's go all electric cars. Yeah, how are those below the poverty line actually going to be able to afford one? Or those above it, but still living paycheck to paycheck? What about our electric grid, is it going to be able to handle that? \n\nSmh. Things need to change so there is a more common sense approach to these issues, instead of a full steam ahead and damn the consequences approach.",

What skin have the American people got in the game with those people?\n\nIt seems foreign policy takes a higher priority than domestic. I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position. I'm just not a fan of big government, or the way they seem to spend the taxpayers money as if there was billions in reserve.",

Hence, why I'm a big believer in term limits.\n\nAs for pro-choicers being murderers, well, I guess if you want to take a hard line approach to it, you could call them that. In saying that, I've seen the utter devastation this choice has taken on someone. And it stays with them for their entire life. It is usually not an easy choice for most women to take this course. At the end of the day though, if a person believes in God, then they have to understand, we mere mortals don't get to judge. As such, I don't. That is something they will answer for in the after life. \n\nJust like choices I've made. My sugaring will definitely have to be answered for. So be it. I will, but no one else gets to judge me. \n\nI guess I just have a different outlook on life. Live and let live. Judge not lest ye be judged. Love thy neighbor as thyself (that's a tough one for me considering I'm not a real big fan of people in general, but I'm working on it). \n\nChristians sometimes annoy me, even though I am Christian. The whole gay thing, and something is wrong with them, and God said don't do it. Yes, I get all that, but he also said not to judge and to love others. You don't have to answer for that, so what is it to you? Seriously, relax and take care of your own backyard, quit poking your nose in other people's lol.\n\nYou talk about adoption facilities and single mother support, but have you been around social workers who tell a single mother that is working, paying rent and trying to do the right thing, they have to do more? They can't get food stamps because they make too much (over the poverty line), they aren't getting any child support (because he can just get a cash paying job and nothing to show any income), they can't even get help from the government.\n\nYet we send BILLIONS overseas. And people call me all kinds of names when I say the money should stay here until we get our people taken care of. Homeless children and vets on the street, children being taken from loving single moms because they don't actually have help from the government, just demands that need to be met, and we ship money overseas like nothing. \n\nWe can't begin to get our 'systems' in better order when money that should be flowing to them is sent elsewhere. Mental health facilities, better and cheaper medical care, the list goes on...but, nah, government sends it overseas. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThis is what happens when you get politicians who care more about the latest 'trends' than actually making a difference in the average American citizens life. \n\nExample, let's go all electric cars. Yeah, how are those below the poverty line actually going to be able to afford one? Or those above it, but still living paycheck to paycheck? What about our electric grid, is it going to be able to handle that? \n\nSmh. Things need to change so there is a more common sense approach to these issues, instead of a full steam ahead and damn the consequences approach.",

What skin have the American people got in the game with those people?\n\nIt seems foreign policy takes a higher priority than domestic. I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position. I'm just not a fan of big government, or the way they seem to spend the taxpayers money as if there was billions in reserve.",

However, I've lived long enough not to expect someone to stick to their own internal beliefs when they have to 'make sure to get the votes' to stay in office. Hence, why I'm a big believer in term limits.\n\nAs for pro-choicers being murderers, well, I guess if you want to take a hard line approach to it, you could call them that. In saying that, I've seen the utter devastation this choice has taken on someone. And it stays with them for their entire life. It is usually not an easy choice for most women to take this course. At the end of the day though, if a person believes in God, then they have to understand, we mere mortals don't get to judge. As such, I don't. That is something they will answer for in the after life. \n\nJust like choices I've made. My sugaring will definitely have to be answered for. So be it. I will, but no one else gets to judge me. \n\nI guess I just have a different outlook on life. Live and let live. Judge not lest ye be judged. Love thy neighbor as thyself (that's a tough one for me considering I'm not a real big fan of people in general, but I'm working on it). \n\nChristians sometimes annoy me, even though I am Christian. The whole gay thing, and something is wrong with them, and God said don't do it. Yes, I get all that, but he also said not to judge and to love others. You don't have to answer for that, so what is it to you? Seriously, relax and take care of your own backyard, quit poking your nose in other people's lol.\n\nYou talk about adoption facilities and single mother support, but have you been around social workers who tell a single mother that is working, paying rent and trying to do the right thing, they have to do more? They can't get food stamps because they make too much (over the poverty line), they aren't getting any child support (because he can just get a cash paying job and nothing to show any income), they can't even get help from the government.\n\nYet we send BILLIONS overseas. And people call me all kinds of names when I say the money should stay here until we get our people taken care of. Homeless children and vets on the street, children being taken from loving single moms because they don't actually have help from the government, just demands that need to be met, and we ship money overseas like nothing. \n\nWe can't begin to get our 'systems' in better order when money that should be flowing to them is sent elsewhere. Mental health facilities, better and cheaper medical care, the list goes on...but, nah, government sends it overseas. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThis is what happens when you get politicians who care more about the latest 'trends' than actually making a difference in the average American citizens life. \n\nExample, let's go all electric cars. Yeah, how are those below the poverty line actually going to be able to afford one? Or those above it, but still living paycheck to paycheck? What about our electric grid, is it going to be able to handle that? \n\nSmh. Things need to change so there is a more common sense approach to these issues, instead of a full steam ahead and damn the consequences approach.",

What skin have the American people got in the game with those people?\n\nIt seems foreign policy takes a higher priority than domestic. I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position. I'm just not a fan of big government, or the way they seem to spend the taxpayers money as if there was billions in reserve.",

I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position.

What skin have the American people got in the game with those people?\n\nIt seems foreign policy takes a higher priority than domestic. I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position. I'm just not a fan of big government, or the way they seem to spend the taxpayers money as if there was billions in reserve.",

I've never brought the subject up again. \n\nSo, I'm not saying everyone lives in fear, but I do know some who, literally, do. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe issue at hand though, is should I allow someone to come along and forcefully vaccinated my mother, who would literally rather die than have the vaccine? I'm sorry, but I can't stand by and let that happen, whether I agree if she should get the vaccine or not.",

What skin have the American people got in the game with those people?\n\nIt seems foreign policy takes a higher priority than domestic. I have an issue with that. \n\nNow, if we had proper support for mental health facilities, more affordable health care, better support for single mothers and a whole host of other things, I might not take issue with sending that money.\n\nAre you a vet? Do you have family that are vets? If you are, or know someone that is, perhaps you have seen first hand what some vets have to deal with. If not, I'd recommend you look into it. Our vets come back from things that are beyond our imagining, have seen or possibly done things which they can't recover from, without proper help. Many of them turn to drugs or alcohol because they can't get the help they need and drowned themselves in these to escape from the reality of the life they lived.\n\nIf vets truly have very fine services for them, then why is it around 37,000 vets are homeless on any given night? I guess we could calculate statistics and the like and find that number to be 'acceptable' in comparison to other vets, but is it acceptable? \n\nThere are 2.5 million homeless children in the US. Is that an acceptable number in comparison to those not homeless? \n\nI get what you're saying, but I also think there should be priorities, and our own should come before the rest of the world. \n\nThe reason I decided against running for office was cost. When you have to raise, in many instances, millions of dollars to even attempt to go for the position of say, a representative of the US Congress, its getting a little ridiculous. Not to mention, with numerous people being in Congress for an excessive amount of time, McConnell, Pelosi and the like, who I have trouble believing even remotely have an idea of what American people need, you'll be faced with an uphill battle, at best. If you've had to essentially sell your soul to big pharma or other interest groups to get the money to run and win, what's the point?\n\nAnd I'm truly not having a go at you in relation to your position. I'm just not a fan of big government, or the way they seem to spend the taxpayers money as if there was billions in reserve.",
