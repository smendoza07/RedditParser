It's truly something.\n\nThe 1st thing she said at her speech is: \"i was rewarded for just having fun while filming...\"\n\nThat's the case in RM too, like you can tell she enjoys filming it, and that can only bring good results and positive energy to the set. She won entertainment best rookie and top excellence back to back, for her performance in RM too since day1. She truly is a hardworking frog.",
