I understand how it's different since this show only has so much to do it only depends on one theme per episode, so the activities during each episode might feel repetitive. Yuri plays her part well. She does feels like comedian faking as idol/singer/actress, lol. Only LKS has the gut to do physical gags towards the ladies and get away with it.",
