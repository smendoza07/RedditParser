The fact that even after spending 3 years with orochimaru his morals hadn't changed and he refused to kill people unless extremely necessary. The fact that his personality was almost the same as part 1 or at least more stable than how it was during his rooftop fight with naruto. The fact that he freed all of orochimaru's prisoners when he had no obligation to do that. The fact that he had an explicit no kill policy not only for himself but for his teammates as well. I liked it alot",

He was just so far ahead of every other villain they had fought up to that point. Jiraiya sensei  even died fighting to him, and he was an incredibly powerful sannin, second to only the kage themselves. No other character made you feel as much dread as Pain. The second he destroyed the Hidden Leaf Village he showed just how incredibly vast his power was. Even in death Pain was above everyone they had fought to that point, as he almost killed Naruto and Killer Bee instantly after being reincarnated. Kaguya was leagues ahead of Pain, but not so far ahead of Naruto and Sasuke that fighting seemed hopeless. The feeling of hopelessness that Pain created on screen when he fought, is something I find far more terrifying than body stealing ninjustu Micheal Jackson.",

Hopefully I'll be able to distract them just long enough for some of the non-combatants in the area to be evacuated to the bunkers hidden in the Hokage mountain.\n\nShit, I could probably come up with a comedy routine for each of the Six Paths. For the Animal Path, it will be Pokemon jokes. For the Asura Path, it will be Metal Gear memes. If the Naraka Path pulls out the King of Hell, you can be sure I'll be making Doom Eternal and Devil May Cry references. For the Preta Path, I might humorously refer to them as Dazai Osamu from Bungou Stray Dogs. If the Human Path tries to rip my soul out I'll start singing one of the opening themes of Fullmetal Alchemist as loudly and horribly as I possibly can.\n\nThey probably won't understand any of my references, but my reactions would be unpredictable enough to throw them off their rhythm. All the time they spend bothering to try and parse out some semblance of meaning from my bullshit in order to formulate a more effective argument against my worldviews once it comes time for Pain to lecture me is time they could have otherwise spent murdering innocent people.\n\nEventually they'll get tired of trying to kill me and just send the main Pain over to deal with my shit.\n\nWatch me get pinned down to the ground with a bunch of rods impaled through my limbs like Naruto but every time Pain starts monologuing I just keep interrupting him to make penetration and bondage jokes related to the current situation I am in at the moment. Hell, I'll probably get my head smashed in, but if it buys a little more time for reinforcements to arrive and help evacuate the wounded from ground zero, so be it. \n\nI'm so goddamn obnoxious that most of the village probably wouldn't mind seeing me wiped off the face of the earth, so I won't have to worry about anyone needlessly sacrificing themselves in a suicide mission to save my worthless ass, only to have their memory insulted when I react by making a vine reference to cope with the trauma of witnessing their death.\n\nEventually Pain calls Konan over to try and talk to me because nothing else is working.\n\nIt goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nNobody:\n\nNot even Danzo:\n\nMe: [https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw](https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw)",

I would even put peak orochimaru wit sage form higher than kakashi theoretically. Something that was little explored was all the forbidden and new jitsu, novel or forbidden, orochimaru invented or discovered. A better writer would have flexed his strengths like in part 1.

                    "body": "> Kaguya \n\nThink of how interesting it would been for Orochimaru subplot--he keeps \"helping\" the good guys, knowing it will lead, eventually to Kaguya being revealed. Knowing damn well Naruto will save everyone. \n\nAnd his entire scheme, we see it play out, and even other characters are suspicious of him--but they leave him alone because he is helping them defeat Pain and others--but then, when Kaguya is revealed, he reveals a new forbidden jutsu where he absorbs Kaguya, forcing her inside of himself like another one of the tailed beasts. He escapes, the Ninja world rebuilds.\n\nThe final arc focuses on what Orochimaru is doing with such power--and how he's using it, not to take over the world, but on taking down individual ninja and stealing their abilities--and yes, this time, he actually kills them. No \"sealing\" or burying, or borrowing their bodies, no nonsense.\n\nPart of his new jutsu requires him to kill and drain life force and chakra in order to survive. This leads to the final 10 or so episodes that could be summed up in a movie later, with better animation budget as a re-release finale a year or so later.\n\nBut in the finale, more ninja die--and it's what forces people to seek the peaceful world Naruto dreams about since day 1. They defeat Orochimaru (or Naruto defeats him, basically) by reaching inside of him, in the same way Sasuke was able to go inside Naruto's mind in early Shippuden and see Kurama. Or maybe, Sasuke teams up with Naruto to show him this technique. Forcing Team 7 to lead the remaining Ninja on a large scale attack against Orochimaru and Kaguya. \n\nThey realize the only way to defeat Orochimaru is to seal up Kaguya. This will lead to a big sacrifice from a lot of Ninja, and we will even lose some Gaaras and big Hokage names. Naruto loses his arm here. They seal up Kaguya deep inside Orochimaru's mind and he cannot access this power anymore. Then, they're able to seal him up. And to be sure, they seal the seal that seals him up further--making sure this isn't a returning villain (it's the end of the series).\n\nAt the end of it, Naruto tells Sasuke he must pay for his crimes against the Ninja world. Sasuke excuse himself by saying he was just another Ninja doing cruel things. Naruto doesn't buy it, proclaims he'll make sure Sasuke pays--it's the only way to redeem him. Sakura, no longer a useless muppet, yells at Sasuke telling him that despite her love for him--she cannot forgive him. And it's because of her love, that she'll ensure he pays his debts for all the fallen lives he caused. Sasuke runs into the forest. Sakura yells super loud that he'll find redemption in prison or by her own hands, tears in her eyes. Naruto looks as a weakened Sasuke runs away; remembering his promise to Itachi, Naruto whispers, \"Sasuke...I'll always love you,\" mirroring Itachi's last words and shipping that hot-hot yaoi relationship some fans can't get enough of (Sorry, Sakura, this is not a war you can win--we gotta sell some merch).\n\nThis is where we end the series. Lives have paid for a better future. Sasuke is no \"magically forgiven\" darling and Naruto is almost ready to become Hokage. Despite being asked to be Hokage already, he must go and find his boyfriend, I mean, best friend before he can feel he has saved his village. To him, his boyfriend, I mean best friend, is his village.\n\nThere could be a theater film finale showing the final battle between Sasuke and Naruto/Sakura, but make it more about how they've grown. In the end, either Sasuke dies, because he still feels his clan was humiliated and destroyed for a village that didn't care about him. Well written, this could a strong film where Sasuke's rage and anger is justified--and Team Seven follows the path of the legendary Sannin, but rather than allow another Orochimaru to survive, Sakura and Naruto agree that they must take him down.\n\nEven though they kill him, they build a minor monument inside Konoha to honor his good deeds. An act that is controversial among Ninja and civilians in Konoha.\n\nSakura ain't got no kids by Sasuke. She has grown up. Naruto is one-armed for life. And the series ends. It ends. It's done. No Boruto kun bullshit.\n\n(Sorry, Sakura ^_^;;)",

She manages to outwit almost every trick Sasuke tries because she realizes that her biggest weakness will be her love for him. And it's in this fight that she realizes Sasuke won't change, and she gives herself the worth she deserves and that life isn't about her--but about the village and all that mushy stuff that she never saw because of Sasuke.\n\nSakura foils so much of Sasuke's tactics so Sasuke leaves because Sakura is able to bluff she has stronger attacks, but in reality, she is drained and out of options. Sasuke is weakened and is not willing to risk it because his bigger goal is to destroy the Leaf village, but he is actually scared that Sakura might be even more powerful than she lets on.\n\nThere's a link between her fight and the training she does with Tsunade where Tsunade forces her to think and not just punch blast everything. The emotional weight of the fight is about Sakura overcoming her own childish love for a guy that isn't interested in redemption.\n\nThis would later resonate again when Sasuke leaves as Orochimaru escapes too. \n\nIn the final arc when they defeat Sasuke, Naruto buries his boyfriend, and Sakura buries a stranger--no longer in love with him, but grateful their paths crossed.  Naruto cries for Sasuke. Sakura cries for the end of a clan. Naruto tells her that of all the Ninja he knows, she is the only one that could stand a chance against him, solely by using her wits. She tells him she knows. Her role at the end, would probably be head of Ambu. Though she's a great medical Ninja, she doesn't want to heal allies when they're broken, she wants to prevent the tragedies from happening in the first place.",

Really was terrifying..\n\nI sometimes think back to how different that fight against Hiruzen coulda went. Even heavily subdued, Hashirama and Tobirama shouldve been close to unbeatable back then, luckily Minato couldnt be summoned, and like what would've happened if Orochimaru legit just fought Hiruzen? Instead of relying on the edo tensei? I think Orochimaru could've won one on one, but then again Hiruzen did have Enma too.",

The fact that even after spending 3 years with orochimaru his morals hadn't changed and he refused to kill people unless extremely necessary. The fact that his personality was almost the same as part 1 or at least more stable than how it was during his rooftop fight with naruto. The fact that he freed all of orochimaru's prisoners when he had no obligation to do that. The fact that he had an explicit no kill policy not only for himself but for his teammates as well.

For the Animal Path, it will be Pokemon jokes. For the Asura Path, it will be Metal Gear memes. If the Naraka Path pulls out the King of Hell, you can be sure I'll be making Doom Eternal and Devil May Cry references. For the Preta Path, I might humorously refer to them as Dazai Osamu from Bungou Stray Dogs. If the Human Path tries to rip my soul out I'll start singing one of the opening themes of Fullmetal Alchemist as loudly and horribly as I possibly can.\n\nThey probably won't understand any of my references, but my reactions would be unpredictable enough to throw them off their rhythm. All the time they spend bothering to try and parse out some semblance of meaning from my bullshit in order to formulate a more effective argument against my worldviews once it comes time for Pain to lecture me is time they could have otherwise spent murdering innocent people.\n\nEventually they'll get tired of trying to kill me and just send the main Pain over to deal with my shit.\n\nWatch me get pinned down to the ground with a bunch of rods impaled through my limbs like Naruto but every time Pain starts monologuing I just keep interrupting him to make penetration and bondage jokes related to the current situation I am in at the moment. Hell, I'll probably get my head smashed in, but if it buys a little more time for reinforcements to arrive and help evacuate the wounded from ground zero, so be it. \n\nI'm so goddamn obnoxious that most of the village probably wouldn't mind seeing me wiped off the face of the earth, so I won't have to worry about anyone needlessly sacrificing themselves in a suicide mission to save my worthless ass, only to have their memory insulted when I react by making a vine reference to cope with the trauma of witnessing their death.\n\nEventually Pain calls Konan over to try and talk to me because nothing else is working.\n\nIt goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nNobody:\n\nNot even Danzo:\n\nMe: [https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw](https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw)",

I would even put peak orochimaru wit sage form higher than kakashi theoretically.

Knowing damn well Naruto will save everyone. \n\nAnd his entire scheme, we see it play out, and even other characters are suspicious of him--but they leave him alone because he is helping them defeat Pain and others--but then, when Kaguya is revealed, he reveals a new forbidden jutsu where he absorbs Kaguya, forcing her inside of himself like another one of the tailed beasts. He escapes, the Ninja world rebuilds.\n\nThe final arc focuses on what Orochimaru is doing with such power--and how he's using it, not to take over the world, but on taking down individual ninja and stealing their abilities--and yes, this time, he actually kills them. No \"sealing\" or burying, or borrowing their bodies, no nonsense.\n\nPart of his new jutsu requires him to kill and drain life force and chakra in order to survive. This leads to the final 10 or so episodes that could be summed up in a movie later, with better animation budget as a re-release finale a year or so later.\n\nBut in the finale, more ninja die--and it's what forces people to seek the peaceful world Naruto dreams about since day 1. They defeat Orochimaru (or Naruto defeats him, basically) by reaching inside of him, in the same way Sasuke was able to go inside Naruto's mind in early Shippuden and see Kurama. Or maybe, Sasuke teams up with Naruto to show him this technique. Forcing Team 7 to lead the remaining Ninja on a large scale attack against Orochimaru and Kaguya. \n\nThey realize the only way to defeat Orochimaru is to seal up Kaguya. This will lead to a big sacrifice from a lot of Ninja, and we will even lose some Gaaras and big Hokage names. Naruto loses his arm here. They seal up Kaguya deep inside Orochimaru's mind and he cannot access this power anymore. Then, they're able to seal him up. And to be sure, they seal the seal that seals him up further--making sure this isn't a returning villain (it's the end of the series).\n\nAt the end of it, Naruto tells Sasuke he must pay for his crimes against the Ninja world. Sasuke excuse himself by saying he was just another Ninja doing cruel things. Naruto doesn't buy it, proclaims he'll make sure Sasuke pays--it's the only way to redeem him. Sakura, no longer a useless muppet, yells at Sasuke telling him that despite her love for him--she cannot forgive him. And it's because of her love, that she'll ensure he pays his debts for all the fallen lives he caused. Sasuke runs into the forest. Sakura yells super loud that he'll find redemption in prison or by her own hands, tears in her eyes. Naruto looks as a weakened Sasuke runs away; remembering his promise to Itachi, Naruto whispers, \"Sasuke...I'll always love you,\" mirroring Itachi's last words and shipping that hot-hot yaoi relationship some fans can't get enough of (Sorry, Sakura, this is not a war you can win--we gotta sell some merch).\n\nThis is where we end the series. Lives have paid for a better future. Sasuke is no \"magically forgiven\" darling and Naruto is almost ready to become Hokage. Despite being asked to be Hokage already, he must go and find his boyfriend, I mean, best friend before he can feel he has saved his village. To him, his boyfriend, I mean best friend, is his village.\n\nThere could be a theater film finale showing the final battle between Sasuke and Naruto/Sakura, but make it more about how they've grown. In the end, either Sasuke dies, because he still feels his clan was humiliated and destroyed for a village that didn't care about him. Well written, this could a strong film where Sasuke's rage and anger is justified--and Team Seven follows the path of the legendary Sannin, but rather than allow another Orochimaru to survive, Sakura and Naruto agree that they must take him down.\n\nEven though they kill him, they build a minor monument inside Konoha to honor his good deeds. An act that is controversial among Ninja and civilians in Konoha.\n\nSakura ain't got no kids by Sasuke. She has grown up. Naruto is one-armed for life. And the series ends. It ends. It's done. No Boruto kun bullshit.\n\n(Sorry, Sakura ^_^;;)",

                            "body": "There's so much potential for stories that were never told in Naruto because it focused too heavily on Naruto...gaining another tail or something.\n\nI have a story in mind where Sakura tests her might and goes to find Sasuke alone, when her training with Tsunade is finished, but Naruto is still training. \n\nLong story short: She manages to *almost* beat Sasuke and bring him back due to her advantage of good Chakra control and good wits. She manages to outwit almost every trick Sasuke tries because she realizes that her biggest weakness will be her love for him. And it's in this fight that she realizes Sasuke won't change, and she gives herself the worth she deserves and that life isn't about her--but about the village and all that mushy stuff that she never saw because of Sasuke.\n\nSakura foils so much of Sasuke's tactics so Sasuke leaves because Sakura is able to bluff she has stronger attacks, but in reality, she is drained and out of options. Sasuke is weakened and is not willing to risk it because his bigger goal is to destroy the Leaf village, but he is actually scared that Sakura might be even more powerful than she lets on.\n\nThere's a link between her fight and the training she does with Tsunade where Tsunade forces her to think and not just punch blast everything. The emotional weight of the fight is about Sakura overcoming her own childish love for a guy that isn't interested in redemption.\n\nThis would later resonate again when Sasuke leaves as Orochimaru escapes too. \n\nIn the final arc when they defeat Sasuke, Naruto buries his boyfriend, and Sakura buries a stranger--no longer in love with him, but grateful their paths crossed.  Naruto cries for Sasuke. Sakura cries for the end of a clan. Naruto tells her that of all the Ninja he knows, she is the only one that could stand a chance against him, solely by using her wits. She tells him she knows. Her role at the end, would probably be head of Ambu. Though she's a great medical Ninja, she doesn't want to heal allies when they're broken, she wants to prevent the tragedies from happening in the first place.",

Kakazu was an international bounty hunter who routinely took on high level assassinations and S rank missions for shits and giggles. I\u2019d say they were all really ridiculously busted.

Hopefully I'll be able to distract them just long enough for some of the non-combatants in the area to be evacuated to the bunkers hidden in the Hokage mountain.\n\nShit, I could probably come up with a comedy routine for each of the Six Paths. For the Animal Path, it will be Pokemon jokes. For the Asura Path, it will be Metal Gear memes. If the Naraka Path pulls out the King of Hell, you can be sure I'll be making Doom Eternal and Devil May Cry references. For the Preta Path, I might humorously refer to them as Dazai Osamu from Bungou Stray Dogs. If the Human Path tries to rip my soul out I'll start singing one of the opening themes of Fullmetal Alchemist as loudly and horribly as I possibly can.\n\nThey probably won't understand any of my references, but my reactions would be unpredictable enough to throw them off their rhythm. All the time they spend bothering to try and parse out some semblance of meaning from my bullshit in order to formulate a more effective argument against my worldviews once it comes time for Pain to lecture me is time they could have otherwise spent murdering innocent people.\n\nEventually they'll get tired of trying to kill me and just send the main Pain over to deal with my shit.\n\nWatch me get pinned down to the ground with a bunch of rods impaled through my limbs like Naruto but every time Pain starts monologuing I just keep interrupting him to make penetration and bondage jokes related to the current situation I am in at the moment. Hell, I'll probably get my head smashed in, but if it buys a little more time for reinforcements to arrive and help evacuate the wounded from ground zero, so be it. \n\nI'm so goddamn obnoxious that most of the village probably wouldn't mind seeing me wiped off the face of the earth, so I won't have to worry about anyone needlessly sacrificing themselves in a suicide mission to save my worthless ass, only to have their memory insulted when I react by making a vine reference to cope with the trauma of witnessing their death.\n\nEventually Pain calls Konan over to try and talk to me because nothing else is working.\n\nIt goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nNobody:\n\nNot even Danzo:\n\nMe: [https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw](https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw)",

I would even put peak orochimaru wit sage form higher than kakashi theoretically. Something that was little explored was all the forbidden and new jitsu, novel or forbidden, orochimaru invented or discovered. A better writer would have flexed his strengths like in part 1.

She manages to outwit almost every trick Sasuke tries because she realizes that her biggest weakness will be her love for him. And it's in this fight that she realizes Sasuke won't change, and she gives herself the worth she deserves and that life isn't about her--but about the village and all that mushy stuff that she never saw because of Sasuke.\n\nSakura foils so much of Sasuke's tactics so Sasuke leaves because Sakura is able to bluff she has stronger attacks, but in reality, she is drained and out of options. Sasuke is weakened and is not willing to risk it because his bigger goal is to destroy the Leaf village, but he is actually scared that Sakura might be even more powerful than she lets on.\n\nThere's a link between her fight and the training she does with Tsunade where Tsunade forces her to think and not just punch blast everything. The emotional weight of the fight is about Sakura overcoming her own childish love for a guy that isn't interested in redemption.\n\nThis would later resonate again when Sasuke leaves as Orochimaru escapes too. \n\nIn the final arc when they defeat Sasuke, Naruto buries his boyfriend, and Sakura buries a stranger--no longer in love with him, but grateful their paths crossed.  Naruto cries for Sasuke. Sakura cries for the end of a clan. Naruto tells her that of all the Ninja he knows, she is the only one that could stand a chance against him, solely by using her wits. She tells him she knows. Her role at the end, would probably be head of Ambu. Though she's a great medical Ninja, she doesn't want to heal allies when they're broken, she wants to prevent the tragedies from happening in the first place.",

For the Animal Path, it will be Pokemon jokes. For the Asura Path, it will be Metal Gear memes. If the Naraka Path pulls out the King of Hell, you can be sure I'll be making Doom Eternal and Devil May Cry references. For the Preta Path, I might humorously refer to them as Dazai Osamu from Bungou Stray Dogs. If the Human Path tries to rip my soul out I'll start singing one of the opening themes of Fullmetal Alchemist as loudly and horribly as I possibly can.\n\nThey probably won't understand any of my references, but my reactions would be unpredictable enough to throw them off their rhythm. All the time they spend bothering to try and parse out some semblance of meaning from my bullshit in order to formulate a more effective argument against my worldviews once it comes time for Pain to lecture me is time they could have otherwise spent murdering innocent people.\n\nEventually they'll get tired of trying to kill me and just send the main Pain over to deal with my shit.\n\nWatch me get pinned down to the ground with a bunch of rods impaled through my limbs like Naruto but every time Pain starts monologuing I just keep interrupting him to make penetration and bondage jokes related to the current situation I am in at the moment. Hell, I'll probably get my head smashed in, but if it buys a little more time for reinforcements to arrive and help evacuate the wounded from ground zero, so be it. \n\nI'm so goddamn obnoxious that most of the village probably wouldn't mind seeing me wiped off the face of the earth, so I won't have to worry about anyone needlessly sacrificing themselves in a suicide mission to save my worthless ass, only to have their memory insulted when I react by making a vine reference to cope with the trauma of witnessing their death.\n\nEventually Pain calls Konan over to try and talk to me because nothing else is working.\n\nIt goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nNobody:\n\nNot even Danzo:\n\nMe: [https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw](https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw)",

His genjitsu is so powerful it can warp reality and he could kill his entire clan which not even the first 2 kage or other clans seemed competent enough to accomplish with the entire history of the uchiha. \n\nHe is much in a league of his own and we never see madara or obito even flex such a level of mastery over the sharingan with all their power and skill. \n\nSo itachi is in a league uniquely of his own and his friend he took the eye of and put in a bird. \n\nOrochimaru though is probably equal to or stronger than Jariayah at his peak and if he didn't body swap he could have learned snake sage which Mitsuki has already shown to be op and somewhat mysterious in how it works relative to say toad sage form. I would even put peak orochimaru wit sage form higher than kakashi theoretically. Something that was little explored was all the forbidden and new jitsu, novel or forbidden, orochimaru invented or discovered. A better writer would have flexed his strengths like in part 1. Instead we get orochimaru the cripple bitch who dies in 2 and orochimaru the dude who does nothing in Boruto",

            "body": "There's so much potential for stories that were never told in Naruto because it focused too heavily on Naruto...gaining another tail or something.\n\nI have a story in mind where Sakura tests her might and goes to find Sasuke alone, when her training with Tsunade is finished, but Naruto is still training. \n\nLong story short: She manages to *almost* beat Sasuke and bring him back due to her advantage of good Chakra control and good wits. She manages to outwit almost every trick Sasuke tries because she realizes that her biggest weakness will be her love for him. And it's in this fight that she realizes Sasuke won't change, and she gives herself the worth she deserves and that life isn't about her--but about the village and all that mushy stuff that she never saw because of Sasuke.\n\nSakura foils so much of Sasuke's tactics so Sasuke leaves because Sakura is able to bluff she has stronger attacks, but in reality, she is drained and out of options. Sasuke is weakened and is not willing to risk it because his bigger goal is to destroy the Leaf village, but he is actually scared that Sakura might be even more powerful than she lets on.\n\nThere's a link between her fight and the training she does with Tsunade where Tsunade forces her to think and not just punch blast everything. The emotional weight of the fight is about Sakura overcoming her own childish love for a guy that isn't interested in redemption.\n\nThis would later resonate again when Sasuke leaves as Orochimaru escapes too. \n\nIn the final arc when they defeat Sasuke, Naruto buries his boyfriend, and Sakura buries a stranger--no longer in love with him, but grateful their paths crossed.  Naruto cries for Sasuke. Sakura cries for the end of a clan. Naruto tells her that of all the Ninja he knows, she is the only one that could stand a chance against him, solely by using her wits. She tells him she knows. Her role at the end, would probably be head of Ambu. Though she's a great medical Ninja, she doesn't want to heal allies when they're broken, she wants to prevent the tragedies from happening in the first place.",

Hopefully I'll be able to distract them just long enough for some of the non-combatants in the area to be evacuated to the bunkers hidden in the Hokage mountain.\n\nShit, I could probably come up with a comedy routine for each of the Six Paths. For the Animal Path, it will be Pokemon jokes. For the Asura Path, it will be Metal Gear memes. If the Naraka Path pulls out the King of Hell, you can be sure I'll be making Doom Eternal and Devil May Cry references. For the Preta Path, I might humorously refer to them as Dazai Osamu from Bungou Stray Dogs. If the Human Path tries to rip my soul out I'll start singing one of the opening themes of Fullmetal Alchemist as loudly and horribly as I possibly can.\n\nThey probably won't understand any of my references, but my reactions would be unpredictable enough to throw them off their rhythm. All the time they spend bothering to try and parse out some semblance of meaning from my bullshit in order to formulate a more effective argument against my worldviews once it comes time for Pain to lecture me is time they could have otherwise spent murdering innocent people.\n\nEventually they'll get tired of trying to kill me and just send the main Pain over to deal with my shit.\n\nWatch me get pinned down to the ground with a bunch of rods impaled through my limbs like Naruto but every time Pain starts monologuing I just keep interrupting him to make penetration and bondage jokes related to the current situation I am in at the moment. Hell, I'll probably get my head smashed in, but if it buys a little more time for reinforcements to arrive and help evacuate the wounded from ground zero, so be it. \n\nI'm so goddamn obnoxious that most of the village probably wouldn't mind seeing me wiped off the face of the earth, so I won't have to worry about anyone needlessly sacrificing themselves in a suicide mission to save my worthless ass, only to have their memory insulted when I react by making a vine reference to cope with the trauma of witnessing their death.\n\nEventually Pain calls Konan over to try and talk to me because nothing else is working.\n\nIt goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nNobody:\n\nNot even Danzo:\n\nMe: [https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw](https://youtu.be/-sMQpWCNTQw)",
