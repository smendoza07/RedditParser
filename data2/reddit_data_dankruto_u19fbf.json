Some legends include\u00a0flight,\u00a0invisibility,\u00a0shapeshifting,\u00a0teleportation, the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (bunshin), the summoning of animals (kuchiyose), and control over the\u00a0five classical elements. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the\u00a0Edo period. Magical powers were rooted in the ninja's own\u00a0misinformation\u00a0efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshunjin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ry\u016b, claimed in his own writings (Okufuji Monogatari) that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.[78]\n\n>Perceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under\u00a0katon-no-jutsu\u00a0(\"fire techniques\").[107]\u00a0By dressing in identicle clothing, a coordinated team of ninjas could instill the perception of a single assailant being in multiple locations.\n\nNaruto's ninjas are based on legendary Shinobi, and thus are capable of using magic, just like them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Ninja - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#:~:text=A%20ninja%20(%E5%BF%8D%E8%80%85%2C%20Japanese%20pronunciation,in%20martial%20arts%2C%20including%20ninjutsu.)",

They don't feel like an endless void to mash action figures together in. Resources are finite and hours and hours of fight animation takes a lot of time, so I do get that sacrifices need to be made.

Parroting this from a youtube video I watched once, but the character designs got noticeably more homogenous in shippuden, less detailed in general. The main characters like Naruto still obviously got lots of love in that respect, but a lot of the others were less colorful, and in my opinion less interesting. If you're struggling to keep ahead of the anime and need to pump out manga quick-fast it's a totally reasonable concession to make.\n\n> It was a forest when they started fighting, and was turned into a wasteland by all the tailed beasts fighting and blowing it up\n\nMy arguments surrounding Naruto will never be based around what 'makes sense', because there will invariably be throngs of fans around to defend and justify each decision at a molecular level. So yeah, it makes sense that they were fighting in a barren wasteland they created. I just don't think it's good.",

Every jutsu was given such unique, cool sound effects over the whole series, and in that last fight they just let your knowledge of them take over rather than announce each one.

It's a very balanced powerup, unlike most of the powerups that people got in the war arc.  Even the Mangekyou was relatively non-BS at first given its rarity, the difficulty of obtaining it, and the cost of using it; then it started to be able to do basically anything the plot required and went downhill from there",

This is what people complain about with the powerups in the war arc: many of them come out of nowhere, with barely any setup or foreshadowing, and are completely unbalanced. This applies even to powerups that previously weren't considered to be bullshit because the balancing aspects were effectively ignored, like Kakashi being able to spam Kamui all of a sudden.\n\nIn the case of the Eight Gates, abilities and limitations of the technique are set out almost from the beginning of the series, as is the enormous difficulty of achieving it, requiring a literally ceaseless devotion to training just so you don't immediately die when it's activated. The more powerful it gets, the more difficult it is to achieve, the less time it can be used for, and the more serious the repercussions after it deactivates, all of which balance out how OP it is.\n\nYou see this with the Mangekyou as well: when it was first properly introduced, it was extremely difficult to obtain, carried with it the certainty of eventual blindness, and in the case of Kakashi was so chakra intensive he couldn't use it more than once or twice without risking death. Susano'o was already kind of pushing it in terms of thematic sensibility, and then the war arc tipped it over with Izanagi i.e. literal reality warping.",

Its about tone.\n\n\nNo matter how bonkers stuff get, the fans always loved creative solving instead of just powering up.\n\nFor example, sasuke vs deidara itachi or danzo were all fights sasuke had to use his inteligence to win. Madara just got stronger or sent 2nd meteor or summoned more clonnes or summoned bigger susanoo. Even in the same fight you have kakashi vs tobi in their dimension and its amazing.\n\nFor the tone, just look at Orochimaru. Even simce the begining he used large snakes, large barriers and even reanimation of 2.previous homage, but the tone was more horror-like and less MCU-like.\n\nWhen Orochimaru appears everyone is scared shitless. When madara appears most heroes are making quips and struggling but no one is terrified after the meteor stuff. They should be scared shitless. Its about direction, color palette and other cinematography/movie making stuff that makes tone.  \n\nIn DBZ the hero just gets angrier/stronger while for example sasuke used his sharingan to make danzo think he had one more izanagi use than he did. That was 400iq movie in a battle that you wouldnt assume such a weak genjutsu would make a difference. How did naruto and sasuke defeat madara? They were reincarnations of 2 jesuses.

Just because it\u2019s big doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not strategic.\n\n- His use of phantoms (I think that\u2019s what they were called) while fighting Naruto and Sasuke was very strategic\n\nIn terms of horror, the response when Madara first arrives on the battlefield is the most scared I\u2019ve seen characters on the show. The entire army fights Madara and they end the fight dropping their weapons and fleeing. Even the five kage would have given up against him if it weren\u2019t for Onoki inspiring them to keep fighting.\n\nAlso, Naruto and Sasuke didn\u2019t defeat Madara, they couldn\u2019t defeat him. He won. Black Zetsu is the one who defeated him by literally stabbing him in the back.\n\nKaguya, yeah they kinda just defeated her by punching her enough, not the most strategic fight",

When you set up a combatant to be that overwhelmingly powerful, you need to have a way for the heroes to defeat him, either through tactics or trickery or some other means that raw strength, which is how things were often resolved before this arc.

Are we going to be calling every single debut of a technique an a$$pull?\n\nI\u2019d also argue a lot of these are set up as well. \n\n\n-[Flashback during Chunin exams where Guy mentions limiters in the body](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0052-012.png)\n\n-Lady Chiyo doesn\u2019t necessarily have buildup, but her connection to Sasori and her wanting to create a technique to breathe life into someone, gives it weight and isn\u2019t just a \u201coh btw I have a random ability to bring someone back to life\u201d\n\n- Susanoo is pet of Japanese mythology and is part of a trio. Amaterasu, Tsukiyomi, and Susanoo. Knowing Itachi has Amaterasu and Tsukiyomi prior is buildup for him having Susanoo. Kishimoto likes using mythology from out of universe to build things up\n\n- Another instance of out of universe buildup. In Japanese mythology Susanoo was in possession of the totsuka blade, which was used to slay the mythology figure *Orochi* \n\n-Although not exactly the same as the moment Itachi putting a jutsu into Sasuke, we know you can give another people chakra through contact. If anything, this moment builds up the ability for the 4th Hokage doing something similar when he appears in Naruto. \n\n- Rinne rebirth. The Rinnegan and Pain take a lot from Buddhism (and some from Christianity). Rinne means Samsara, or the cycle of death and rebirth. Pains 6 paths come from the 6 realms of samsara in Buddhism. \nNagato features some Jesus symbolism. His frail body on a [cross](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0443-024.png). Calls himself God. Complete with a lady angel by his side. So yeah while Rinne rebirth wasn\u2019t exactly built up in universe, it fits his whole shtick\n\n- Yead danzo using Izanagi isn\u2019t built up, but it does serve as buildup for Izanami. Duo gods in Japanese mythology",

We\u2019ve seen unique Mangekyo abilities before kamui (Itachi\u2019s Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi), so even though we haven\u2019t seen kamui specifically before it\u2019s not an asspull because we\u2019re aware that the Mangekyo has these unique visual powers\n\nThe reason susanoo doesn\u2019t fall under that is because while we know the Mangekyo has unique abilities, prior to that they were all vision-based and had nothing to do with spirit armor",

Could it be retconed that he was somehow a descendent of the otsotsuki? Yes, they literally retconned kaguya as the source of chakra lmao. Foreshadowing or hinting at a character is not the same as retconning something as true years after. Things like the beginning of Naruto strongly hints at someone pulling the strings for kurama to rampage the village and be sealed into Naruto, it was obviously retconned to be Obito but the initial plot point was there before.",

To be fair, in those examples a significant amount of strategy was used in order to win. \n\nGamanbunta tells Naruto that in order to defeat Shukaku, one must wake up the jinchuriki. And for that they must use the transformation jutsu. Intelligence wins, not brute force.\n\nFight against Kimimaru? Both opponents constantly test each other. Gaara has better range attacks, Kimimaru has better defense and physical prowess. Sand burial doesn't work initially because the bones can withstand the pressure. The bone drill gets countered by Shukaku shield because Gaara used better minerals for the sand. If one can't crush the bone armor with regular sand, then it is better to imprison the enemy. So the royal sand burial is the perfect technique for that. Kimimaru can't see the opponent while underground, so he covers the wole field with spiky bones. Gaara flies with sand. Um, I don't know if it is fair to let Kimimaru merge with the bones like in the picture, but oh well, a slip like that won't ruin the fight.\n\nSomething similar happened to the Itachi and Sasuke fight. Both test the waters and reveal their trump card until the end. About Susano'o. Well, it is only fair to have it in the show if you also consider kyuubi chakra cloak fair as well. After all, both are energy based armor.\n\nAnd on the last panel... Come on, they have been building up the return of the kyuubi since day 1.\n\nI guess, what I am trying to say is, Naruto is a great anime/manga as long as a strategy more complex than \"if hit, hit harder to win (or use bigger explosions)\" is used. That's what the fandom wants",

Tell me why by the end of the chunin exams naruto bites his thumb and summons gamabunta? There was an element of stealth and outsmarting or misleading your opponents.

And that moment is when Jiraya dies.\n\nFrom that moment forward the bullshit starts piling up, until it culminates in the final war. And that is why people point out the final war as \"bad\". Because it is the easiest and most obvious choice to bring up. \"They throw spells at each other like Harry Potter and this is why it is bad\" is supposed to be accepted. After all, this should be unacceptable in a series about ninja.\n\nHowever, the problems with Naruto are many more smaller details such as poor writing choices and poor execution of themes and narrative points. And the shift happens exactly the moment Jiraya dies.",

However, it ends with Naruto fucking talking him down. The collective facepalm at the time was heard in space.\n\nThe Kage Summit has fucking Sakura in it. There is the \"I will kill Sasuke\" moment which no sane person will write into their story. THANK YOU KISHI! And the flip on her part that she loves Naruto. Which was a lie, but served absolutely no purpose and was BAD! FUCKING! WRITING!\n\nAnyway, this has been argued for ages now. Some people say that Naruto is bad only in the final war arc. Some people say that Shippuden as a whole is bad. Some people say that even the Sasuke chase from the original Naruto is when the series started dropping the ball.\n\nIt is not. It is when Jiraya dies. That is THE MOMENT Naruto peaks in storytelling. After that it is a really slow descend in writing, but a descend nonetheless.\n\nThat doesn't mean that one cannot like any arc after that. The Naruto Pain fight is one of my all time favorites. Sasuke vs Danzo is a really good fight. Everything with Madara is great!\n\nBut the writing was not there. The story was getting worse and worse. And we all know how it ultimately ended.",

I was more captivated by the Pain Arc and most of the War Arc than I ever was in OG Naruto or even early Shippuden. Probably the only time in Shippuden where I was as interested as I was during the War Arc was Sakura/Chiyo vs Sasori, which I still contend is one of the greatest fights of the entire series. And for the record, I think Naruto defeating Nagato by talking to him about his ideology is a perfect ending to that arc. So I can see that we just fundamentally disagree about this series and what we consider good writing and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s all a matter of opinion",

Some legends include\u00a0flight,\u00a0invisibility,\u00a0shapeshifting,\u00a0teleportation, the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (bunshin), the summoning of animals (kuchiyose), and control over the\u00a0five classical elements. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the\u00a0Edo period. Magical powers were rooted in the ninja's own\u00a0misinformation\u00a0efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshunjin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ry\u016b, claimed in his own writings (Okufuji Monogatari) that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.[78]\n\n>Perceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under\u00a0katon-no-jutsu\u00a0(\"fire techniques\").[107]\u00a0By dressing in identicle clothing, a coordinated team of ninjas could instill the perception of a single assailant being in multiple locations.\n\nNaruto's ninjas are based on legendary Shinobi, and thus are capable of using magic, just like them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Ninja - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#:~:text=A%20ninja%20(%E5%BF%8D%E8%80%85%2C%20Japanese%20pronunciation,in%20martial%20arts%2C%20including%20ninjutsu.)",

Parroting this from a youtube video I watched once, but the character designs got noticeably more homogenous in shippuden, less detailed in general. The main characters like Naruto still obviously got lots of love in that respect, but a lot of the others were less colorful, and in my opinion less interesting. If you're struggling to keep ahead of the anime and need to pump out manga quick-fast it's a totally reasonable concession to make.\n\n> It was a forest when they started fighting, and was turned into a wasteland by all the tailed beasts fighting and blowing it up\n\nMy arguments surrounding Naruto will never be based around what 'makes sense', because there will invariably be throngs of fans around to defend and justify each decision at a molecular level. So yeah, it makes sense that they were fighting in a barren wasteland they created. I just don't think it's good.",

Final Valley was the peak fight of the series for me I think, I loved the animation, choreography, stakes, and a little detail I'm not sure many people notice- it's one of the only fights in the series (to my memory) that does not announce the jutsu out loud when it's being summoned. Every jutsu was given such unique, cool sound effects over the whole series, and in that last fight they just let your knowledge of them take over rather than announce each one.

This is what people complain about with the powerups in the war arc: many of them come out of nowhere, with barely any setup or foreshadowing, and are completely unbalanced. This applies even to powerups that previously weren't considered to be bullshit because the balancing aspects were effectively ignored, like Kakashi being able to spam Kamui all of a sudden.\n\nIn the case of the Eight Gates, abilities and limitations of the technique are set out almost from the beginning of the series, as is the enormous difficulty of achieving it, requiring a literally ceaseless devotion to training just so you don't immediately die when it's activated. The more powerful it gets, the more difficult it is to achieve, the less time it can be used for, and the more serious the repercussions after it deactivates, all of which balance out how OP it is.\n\nYou see this with the Mangekyou as well: when it was first properly introduced, it was extremely difficult to obtain, carried with it the certainty of eventual blindness, and in the case of Kakashi was so chakra intensive he couldn't use it more than once or twice without risking death. Susano'o was already kind of pushing it in terms of thematic sensibility, and then the war arc tipped it over with Izanagi i.e. literal reality warping.",

Even the five kage would have given up against him if it weren\u2019t for Onoki inspiring them to keep fighting.\n\nAlso, Naruto and Sasuke didn\u2019t defeat Madara, they couldn\u2019t defeat him.

When you set up a combatant to be that overwhelmingly powerful, you need to have a way for the heroes to defeat him, either through tactics or trickery or some other means that raw strength, which is how things were often resolved before this arc.

Are we going to be calling every single debut of a technique an a$$pull?\n\nI\u2019d also argue a lot of these are set up as well. \n\n\n-[Flashback during Chunin exams where Guy mentions limiters in the body](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0052-012.png)\n\n-Lady Chiyo doesn\u2019t necessarily have buildup, but her connection to Sasori and her wanting to create a technique to breathe life into someone, gives it weight and isn\u2019t just a \u201coh btw I have a random ability to bring someone back to life\u201d\n\n- Susanoo is pet of Japanese mythology and is part of a trio. Amaterasu, Tsukiyomi, and Susanoo. Knowing Itachi has Amaterasu and Tsukiyomi prior is buildup for him having Susanoo. Kishimoto likes using mythology from out of universe to build things up\n\n- Another instance of out of universe buildup. In Japanese mythology Susanoo was in possession of the totsuka blade, which was used to slay the mythology figure *Orochi* \n\n-Although not exactly the same as the moment Itachi putting a jutsu into Sasuke, we know you can give another people chakra through contact. If anything, this moment builds up the ability for the 4th Hokage doing something similar when he appears in Naruto. \n\n- Rinne rebirth. The Rinnegan and Pain take a lot from Buddhism (and some from Christianity). Rinne means Samsara, or the cycle of death and rebirth. Pains 6 paths come from the 6 realms of samsara in Buddhism. \nNagato features some Jesus symbolism. His frail body on a [cross](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0443-024.png). Calls himself God. Complete with a lady angel by his side. So yeah while Rinne rebirth wasn\u2019t exactly built up in universe, it fits his whole shtick\n\n- Yead danzo using Izanagi isn\u2019t built up, but it does serve as buildup for Izanami. Duo gods in Japanese mythology",

Madara was built up fine - he was a god-like warrior, there was resurrection jutsu - he had ways to come back, etc. It was a ladder built-up by years of chapters.\n\nBlack Zetsu was a stretch - tempo problem. We've had Obito reveal then Madara reveal _then_ Zetsu reveal. Those were stretching the SOD. \n\nKaguya broke it like a pair of meteors coming from the heavens.\n\nWas it possible to present it better and succesfully?

Her first mention was literally in chp670 when madara for some reason gave her backstory to Hashirama on the battlefield. Could it be retconed that he was somehow a descendent of the otsotsuki? Yes, they literally retconned kaguya as the source of chakra lmao. Foreshadowing or hinting at a character is not the same as retconning something as true years after. Things like the beginning of Naruto strongly hints at someone pulling the strings for kurama to rampage the village and be sealed into Naruto, it was obviously retconned to be Obito but the initial plot point was there before.",

However, it ends with Naruto fucking talking him down. The collective facepalm at the time was heard in space.\n\nThe Kage Summit has fucking Sakura in it. There is the \"I will kill Sasuke\" moment which no sane person will write into their story. THANK YOU KISHI! And the flip on her part that she loves Naruto. Which was a lie, but served absolutely no purpose and was BAD! FUCKING! WRITING!\n\nAnyway, this has been argued for ages now. Some people say that Naruto is bad only in the final war arc. Some people say that Shippuden as a whole is bad. Some people say that even the Sasuke chase from the original Naruto is when the series started dropping the ball.\n\nIt is not. It is when Jiraya dies. That is THE MOMENT Naruto peaks in storytelling. After that it is a really slow descend in writing, but a descend nonetheless.\n\nThat doesn't mean that one cannot like any arc after that. The Naruto Pain fight is one of my all time favorites. Sasuke vs Danzo is a really good fight. Everything with Madara is great!\n\nBut the writing was not there. The story was getting worse and worse. And we all know how it ultimately ended.",

And for the record, I think Naruto defeating Nagato by talking to him about his ideology is a perfect ending to that arc.

They don't feel like an endless void to mash action figures together in. Resources are finite and hours and hours of fight animation takes a lot of time, so I do get that sacrifices need to be made.

The main characters like Naruto still obviously got lots of love in that respect, but a lot of the others were less colorful, and in my opinion less interesting. If you're struggling to keep ahead of the anime and need to pump out manga quick-fast it's a totally reasonable concession to make.\n\n> It was a forest when they started fighting, and was turned into a wasteland by all the tailed beasts fighting and blowing it up\n\nMy arguments surrounding Naruto will never be based around what 'makes sense', because there will invariably be throngs of fans around to defend and justify each decision at a molecular level. So yeah, it makes sense that they were fighting in a barren wasteland they created. I just don't think it's good.",

Every jutsu was given such unique, cool sound effects over the whole series, and in that last fight they just let your knowledge of them take over rather than announce each one.

This is what people complain about with the powerups in the war arc: many of them come out of nowhere, with barely any setup or foreshadowing, and are completely unbalanced. This applies even to powerups that previously weren't considered to be bullshit because the balancing aspects were effectively ignored, like Kakashi being able to spam Kamui all of a sudden.\n\nIn the case of the Eight Gates, abilities and limitations of the technique are set out almost from the beginning of the series, as is the enormous difficulty of achieving it, requiring a literally ceaseless devotion to training just so you don't immediately die when it's activated. The more powerful it gets, the more difficult it is to achieve, the less time it can be used for, and the more serious the repercussions after it deactivates, all of which balance out how OP it is.\n\nYou see this with the Mangekyou as well: when it was first properly introduced, it was extremely difficult to obtain, carried with it the certainty of eventual blindness, and in the case of Kakashi was so chakra intensive he couldn't use it more than once or twice without risking death. Susano'o was already kind of pushing it in terms of thematic sensibility, and then the war arc tipped it over with Izanagi i.e. literal reality warping.",

Amaterasu, Tsukiyomi, and Susanoo. Knowing Itachi has Amaterasu and Tsukiyomi prior is buildup for him having Susanoo. Kishimoto likes using mythology from out of universe to build things up\n\n- Another instance of out of universe buildup. In Japanese mythology Susanoo was in possession of the totsuka blade, which was used to slay the mythology figure *Orochi* \n\n-Although not exactly the same as the moment Itachi putting a jutsu into Sasuke, we know you can give another people chakra through contact. If anything, this moment builds up the ability for the 4th Hokage doing something similar when he appears in Naruto. \n\n- Rinne rebirth. The Rinnegan and Pain take a lot from Buddhism (and some from Christianity). Rinne means Samsara, or the cycle of death and rebirth. Pains 6 paths come from the 6 realms of samsara in Buddhism. \nNagato features some Jesus symbolism. His frail body on a [cross](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0443-024.png). Calls himself God. Complete with a lady angel by his side. So yeah while Rinne rebirth wasn\u2019t exactly built up in universe, it fits his whole shtick\n\n- Yead danzo using Izanagi isn\u2019t built up, but it does serve as buildup for Izanami. Duo gods in Japanese mythology",

Her first mention was literally in chp670 when madara for some reason gave her backstory to Hashirama on the battlefield. Could it be retconed that he was somehow a descendent of the otsotsuki? Yes, they literally retconned kaguya as the source of chakra lmao. Foreshadowing or hinting at a character is not the same as retconning something as true years after. Things like the beginning of Naruto strongly hints at someone pulling the strings for kurama to rampage the village and be sealed into Naruto, it was obviously retconned to be Obito but the initial plot point was there before.",

However, it ends with Naruto fucking talking him down. The collective facepalm at the time was heard in space.\n\nThe Kage Summit has fucking Sakura in it. There is the \"I will kill Sasuke\" moment which no sane person will write into their story. THANK YOU KISHI! And the flip on her part that she loves Naruto. Which was a lie, but served absolutely no purpose and was BAD! FUCKING! WRITING!\n\nAnyway, this has been argued for ages now. Some people say that Naruto is bad only in the final war arc. Some people say that Shippuden as a whole is bad. Some people say that even the Sasuke chase from the original Naruto is when the series started dropping the ball.\n\nIt is not. It is when Jiraya dies. That is THE MOMENT Naruto peaks in storytelling. After that it is a really slow descend in writing, but a descend nonetheless.\n\nThat doesn't mean that one cannot like any arc after that. The Naruto Pain fight is one of my all time favorites. Sasuke vs Danzo is a really good fight. Everything with Madara is great!\n\nBut the writing was not there. The story was getting worse and worse. And we all know how it ultimately ended.",

I was more captivated by the Pain Arc and most of the War Arc than I ever was in OG Naruto or even early Shippuden. Probably the only time in Shippuden where I was as interested as I was during the War Arc was Sakura/Chiyo vs Sasori, which I still contend is one of the greatest fights of the entire series. And for the record, I think Naruto defeating Nagato by talking to him about his ideology is a perfect ending to that arc. So I can see that we just fundamentally disagree about this series and what we consider good writing and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s all a matter of opinion",

If you're struggling to keep ahead of the anime and need to pump out manga quick-fast it's a totally reasonable concession to make.\n\n> It was a forest when they started fighting, and was turned into a wasteland by all the tailed beasts fighting and blowing it up\n\nMy arguments surrounding Naruto will never be based around what 'makes sense', because there will invariably be throngs of fans around to defend and justify each decision at a molecular level. So yeah, it makes sense that they were fighting in a barren wasteland they created. I just don't think it's good.",

This is what people complain about with the powerups in the war arc: many of them come out of nowhere, with barely any setup or foreshadowing, and are completely unbalanced. This applies even to powerups that previously weren't considered to be bullshit because the balancing aspects were effectively ignored, like Kakashi being able to spam Kamui all of a sudden.\n\nIn the case of the Eight Gates, abilities and limitations of the technique are set out almost from the beginning of the series, as is the enormous difficulty of achieving it, requiring a literally ceaseless devotion to training just so you don't immediately die when it's activated. The more powerful it gets, the more difficult it is to achieve, the less time it can be used for, and the more serious the repercussions after it deactivates, all of which balance out how OP it is.\n\nYou see this with the Mangekyou as well: when it was first properly introduced, it was extremely difficult to obtain, carried with it the certainty of eventual blindness, and in the case of Kakashi was so chakra intensive he couldn't use it more than once or twice without risking death. Susano'o was already kind of pushing it in terms of thematic sensibility, and then the war arc tipped it over with Izanagi i.e. literal reality warping.",

When you set up a combatant to be that overwhelmingly powerful, you need to have a way for the heroes to defeat him, either through tactics or trickery or some other means that raw strength, which is how things were often resolved before this arc. In this case though, he was written to be so completely invincible that the heroes didn't even have anything to do with his eventual demise, which is completely unsatisfying from both a narrative and combat standpoint.",

Madara was built up fine - he was a god-like warrior, there was resurrection jutsu - he had ways to come back, etc. It was a ladder built-up by years of chapters.\n\nBlack Zetsu was a stretch - tempo problem. We've had Obito reveal then Madara reveal _then_ Zetsu reveal. Those were stretching the SOD. \n\nKaguya broke it like a pair of meteors coming from the heavens.\n\nWas it possible to present it better and succesfully?

Her first mention was literally in chp670 when madara for some reason gave her backstory to Hashirama on the battlefield. Could it be retconed that he was somehow a descendent of the otsotsuki? Yes, they literally retconned kaguya as the source of chakra lmao. Foreshadowing or hinting at a character is not the same as retconning something as true years after. Things like the beginning of Naruto strongly hints at someone pulling the strings for kurama to rampage the village and be sealed into Naruto, it was obviously retconned to be Obito but the initial plot point was there before.",

And for the record, I think Naruto defeating Nagato by talking to him about his ideology is a perfect ending to that arc.

Parroting this from a youtube video I watched once, but the character designs got noticeably more homogenous in shippuden, less detailed in general. The main characters like Naruto still obviously got lots of love in that respect, but a lot of the others were less colorful, and in my opinion less interesting. If you're struggling to keep ahead of the anime and need to pump out manga quick-fast it's a totally reasonable concession to make.\n\n> It was a forest when they started fighting, and was turned into a wasteland by all the tailed beasts fighting and blowing it up\n\nMy arguments surrounding Naruto will never be based around what 'makes sense', because there will invariably be throngs of fans around to defend and justify each decision at a molecular level. So yeah, it makes sense that they were fighting in a barren wasteland they created. I just don't think it's good.",

Every jutsu was given such unique, cool sound effects over the whole series, and in that last fight they just let your knowledge of them take over rather than announce each one.

Final Valley was the peak fight of the series for me I think, I loved the animation, choreography, stakes, and a little detail I'm not sure many people notice- it's one of the only fights in the series (to my memory) that does not announce the jutsu out loud when it's being summoned. Every jutsu was given such unique, cool sound effects over the whole series, and in that last fight they just let your knowledge of them take over rather than announce each one. That fight kicks serious ass.",
