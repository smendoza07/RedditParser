    "body": "So upon watching the last episode, I've realized how much I'm whipped for JSM. She does her best every episode and is just this bundle of sunshine. Then this thought has me questioning on how people could hate on her. \n\nWhen I thought about how they joined. The controversy about SJH and KJK was fairly new that the episodes after that kind of left a bad taste for some fans, including me because I still have yet to watch some episodes after that. Although I've watched JSM and YSC first episode, I think I didn't continue after that and kind of stop watching for a year. \n\nMaybe its just me, but I kind of feel like JSM and YSC were made to be a distraction and to shift the hate from the producer who fired the two to them instead. Because the hate could've been prevented by introducing them like the four family guests or JWJ for example. \n\nAnyway I might just be overthinking this but it just make me sad that they have to undergo so much unnecessary hate.",

            "body": "Tbh, I wasn't very fond of her when she joined. I would never go as far as hate her, that's just ridiculous, but she wasn't on the top of my list. I don't even remember why... Maybe i wasn't ready for a change in the cast and wanted things to stay as they are. I'm of those who enjoy each and every episode, just watching each week them is a joy itself. After a while, I started noticing how dependent the cast were on her, and how they actually expect a lot more of that \"craziness\" or \"love frog\" that many were uncomfortable with at the beginning, to help with the content. What won me over, was how genuine she is, and how she doesn't try to be someone she isn't, just as normal as any of us, with a past and experiences (bad and good) shaping her to who she is now. How she is actively reaching out to the other members even outside RM, to build a strong chemistry with them as soon as possible, cause she knows RM depends a lot on that aspect. Now she is top of my list, just because she click with each and every member and add unpredictable dynamics within the group. Hard work does not go unnoticed, for most anyway.",

I remembered that period, it was tumultuous, at first KJK and SJH got fired without warning, then they decided to end it together, then KJK managed to persuade the others to stay and continue doing this. Then they got new members.\n\nSomin fit right in with the cast but Sechan took some time to get used to his role. But both of them were adored by the cast members and that chemistry showed until now. \n\nThe chemistry and camaderie of the members are the reason I keep watching. When this show ends, I\u2019m gonna weep, it may not be the best show ever but the memories attached to this show is priceless.",

Chulmin's first run as PD (346-410) starting with bringing in JSM and YSC and ending with the Family Package is (in my opinion) the best run of Running Man episodes outside of the first 100, and Somin is a huge part of that. They recaptured lightning in a bottle and had great episodes almost every single week for more than a year. I think it's unfair to even call it a silver age of the show, it's a second golden age.",

Chulmin's first run as PD (346-410) starting with bringing in JSM and YSC and ending with the Family Package is (in my opinion) the best run of Running Man episodes outside of the first 100, and Somin is a huge part of that. They recaptured lightning in a bottle and had great episodes almost every single week for more than a year. I think it's unfair to even call it a silver age of the show, it's a second golden age.",
