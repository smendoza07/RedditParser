And hair is an easy way to have some kind of identity. \n\nFor you I wouldn't recommend the generic \"fade sides, longer on top\" because your face is rather long and added height on top + removing thickness from the sides that a basic fade would do would only make your face longer. It doesn't mean you can't have this haircut, I just think it would do less for you than it would others who've posted on this sub. You have a good head shape for pretty much any haircut, so why go for the basic one?",
