    "body": "I took about a year off because I found a \u201creal boyfriend\u201d (hint: it didn\u2019t go well lol). I took a bit after that break up and started seeing another guy. And I got bored so I reactivated SA about 2 weeks ago. Finally gave my Google number to a few men. Unfortunately this week I found out that I have to put my dog down. And it is scheduled for today. ALL of the pot SDs have been SO FUCKING SUPPORTIVE. Texting me positive thoughts and prays, saying they\u2019re here to listen if I need to talk, saying they don\u2019t mind if I take time to NOT reply because I\u2019m dealing with my shit, one pot even sent me $ to cover the fees associated with at home euthanasia!  I cried. That was incredibly sweet. \n\nMeanwhile, this guy I\u2019m \u201cdating\u201d made it very clear yesterday that he was disappointed that I wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with him this weekend and that I want to be at home all weekend. I lost my father several years ago so this weekend is a double whammy. \n\nMost SDs are so much more compassionate and understanding.  These pots owe me nothing, especially money to cover the expenses, and they\u2019ve all been incredibly supportive.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an age thing but god damn, I missed this. I missed chivalry. I missed being treated like this.  Im glad I\u2019m back! \n\nAlso, hug your pets tonight. Hug them extra tight.  \u2764\ufe0f",
