That\u2019s when I really realized how much he cares about the fans. Even in the dark, he tried spending time with them, while all the others entertained us on the center stage.\n\nThe fact that their encore is also 45 minutes overtime (and I think unplanned as they were sending signals to each other on what to do next) goes to show they really appreciated the video package that the Running Man Filipino Fans prepared and the audience reaction they received when they came out on stage for the first time until the end of the concert.",

I'm not sure if this is just me and my friends but there was this certain ambience in the concert where we felt that everyone longs to be with one another.
