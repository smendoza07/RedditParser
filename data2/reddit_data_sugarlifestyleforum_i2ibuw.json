    "body": "An SB was talking here earlier about an SD flying her out to meet.  Here's my 2 cents on that.\n\nThe  reason the Twilight series is so popular is because it represents an  attainment fantasy that all women have as part of their suite of  hypergamous instincts. You'll note that the heroine in these stories is  otherwise unremarkable and doesn't really have to *do* anything for all of the attention she's getting, she simply has to *be*.  She sits on her pedestal while all the boys chase after her and fight over her, and wouldn't it be *just thrilling* to be her?\n\nI'm not making fun of that.  Mother Nature has spent millions of years figuring  out what works for our species, and I defer to her experience.\n\nBut my point is this: If some Prince from Afar says that he's scoured the land looking high and low and now comes to you, *the fairest maiden of them all*   \u2014  he's triggering that fantasy in you.  So be skeptical about it,  because you're likely going to rationalize away a lot of the red and  yellow flags that would otherwise give you pause.",

(-: It is a male trait 'thing-y' to proclaim 'fantasy fiction' at anything that seems unreal or unrelatable to their limited funds world of reality (along the same lines of typical male traits of deflection, gaslighting calling women 'emotional', ect.ect).\n\nThey probably thought $10k a table bottle service in Manhattan was fantasy fiction, too. And, why buy a yacht, when running costs are up to a million a year - what a waste! It is all relative to the individual and their wealth. Many uber wealthy men are travelling more than they are 'at home', so it makes sense to see women in other places or just have them travel with him or to him (if he can - why not? Who cares if he does it for ego or because he really likes her as long as he is nice man and generous)...these reddit fellas cannot relate because it is outside of their reality or circle of friends. And, that is okay, middle class is the middle for a reason, but to act like it does not exist and compare it to tweener movies...pfft\n\nWhy worry so much about how other men spend their money or reasons behind it? hmmm...\n\nAnd, amen to healthy boundaries, due to distance!",

(-: It is a male trait 'thing-y' to proclaim 'fantasy fiction' at anything that seems unreal or unrelatable to their limited funds world of reality (along the same lines of typical male traits of deflection, gaslighting calling women 'emotional', ect.ect).\n\nThey probably thought $10k a table bottle service in Manhattan was fantasy fiction, too. And, why buy a yacht, when running costs are up to a million a year - what a waste! It is all relative to the individual and their wealth. Many uber wealthy men are travelling more than they are 'at home', so it makes sense to see women in other places or just have them travel with him or to him (if he can - why not? Who cares if he does it for ego or because he really likes her as long as he is nice man and generous)...these reddit fellas cannot relate because it is outside of their reality or circle of friends. And, that is okay, middle class is the middle for a reason, but to act like it does not exist and compare it to tweener movies...pfft\n\nWhy worry so much about how other men spend their money or reasons behind it? hmmm...\n\nAnd, amen to healthy boundaries, due to distance!",
