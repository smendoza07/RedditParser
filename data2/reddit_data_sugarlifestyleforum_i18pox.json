    "body": "So I had a meet & greet with a POT at a coffee shop today. I got there early, ordered my drink, and waited for the POT to come while I read. All was well...until an older lady sat down next to me. Let me tell you, she radiated Karen vibes to the sun and back and I desperately hoped she was just setting her stuff down at the table next to me, but alas, she was there to stay. Anyways fast forward a couple minutes, and my POT gets there. He's cute, charming, and looks like he's just hittin forty--in short the most attractive guy I've seen on SA by far. Anyways, we're talking through what got him into this kind of dating and what got me into it, and Karen behind me is CLEARLY eavesdropping but she seemed suss from the second my POT came to the table. So after two minutes of us talking (with lowered voices, no less) she gets up and makes a show of gathering up her things, dropping little mutterings like \"well I WAS having a good time\" and \"disgusting,\" all the while grimacing and glaring at me. THEN, she goes outside and talks to some seemingly random older couple sitting by the window outside (on the other side from me & pot, who are inside). She seems to be telling them what she suspects is going and she's gesticulating wildly, so I glance out the window at her. At this point she points at me accusatorially, and the entire table turns to look at us, which, like, awkward as hell. Anyways she leaves and we wrap up our date pretty quickly but it just left me with this sinking feeling. Why, oh, why are people like this?? What the FUCK Karen! Mind your own beeswax!\n\nEDIT: just got this lovely message from a member of our sub who then blocked me lmao. She really is just proving my point \ud83d\ude02 \nhttp://imgur.com/a/dFv1FuF",

I do not think she should have been rude (and, eavesdropping is rude), to the young girl but maybe, they were talking about money, details of the arrangement or he was married..and, those tables at coffee shops are close and it is usually quiet? The fact is that if you put it out in the open people will judge. It is the nature of the beast.\n\nI went out with obnoxious man 'SD' at a classy bar once. I frequented it often, so I was ashamed to ever go back for a LONG time. He was very good looking guy, too...my age but he was LOUD. He brought me FIVE BENJAMINS (Ben Franklin's) for meeting for a drink (no, I did not ask), then handed it to me in an envelope. When I went to the bathroom, he asked loudly, 'did you count it in the bathroom?'...I was mortified as a group of young people (men AND women--my/ our age) were sitting next to us listening. They were not \"karen's\" but a group of people trying to have a nice night out without hearing about 'an arrangement' being discussed at the next table. I would have been giggling and listening, too.\n\nMy advice: Go somewhere the tables are far enough apart from snooping nosy ears and speak quietly...",

I wouldn't have had such a young, hot, and smart girlfriend through the poorest time of my life it I wasn't at least well above average looking, smart, and in the sack. Since she left, I've taken fitness much more seriously. I'm sporting a visible v-taper at a normal BMI, even though I'm pushing 50. \n\n> Certain men on here love to imagine the fantasy that women in their peer group, or close to it, are envious\n\nWomen in my peer group were blindingly envious, because....\n\n> obvious paid date discrepancy\n\nIt was never about the money for me, and still isn't, not least because it's a place I'll never be competitive. \n\nDuring the glory years with that wonderful girl I'm still close with, and will be for life, we were poor as hell. Although, to be fair, her family was 5 miles away. She had a permanent invite back home and money in her purse to get there. \n\n>  If we do notice, we feel sorry for the young girl with her old, pot bellied or dad bod date. If we sugar, we hope they are getting a hefty allowance to compensate for the obvious though.\n\nI joined this sub to probe about \"salt daddy\" game, and your comment kind of nailed it down for me. Keep in mind, *I'm extremely busy, way too busy to present as anything that I'm not*. **I'm not talking about deception in any way.** I'm adulting through this plague like a goddamned warlord. Do you want to come over to drink Coronas and play Pandemic, or not? \n\nI've read the stories about men \"needing a break\" due to a lack of conditioning during sex. I've read the stories of the porn obsessed young men having ED issues. And I read the wonder, on this very sub, about how sugaring sex is so good. \n\nIt's because we older dudes know how to slow our rolls and let our fingers do the talking. She cums first. Always. Unlike many dudes in my cohort, I can follow that with an enthusiastic and athletic railing. \n\nSorry to bang on, but I got the answer I needed from this sub. Women have admitted to me how safe they feel in my arms. I have a brown belt in judo and am active in BJJ. Women feel safe in my arms because if I have to go hands on someone in an altercation, I'm going to be effective. When it comes good looking older men, we don't age like wine, we age like warlords. \n\nTo sum up: Your comment about an allowance to compensate for the obvious crystallized in my mind that it's not so obvious that anyone would need compensation from me. \n\nThen why use Seeking? To put my profile in front of younger women who are open to older lovers, obviously. I'm guessing the ones who would only be with an older man in a sugar arrangement would skip me without batting an eye. I'm seeking the bored and curious, not the desperate. \n\nIf I do sign back up on Seeking, it will be unapologetically salty, straight up, no PPM, no allowance, just a brief respite with a rock amongst raging waters.\n\n\"Unconcerned, mocking, violent: such Wisdom wants us; For she is a woman, and always loves only a warrior.\" *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*",

It\u2019s not the men who want laws against women going topless, or men protesting outside brothels in Europe. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that much of FOSTA/SESTA comes from the wellspring of female intrasexual competition \u2014 or at least the support for it does.

What I ended up finding there was a bitter community of women who use racist terms to describe the behavior of other women (\"Pickmeisha\", if you're curious), called men who behaved poorly \"scrotes\", and banned me after I posted a comment asking where I fit into the community, if I didn't want to get married, didn't want to have kids, but DID want healthy sexual relationships with multiple men?   \n\n\nWhat you said matches with policing behavior - the subreddit is very aggressive, very strict, and pecks endlessly at behavior it doesn't agree with. I bet they read this comment and ban me for good.   \n\n\nIt's tough, because I surely get jealous, myself - but not to the extent of interrupting someone's day or pushing my agenda on anyone else. I wonder what the rest of my thirties are going to look like, now that I'm just more aware of all of this.",

The fact is that if you put it out in the open people will judge. It is the nature of the beast.\n\nI went out with obnoxious man 'SD' at a classy bar once. I frequented it often, so I was ashamed to ever go back for a LONG time. He was very good looking guy, too...my age but he was LOUD. He brought me FIVE BENJAMINS (Ben Franklin's) for meeting for a drink (no, I did not ask), then handed it to me in an envelope. When I went to the bathroom, he asked loudly, 'did you count it in the bathroom?'...I was mortified as a group of young people (men AND women--my/ our age) were sitting next to us listening. They were not \"karen's\" but a group of people trying to have a nice night out without hearing about 'an arrangement' being discussed at the next table. I would have been giggling and listening, too.\n\nMy advice: Go somewhere the tables are far enough apart from snooping nosy ears and speak quietly...",

I wouldn't have had such a young, hot, and smart girlfriend through the poorest time of my life it I wasn't at least well above average looking, smart, and in the sack. Since she left, I've taken fitness much more seriously. I'm sporting a visible v-taper at a normal BMI, even though I'm pushing 50. \n\n> Certain men on here love to imagine the fantasy that women in their peer group, or close to it, are envious\n\nWomen in my peer group were blindingly envious, because....\n\n> obvious paid date discrepancy\n\nIt was never about the money for me, and still isn't, not least because it's a place I'll never be competitive. \n\nDuring the glory years with that wonderful girl I'm still close with, and will be for life, we were poor as hell. Although, to be fair, her family was 5 miles away. She had a permanent invite back home and money in her purse to get there. \n\n>  If we do notice, we feel sorry for the young girl with her old, pot bellied or dad bod date. If we sugar, we hope they are getting a hefty allowance to compensate for the obvious though.\n\nI joined this sub to probe about \"salt daddy\" game, and your comment kind of nailed it down for me. Keep in mind, *I'm extremely busy, way too busy to present as anything that I'm not*. **I'm not talking about deception in any way.** I'm adulting through this plague like a goddamned warlord. Do you want to come over to drink Coronas and play Pandemic, or not? \n\nI've read the stories about men \"needing a break\" due to a lack of conditioning during sex. I've read the stories of the porn obsessed young men having ED issues. And I read the wonder, on this very sub, about how sugaring sex is so good. \n\nIt's because we older dudes know how to slow our rolls and let our fingers do the talking. She cums first. Always. Unlike many dudes in my cohort, I can follow that with an enthusiastic and athletic railing. \n\nSorry to bang on, but I got the answer I needed from this sub. Women have admitted to me how safe they feel in my arms. I have a brown belt in judo and am active in BJJ. Women feel safe in my arms because if I have to go hands on someone in an altercation, I'm going to be effective. When it comes good looking older men, we don't age like wine, we age like warlords. \n\nTo sum up: Your comment about an allowance to compensate for the obvious crystallized in my mind that it's not so obvious that anyone would need compensation from me. \n\nThen why use Seeking? To put my profile in front of younger women who are open to older lovers, obviously. I'm guessing the ones who would only be with an older man in a sugar arrangement would skip me without batting an eye. I'm seeking the bored and curious, not the desperate. \n\nIf I do sign back up on Seeking, it will be unapologetically salty, straight up, no PPM, no allowance, just a brief respite with a rock amongst raging waters.\n\n\"Unconcerned, mocking, violent: such Wisdom wants us; For she is a woman, and always loves only a warrior.\" *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*",

I bet they read this comment and ban me for good.   \n\n\nIt's tough, because I surely get jealous, myself - but not to the extent of interrupting someone's day or pushing my agenda on anyone else.

I'm young but I'm in the same boat wrt not wanting a traditional family or kids, and I'm already starting to get policing comments about it. When I step back from the hurt for a minute, it's easier to see how ridiculous these people are. Like ummm y'all really know me after like 10 minutes of chatting or eavesdropping, huh? People like this interact with us like symbols instead of real people, and knowing that they're not actually against me as a person (how could they be? They don't know me!) helps me with some perspective. Sending light and love! Always down to chat if you want support!",

Not hard to see how you found such a cute and cool SD, congratulations to you! I just might reach out, thank you <3 And good for you, knowing what you want and don't want.   \n\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that this is a far more human reply than I ever got in that dang subreddit.

            "body": "> No, sorry, dude, unless you are Brad Pitt attractive for an older man\n\nGuilty as charged. I wouldn't have had such a young, hot, and smart girlfriend through the poorest time of my life it I wasn't at least well above average looking, smart, and in the sack. Since she left, I've taken fitness much more seriously. I'm sporting a visible v-taper at a normal BMI, even though I'm pushing 50. \n\n> Certain men on here love to imagine the fantasy that women in their peer group, or close to it, are envious\n\nWomen in my peer group were blindingly envious, because....\n\n> obvious paid date discrepancy\n\nIt was never about the money for me, and still isn't, not least because it's a place I'll never be competitive. \n\nDuring the glory years with that wonderful girl I'm still close with, and will be for life, we were poor as hell. Although, to be fair, her family was 5 miles away. She had a permanent invite back home and money in her purse to get there. \n\n>  If we do notice, we feel sorry for the young girl with her old, pot bellied or dad bod date. If we sugar, we hope they are getting a hefty allowance to compensate for the obvious though.\n\nI joined this sub to probe about \"salt daddy\" game, and your comment kind of nailed it down for me. Keep in mind, *I'm extremely busy, way too busy to present as anything that I'm not*. **I'm not talking about deception in any way.** I'm adulting through this plague like a goddamned warlord. Do you want to come over to drink Coronas and play Pandemic, or not? \n\nI've read the stories about men \"needing a break\" due to a lack of conditioning during sex. I've read the stories of the porn obsessed young men having ED issues. And I read the wonder, on this very sub, about how sugaring sex is so good. \n\nIt's because we older dudes know how to slow our rolls and let our fingers do the talking. She cums first. Always. Unlike many dudes in my cohort, I can follow that with an enthusiastic and athletic railing. \n\nSorry to bang on, but I got the answer I needed from this sub. Women have admitted to me how safe they feel in my arms. I have a brown belt in judo and am active in BJJ. Women feel safe in my arms because if I have to go hands on someone in an altercation, I'm going to be effective. When it comes good looking older men, we don't age like wine, we age like warlords. \n\nTo sum up: Your comment about an allowance to compensate for the obvious crystallized in my mind that it's not so obvious that anyone would need compensation from me. \n\nThen why use Seeking? To put my profile in front of younger women who are open to older lovers, obviously. I'm guessing the ones who would only be with an older man in a sugar arrangement would skip me without batting an eye. I'm seeking the bored and curious, not the desperate. \n\nIf I do sign back up on Seeking, it will be unapologetically salty, straight up, no PPM, no allowance, just a brief respite with a rock amongst raging waters.\n\n\"Unconcerned, mocking, violent: such Wisdom wants us; For she is a woman, and always loves only a warrior.\" *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*",

I think because we each have different \"zones of power\" if that makes sense. Our careers are in separate arenas, some of us value children and family, some of us value travel, some of us value time alone! I would say we see each other as equals, and I think it helps us all feel valued.   \n\n\nHOWEVER, I sure have seen what it's like when a woman feels threatened by another. It's not cute. I'll keep my inner Mother Nature in mind, thanks! Haha.",
