Finasteride has a lot of potential long-term side effects, and while they are very rare, it\u2019s still a possibility. \nBesides oral medication you have the option of using Minoxidil which is an OTC topical treatment, alternatively you can use Rosemary oil the same way as Minoxidil (people say the work the same). Regardless, I\u2019d ask a health professional before starting to use anything. :)",
