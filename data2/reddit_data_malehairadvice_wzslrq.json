    "body": "I'm 21. My hair is quite heavily receding and is very thin on top. My Hair thickness is fine and has a wavy texture.\n\n\n1. I know I need to start treatment. I've booked an appointment with my doctor to get on hair growth products. Is there anything else I should bring up with my doctor or any other products I can get.\n\n\n2. I could use recommendations on what haircuts to get right now to make it look a little better. I've never really put effort into my hair so I've got no idea what to ask for to make it look decent.\n\n\n3. What routine and what products should I use to. How should I style it. I've always just used 2in1 shampoo & conditioner every night or two and how it dries is how it stays. I'm guessing this isn't really ideal for my hair.\n\n\nAny advice would really be appreciated. Thanks",

Shave it off\n\n\n2. Start with Finasteride (1 mg), minoxidil 5% (twice a day) and Nizoral (twice a week) if you want a chance at fighting baldness. Consult a dermatologist before you start this regime. I am not a doctor.\n\n\n3. Again consult a dermatologist for your acne. There are many ways through which acnes can be dealt with.\n\n\n4. Start hitting the gym. You seem pretty skinny so definitely start with a bulk. I'd suggest head over to r/fitness and go through their wiki. It has everything you need to know about getting bigger.\n\n\n5. Since you can't grow a beard. Minoxidil can help with that as well.\n\n\nI wish you best of luck. These steps might certainly help you to improve yourself.\n\nEdit: you're 21 so it's safe to start Finasteride. Secondly you have a nice face shape so I'd highly suggest you to hit the gym.\n\nEdit 2: I am going through a depressive phase as well for different reasons. Getting out of depression isn't easy. Try to make these changes and I can assure you slowly but surely you will improve. You're just 21 so you're quite young. I have faith in you and I hope you get out of this slump.",

Just the fact that there is something constant and sure in your life that you know makes you better both physically, mentally, and as an overall person. It gives you a comfort and confidence to face what life throws at you.\n\nStarting out is tough. The hardest part is developing the habit of going to the gym. After that, the workout routines you do can be easily found online. I recommend starting with Compound Movements and getting the technique down before adding on much weight as its easy to get injured otherwise.\n\nI used to count calories and do \"bulks\" and \"cuts\" but realized if you're not a competitive bodybuilder, you don't have to do that. Eat like a normal healthy person and add more protein if you are gaining more muscle than a normal healthy person.",

I may be weaker or have no idea what I'm doing, but forcing my way through the uncomfortable anxiety has given me more confidence.

You\u2019ll look better with it cut off and you can be on treatment while shaving to get the benefits of any possible regrowth while also looking good as you\u2019re waiting. Then in 6 months to a year or so, allow it to get a bit longer and see if you\u2019ve had a response. If not you can just shave it again.",

It'll change your life.\n\nCheck with a dermatologist about tretinion. It's great for your skin, helps with acne, and starting early means you'll look younger than your age group for longer.\n\nAfter you do the min and fin treatments for  1-2 years you can look into a hair transplant. Fin and min take a while to maximize recovery so wait on the transplant.\n\nI have a convict head shape, haha, no really I had it buzzed in the military and it's scary so going bald wasn't an option for me. You're young so your recovery should be better than us older guys that started in our 30s. Dead follicles don't come back so the younger you start the better.\n\nAlso, hit that gym dude! Look at this year as a year to focus solely on yourself. Take pics now, put your head down, grind, and then look back up spring time of 2023. You're going to be shocked.  Start the gym slow and easy. Push yourself a little every time but most importantly just show up to the gym. If you walk through those doors you can always leave whenever but I promise you'll do at least SOMETHING when you get there.",

I can't say much because I don't know your wardrobe but I think dressing up a little will help ease you into a new look :) You got this dude! Also Heads and Shoulders is more trouble than its worth imo, definitely consult with a doc about it and if skin care is an issue I would recommend starting a new routine - My routine is 1) Cetaphil face wash in the shower 2) applying witch hazel toner with a cotton pad outside of the shower 3) with a slightly damp face applying the Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 4) using QV lotion as a final moisturiser on top! This routine works for me but may not work for everybody but hopefully it can help you get an idea!",

It's better to do what you can to improve your situation, and if working out at home is what you can do then that's absolutely a great idea.\n\nJust live day by day and take care of yourself man. I've had some pretty dark periods in my life and showing myself some kindness and understanding has helped me make it through those times.",

It's not easily controllable most of the time, and then there are the times where you're basically dripping with sweat because you made a loud noise in a public space and a bunch of people looked over at you and there's not a single goddamn thought you could think that would make you feel any better, you just need to get the fuck out of there and hide. It's just so far away from what most folks experience that they can't grasp it, and they assume that it's like the anxiety they deal with.\n\nI'm glad that therapy has helped me work through some of mine (a lot of my anxiety is related to childhood physical abuse and neglect), but it took several years of sessions before I got to that point.

Use that, but agreed, going later is always a safe bet. And get noise canceling headphones, those helped a lot with my anxiety in the gym. Also this might not be the safest or most relevant advice but as someone who is nearsighted and wears glasses I found that if I took my glasses off once I got to the machine or equipment I was using, it would help me forget about everyone around me because I literally blurred them out.  Also if you\u2019re really too anxious to go to the gym I would recommend doing some at home yoga on YouTube, it\u2019ll help you with your posture and body awareness and strength which will all help get your confidence up. On YouTube \u201cyoga with adriene\u201d has a couple of 30 day series, I think the one I started with was called \u201chome\u201d and I did it over the course of like a month and a half. Def recommend checking that out. I had friends commenting on my that my posture was visibly better after doing those videos for a few months.",

If you can't do that at least wash your face and put some kind of lotion on it and hopefully over time the acne will go away. Look up bha aha tretinoin moisture barrier.\n\nOnce you get the acne solved maybe you think you'd look better with a beard but can't grow one? Get on minoxidil. Someone who balds that early should theoretically have a super beard. Good luck with the depression though. That's the root cause of your problems. Unfortunately knowing the problem doesn't mean there's an obvious solution. \n\nOn the positive side at least you aren't ugly, so everything is fixable and you are only 21 so you'll hopefully be around another 80 years and even if it took you 10 more years to figure it out, that's a total of another 70 good years plus the good years before depression.",

            "body": "What u/PattyPreston said \n\nThat said I can help out with the skincare part more in depth\n\nYou wanna wash your face twice a day. You\u2019ll need 3 products. A 2% salicylic acid wash for morning to control oil production and then an oil and water based wash for night. The oil wash will be needed to help remove your SPF which is frankly nonnegotiable. You wanna rub that on dry for a bit then rinse it off with water for a few minutes then you move on to the regular wash \n\nGoing back to sunscreen. You wanna apply a 1/4 teaspoon on the face alone or about the length of your index and middle fingers \n\nA little more on the pricey side but I wanna get you to at least actually wear sunscreen so go with La Roche Posay Anthelios. Don\u2019t forget the neck and ears, any exposed skin tbh \n\nYou need to reapply every 2 hours if you\u2019re outside for a considerable amount of time or just were physically active or wet as it will rub off. If you\u2019re pretty sedentary and inside though you can get away with only 1 extra application tho\n\nCircling back to night, once you\u2019re face is clean leave it a little damp and apply a benzoyl peroxide wash. I use PanOxyl, leave it for a few minutes then rinse off. This kills off bacteria to prevent you getting acne also can be used on skin to skin areas on your body to minimize BO\n\nNow moisturize and going to our final step. Squeeze a pea size amount of retinol and apply evenly on your face. This is the ace of your skincare tbh, anti acne, anti aging and tone evenness. I\u2019ll start with CeraVe\u2019s product as it\u2019s very easy on the skin for beginners. Use it slowly. Start with just 1 day the first week and then 2 a day apart the next etc until you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not going to irritate you\n\nFollow all this and I guarantee you\u2019ll see results even in 3 weeks",

Stress affects our physical bodies too so it's important to better that aspect of yourself. \nDefinitely go to the doctor for Finasteride and minoxidil.  I have seen people on subreddits with hair like yours (or sometimes worse) who ended up saving their hair or salvaging a lot of it. They are not an enormous amount of people, but there are others out there who improved their situation. \nDepression is tough. It's hard to realize that things matter and other things need to get done. It's difficult to realize that you're not a victim and depression won't always have the upper hand. But it is possible. And so many people focus on the struggle, because it's easier. But they should focus on the fact that there is a solution. \nGood luck brother",

I started with just pushups, sit-ups and goblet squats at home. later I found a gym that includes personal training with the membership, and that helps hold me accountable having people there for me. Met some cool people too. Plus I don\u2019t know a damn thing about working out or lifting weights. After a month I was comfortable ending my therapy sessions. I looked up what foods contribute to my acne prone skin and cut them out or cut back on them(mainly milk and dairy). It\u2019s honestly helped a lot for my appearance and mindset. I also buzzed my hair to a number 2 on top and am now on fin/min. If you\u2019re interested look into r/tressless.

For your shampoo and conditioner buy Shea Moisture \u201cstrengthen and restore\u201d made with Jamaican black castor oil. The ingredients list is all natural and safe to use everyday. It is important that you condition also. \n\nFor your acne, the first step is to be careful on what foods you consume. You\u2019ll have to search up specifically what to avoid, but dairy milk and oily greasy foods are bad for your skin. Next make sure you drink a lot of water everyday even if ur not thirsty just drink water non stop. You\u2019ll be peeing 10 times a day but you will see a difference in your skin I guarantee it. \n\nFor your skin care routine, get the cerave salisylic acid cleanser and dermalogica daily microfoliant for an exfoliation. And use cerave daily moisturizer with spf if you\u2019re going outside. \n\nFinally, try to workout. I get social anxiety just like you so I\u2019ve been working out at home I bought dumbbells and I have a treadmill. But usually in the summer I\u2019ll be outside playing basketball anything to make it fun for you. \n\nYou\u2019ll get there eventually, anyone can go through a transformation but not everyone can put the work in to do so, so good luck we are rooting for you bud!",

Losing your hair might challenge how you feel about yourself but working on your overall health & fitness could very well provide you with the next best thing, a gateway into creating a new & more satisfying you. \n\nI experienced this myself around 10 years ago when I did the 5:2 diet & lost 2 & a half stone over 6 months. I didn\u2019t treat the 5:2 diet as a diet but rather as a lifestyle change & that was how I was able to keep the weight off.\n\nLosing weight improved my face shape, definition & with the right diet & plenty of daily hydration helped to improve my complexion. Skin is the last part of the body to get hydrated, the internal organs & other body systems come first. Making similar changes could help rebuild your self confidence. \n\nChanging your facial appearance to something more sculpted is a brilliant way to compensate for not having hair & has the potential to enable you to avoid the potential pitfalls & frustrations that accommodate reclaiming a full head of hair. \n\nNo lifestyle change & body improvement will ever cure depression &/or any other mental health conditions. It\u2019ll help but it isn\u2019t a treatment. Whether you have situational depression or clinical depression or any other mental health conditions, it\u2019s so important to seek qualified, professional support with that, to process the experiences, thoughts & feelings that might feed into your low mood.\n\nI\u2019m by far no fitness guru but I found myself in my early middle age with a fat belly & a pair of moobs & that was my starting point, after always being skinny until my mid 30s.\n\nAs a kid, I always loved swimming & cycling so I got back into those sports, hiking & just some good cardiovascular exercise. It was all these things in combination that made a difference for me during an initial 2-3 year period of change.\n\nFinally, I just want to salute you for having the courage to make this post. I think it was brave & courageous. \n\nAs men our bodies can & do change a lot over a lifetime, for many different reasons. But as others here have commented, you\u2019re 21 & you\u2019re fortunate to have time & youthful energy on your side. \n\nI hope you can find a way forwards with whatever changes you might decide to make. It\u2019ll seem difficult at first but the buzz of achievement came for me when I began to experience significant improvements in my stamina & I think whatever approach you chose to take it\u2019s important to enjoy the process. \n\nBe kind & patient with yourself & don\u2019t give yourself a hard time if you can\u2019t always keep to your fitness schedule. Just one day at a time, step by step, steady progress will bring the changes you seek. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to lose your hair at such a young age but with a wider focus on your health & wellbeing you\u2019ll be in a position 5 years from now (probably much sooner) to be able to look yourself in the mirror & feel really good about the man you see looking back at you: mind, body & soul. All the best with it brother! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

The new suicide hotline is 988. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re suicidal, but you don\u2019t have to be suicidal to call them. They are willing to help you with any mental or emotional problem \u2013 and they are good.\n\nAs far as hair advice goes, the first thing I thought was that you should shave everything off your head except your eyebrows and eyelashes :)\n\nPattyPreston (I have to remember her name, after a glance, because if I go back to look, I may lose my comment), will have a hard time convincing me that she\u2019s not a doctor.\n\nI recommend that you follow Patty\u2018s advice. If I looked like you, I would be depressed. And I am quite aware that I am not Paul Newman. But improving your looks and how you feel about your looks can definitely help to alleviate depression.\n\nYes, you should work on your looks, your wardrobe, but most of all you should seek help for your depression.\n\nUntreated depression can have very, very bad consequences. How you look is not important. Research Gandhi, Jesus, Mother Theresa, people like that. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to look good but it\u2019s not something that is necessary to keep you alive. I am not saying that your life is in danger, but I really, really want you to look into addressing any mental health issues - immediately. The look on your face worries me. Address your health first.\n\nI wish you peace.\n\nPS  I am a doctor . . . of English. So please take what I have written as sincere advice from a caring stranger and nothing more.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll probably take some hits for \u201cdiagnosing you with depression\u201d; I am not doing that. It is just that - every word you write has depression in it. Call 988, they will give you good advice. And if they tell you that I am a fool; believe them.",

You might want to look into micro dosing psilocybin. It literally saved my life. I had depression so bad, even though my life and work was going great, I couldn't even get out of bed for days/weeks at a time. I nearly lost everything I had built for myself and I nearly ended it. Micro dosing mushrooms (grinding into a powder and packing into 0.25g capsules for before bed a few times a week) massively helped my depression and anxiety. You can take different doses at different times of the day based off what you need but bottom line is/was the only thing to ever help me. With them I was able to take more steps to improve my life. I couldn't have taken the steps like hit the gym, take care of my hair, get back to work, and get back to meeting people with out it.\n\nI hope you find a solution that works for you. No one deserves crippling depression and so many don't understand what it is even if they're affected by it so it's hard to find support.",

Shit like depression is not easy to deal with and there is a reason why depression is a common illness. You shouldn't downplay mental illness just because you luckily haven't experienced it and can't relate to the feeling. Get to know more people and don't go through the world so obtuse. You're not helping anyone or yourself that way. Fam Mac Miller even struggled with that shit and people would think he should have been happy. He wasnt tho. Grow up",

It has done wonders for me and I know it could for you, too. As soon as you see that change in your outward appearance, it will be like a feedback loop. Your confidence is bolstered and you find yourself wanting to work out more. \n\nYou got this, dude.",

Now this doesn't necessarily mean you can't have your favourite foods but instead of take away, cook it yourself or go to an actual restaurant and have it there. I know it may be more expensive but some things are worth it and you may not have the time but this is where you need to make time.\n\nGym is another, workouts are great for caring the body and giving it the energy release it needs. But you've got to enjoy it too so start with walking or running in nice areas, get you body used to being on the move. At home workouts are great if you don't want to go to the gym and there are heaps of tutorials on YouTube to follow.\n\nOn the hair stuff, I don't really have a way to grow it back as I've never tried. Chat with the right people about it but if it was me I would just shave it. If you don't like the look you can always wear a hat. I know its not exactly the best thing to do for body positivity but it works, my brother wore hats to cover his baldness and he now doesn't give a fuck. \n\nHope all this helps my man",

Best nothing is more important than your happiness and your mental health, not even money. \n\nI'll be honest with you, life is never going to be easy, but believe me when I say this there is always light at the end of the tunnel, I remember seeing this video which I found super inspiring. There were two men, who were both gemstone miners, let's call them Jim and Tim. Both Jim and Tim were mining for many hours, when Jim came across a diamond, which as you can expect, seeing this Tim start to dig even fast in hopes he could find a diamond too, many hours later, feeling heartened, Tim continued to dig each time revealing nothing but a patch of dirt. After countless hours he decided to give up digging, yet unbeknown to him a meter further was a cluster of diamonds. Which if he had continued to dig for just a little while longer he would have found. Even though this story ends on a negative note, you should consider what the object of the story was, it demonstrates that sometimes when you feel like there is no hope, hope is just around the corner you just have to stand strong for just a little while longer. Because there is always a better day tomorrow. \n\nI see everyday as a new life, an opportunity to be and do what I want to do. You have to understand that sometimes it's ok to not be ok. We all have those days, but please remember there's nothing really stopping us from making more of those  days good days.",

After that, the workout routines you do can be easily found online. I recommend starting with Compound Movements and getting the technique down before adding on much weight as its easy to get injured otherwise.\n\nI used to count calories and do \"bulks\" and \"cuts\" but realized if you're not a competitive bodybuilder, you don't have to do that.

You\u2019ll look better with it cut off and you can be on treatment while shaving to get the benefits of any possible regrowth while also looking good as you\u2019re waiting. Then in 6 months to a year or so, allow it to get a bit longer and see if you\u2019ve had a response. If not you can just shave it again.",

It'll change your life.\n\nCheck with a dermatologist about tretinion. It's great for your skin, helps with acne, and starting early means you'll look younger than your age group for longer.\n\nAfter you do the min and fin treatments for  1-2 years you can look into a hair transplant. Fin and min take a while to maximize recovery so wait on the transplant.\n\nI have a convict head shape, haha, no really I had it buzzed in the military and it's scary so going bald wasn't an option for me. You're young so your recovery should be better than us older guys that started in our 30s. Dead follicles don't come back so the younger you start the better.\n\nAlso, hit that gym dude! Look at this year as a year to focus solely on yourself. Take pics now, put your head down, grind, and then look back up spring time of 2023. You're going to be shocked.  Start the gym slow and easy. Push yourself a little every time but most importantly just show up to the gym. If you walk through those doors you can always leave whenever but I promise you'll do at least SOMETHING when you get there.",

I can't say much because I don't know your wardrobe but I think dressing up a little will help ease you into a new look :) You got this dude! Also Heads and Shoulders is more trouble than its worth imo, definitely consult with a doc about it and if skin care is an issue I would recommend starting a new routine - My routine is 1) Cetaphil face wash in the shower 2) applying witch hazel toner with a cotton pad outside of the shower 3) with a slightly damp face applying the Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 4) using QV lotion as a final moisturiser on top! This routine works for me but may not work for everybody but hopefully it can help you get an idea!",

It's better to do what you can to improve your situation, and if working out at home is what you can do then that's absolutely a great idea.\n\nJust live day by day and take care of yourself man.

Also this might not be the safest or most relevant advice but as someone who is nearsighted and wears glasses I found that if I took my glasses off once I got to the machine or equipment I was using, it would help me forget about everyone around me because I literally blurred them out.  Also if you\u2019re really too anxious to go to the gym I would recommend doing some at home yoga on YouTube, it\u2019ll help you with your posture and body awareness and strength which will all help get your confidence up. On YouTube \u201cyoga with adriene\u201d has a couple of 30 day series, I think the one I started with was called \u201chome\u201d and I did it over the course of like a month and a half. Def recommend checking that out. I had friends commenting on my that my posture was visibly better after doing those videos for a few months.",

You might want to look into micro dosing psilocybin. It literally saved my life. I had depression so bad, even though my life and work was going great, I couldn't even get out of bed for days/weeks at a time. I nearly lost everything I had built for myself and I nearly ended it. Micro dosing mushrooms (grinding into a powder and packing into 0.25g capsules for before bed a few times a week) massively helped my depression and anxiety. You can take different doses at different times of the day based off what you need but bottom line is/was the only thing to ever help me. With them I was able to take more steps to improve my life. I couldn't have taken the steps like hit the gym, take care of my hair, get back to work, and get back to meeting people with out it.\n\nI hope you find a solution that works for you. No one deserves crippling depression and so many don't understand what it is even if they're affected by it so it's hard to find support.",

It'll change your life.\n\nCheck with a dermatologist about tretinion. It's great for your skin, helps with acne, and starting early means you'll look younger than your age group for longer.\n\nAfter you do the min and fin treatments for  1-2 years you can look into a hair transplant. Fin and min take a while to maximize recovery so wait on the transplant.\n\nI have a convict head shape, haha, no really I had it buzzed in the military and it's scary so going bald wasn't an option for me. You're young so your recovery should be better than us older guys that started in our 30s. Dead follicles don't come back so the younger you start the better.\n\nAlso, hit that gym dude! Look at this year as a year to focus solely on yourself. Take pics now, put your head down, grind, and then look back up spring time of 2023. You're going to be shocked.  Start the gym slow and easy. Push yourself a little every time but most importantly just show up to the gym. If you walk through those doors you can always leave whenever but I promise you'll do at least SOMETHING when you get there.",

Also Heads and Shoulders is more trouble than its worth imo, definitely consult with a doc about it and if skin care is an issue I would recommend starting a new routine - My routine is 1) Cetaphil face wash in the shower 2) applying witch hazel toner with a cotton pad outside of the shower 3) with a slightly damp face applying the Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 4) using QV lotion as a final moisturiser on top! This routine works for me but may not work for everybody but hopefully it can help you get an idea!",

It's not easily controllable most of the time, and then there are the times where you're basically dripping with sweat because you made a loud noise in a public space and a bunch of people looked over at you and there's not a single goddamn thought you could think that would make you feel any better, you just need to get the fuck out of there and hide. It's just so far away from what most folks experience that they can't grasp it, and they assume that it's like the anxiety they deal with.\n\nI'm glad that therapy has helped me work through some of mine (a lot of my anxiety is related to childhood physical abuse and neglect), but it took several years of sessions before I got to that point. Also clonidine. Thank God for clonidine.",

Use that, but agreed, going later is always a safe bet. And get noise canceling headphones, those helped a lot with my anxiety in the gym. Also this might not be the safest or most relevant advice but as someone who is nearsighted and wears glasses I found that if I took my glasses off once I got to the machine or equipment I was using, it would help me forget about everyone around me because I literally blurred them out.  Also if you\u2019re really too anxious to go to the gym I would recommend doing some at home yoga on YouTube, it\u2019ll help you with your posture and body awareness and strength which will all help get your confidence up. On YouTube \u201cyoga with adriene\u201d has a couple of 30 day series, I think the one I started with was called \u201chome\u201d and I did it over the course of like a month and a half. Def recommend checking that out. I had friends commenting on my that my posture was visibly better after doing those videos for a few months.",

And associate with something like that?.\nThe idea of depression is being sad due to something. Find what you are sad about and fix that.. it\u2019s the only way to improve in life. \nYou clearly are unfortunate in the fact your hairline is cooked and hair is extremely thin so shave it off and rock the bold look like many others do.\n\nNot sure how your skin is but try some skincare routines and make sure the place you sleep and live is extremely clean and that should solve your acne problems to an extent.\nGo to a gym and get more comfortable with yourself and all this will build your confidence.",

I've tried the \"hustle\" culture you seem to be into now.

It literally saved my life. I had depression so bad, even though my life and work was going great, I couldn't even get out of bed for days/weeks at a time. I nearly lost everything I had built for myself and I nearly ended it. Micro dosing mushrooms (grinding into a powder and packing into 0.25g capsules for before bed a few times a week) massively helped my depression and anxiety. You can take different doses at different times of the day based off what you need but bottom line is/was the only thing to ever help me. With them I was able to take more steps to improve my life. I couldn't have taken the steps like hit the gym, take care of my hair, get back to work, and get back to meeting people with out it.\n\nI hope you find a solution that works for you. No one deserves crippling depression and so many don't understand what it is even if they're affected by it so it's hard to find support.",

Most people at the gym these days were tiny once, or started going to make themselves feel better about their self image if that helps.",

Dunno if that's how it is for you, but some of these replies are a bit discouraging or dismissive.\n\nYou can go a hell of a long way doing stuff at home, and there's a chance that being more physically fit may help to decrease your depression symptoms somewhat. Like, being fit didn't make my depression go away, but that crushed-at-the-bottom-of-the-well feeling was at least easier to power through when I was physically fit (I'm not now, which is how I know \ud83d\ude05). It's better to do what you can to improve your situation, and if working out at home is what you can do then that's absolutely a great idea.\n\nJust live day by day and take care of yourself man.

Use that, but agreed, going later is always a safe bet. And get noise canceling headphones, those helped a lot with my anxiety in the gym. Also this might not be the safest or most relevant advice but as someone who is nearsighted and wears glasses I found that if I took my glasses off once I got to the machine or equipment I was using, it would help me forget about everyone around me because I literally blurred them out.  Also if you\u2019re really too anxious to go to the gym I would recommend doing some at home yoga on YouTube, it\u2019ll help you with your posture and body awareness and strength which will all help get your confidence up. On YouTube \u201cyoga with adriene\u201d has a couple of 30 day series, I think the one I started with was called \u201chome\u201d and I did it over the course of like a month and a half. Def recommend checking that out. I had friends commenting on my that my posture was visibly better after doing those videos for a few months.",

It literally saved my life. I had depression so bad, even though my life and work was going great, I couldn't even get out of bed for days/weeks at a time. I nearly lost everything I had built for myself and I nearly ended it. Micro dosing mushrooms (grinding into a powder and packing into 0.25g capsules for before bed a few times a week) massively helped my depression and anxiety. You can take different doses at different times of the day based off what you need but bottom line is/was the only thing to ever help me. With them I was able to take more steps to improve my life. I couldn't have taken the steps like hit the gym, take care of my hair, get back to work, and get back to meeting people with out it.\n\nI hope you find a solution that works for you. No one deserves crippling depression and so many don't understand what it is even if they're affected by it so it's hard to find support.",

Most people at the gym these days were tiny once, or started going to make themselves feel better about their self image if that helps.",

Dunno if that's how it is for you, but some of these replies are a bit discouraging or dismissive.\n\nYou can go a hell of a long way doing stuff at home, and there's a chance that being more physically fit may help to decrease your depression symptoms somewhat. Like, being fit didn't make my depression go away, but that crushed-at-the-bottom-of-the-well feeling was at least easier to power through when I was physically fit (I'm not now, which is how I know \ud83d\ude05). It's better to do what you can to improve your situation, and if working out at home is what you can do then that's absolutely a great idea.\n\nJust live day by day and take care of yourself man. I've had some pretty dark periods in my life and showing myself some kindness and understanding has helped me make it through those times.",

Also this might not be the safest or most relevant advice but as someone who is nearsighted and wears glasses I found that if I took my glasses off once I got to the machine or equipment I was using, it would help me forget about everyone around me because I literally blurred them out.  Also if you\u2019re really too anxious to go to the gym I would recommend doing some at home yoga on YouTube, it\u2019ll help you with your posture and body awareness and strength which will all help get your confidence up. On YouTube \u201cyoga with adriene\u201d has a couple of 30 day series, I think the one I started with was called \u201chome\u201d and I did it over the course of like a month and a half. Def recommend checking that out. I had friends commenting on my that my posture was visibly better after doing those videos for a few months.",

It literally saved my life. I had depression so bad, even though my life and work was going great, I couldn't even get out of bed for days/weeks at a time. I nearly lost everything I had built for myself and I nearly ended it. Micro dosing mushrooms (grinding into a powder and packing into 0.25g capsules for before bed a few times a week) massively helped my depression and anxiety. You can take different doses at different times of the day based off what you need but bottom line is/was the only thing to ever help me. With them I was able to take more steps to improve my life. I couldn't have taken the steps like hit the gym, take care of my hair, get back to work, and get back to meeting people with out it.\n\nI hope you find a solution that works for you. No one deserves crippling depression and so many don't understand what it is even if they're affected by it so it's hard to find support.",

Use that, but agreed, going later is always a safe bet. And get noise canceling headphones, those helped a lot with my anxiety in the gym. Also this might not be the safest or most relevant advice but as someone who is nearsighted and wears glasses I found that if I took my glasses off once I got to the machine or equipment I was using, it would help me forget about everyone around me because I literally blurred them out.  Also if you\u2019re really too anxious to go to the gym I would recommend doing some at home yoga on YouTube, it\u2019ll help you with your posture and body awareness and strength which will all help get your confidence up. On YouTube \u201cyoga with adriene\u201d has a couple of 30 day series, I think the one I started with was called \u201chome\u201d and I did it over the course of like a month and a half. Def recommend checking that out. I had friends commenting on my that my posture was visibly better after doing those videos for a few months.",
