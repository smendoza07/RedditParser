    "body": "Ok in my metro are there is a local chain of retro arcade/bars. They have video games from the 80s and 90s along with pinball. On top of that they serve alcohol and its 18+ at night! This place is awesome and every SB I have ever taken there has loved it. TBH the fact that SBs really love this place really surprised me, I would have never expected a 20yo girl to enjoy playing games from my youth.\n\nSo on to the story - I took my new SB there today, she is a massive gamer and is even into a lot of retro games. She was in heaven. Being that she is a gamer she was SUPER competitive and taking this WAY too seriously.\n\nAs we walked around the arcade I would randomly pick games and then we would play them against each other. Every time she would be talking trash. But then some how I would kick her ass.\n\nThen we would walk around to some other random game. She would talk more trash. And then I would kick her ass even more.\n\nI have to confess something... I wasn't picking games at random. I was picking the games I know all of the tricks for.\n\nShe never stood a chance! MUHAHAHAHA!!!",

All my competitiveness somehow manifests itself on those dinky little air cooled tables. I will murder you. However! If I\u2019m playing a game with a SD? I let him win. Sure, if we\u2019re playing a few rounds I will win one in the beginning to lull him into the belief that it\u2019s a fair fight. It\u2019s a farce, though. I learned awhile ago that overly competitive men over 50 don\u2019t always handle losing gracefully. Even with stupid arcade games like air hockey. Just a thought :)",
