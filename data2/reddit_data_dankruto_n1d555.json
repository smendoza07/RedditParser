A friend of mine does the same. \"I can read a chapter when the teacher takes attendance, can't watch an episode bro\". I mean, fair point \ud83d\ude02\n\nStill, I'd say even if you can only watch a couple of episodes a day, the anime makes it well worth it. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nAlso, one thing I felt was both the anime and manga don't do much character building early on. It's fast paced and that's nice and all, but I feel like they really missed a trick to flesh out the characters and give them some backstory, ideals, goals etc from the start so that the audience can relate. That's what really makes Naruto great and among the new gen, MHA does a good job at this. Kaisen lacks in this department, but it's visually very appealing at the start so I guess it will keep the audience interested long enough to deliver proper character backstories.",

I mean, fair point \ud83d\ude02\n\nStill, I'd say even if you can only watch a couple of episodes a day, the anime makes it well worth it. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nAlso, one thing I felt was both the anime and manga don't do much character building early on. It's fast paced and that's nice and all, but I feel like they really missed a trick to flesh out the characters and give them some backstory, ideals, goals etc from the start so that the audience can relate. That's what really makes Naruto great and among the new gen, MHA does a good job at this. Kaisen lacks in this department, but it's visually very appealing at the start so I guess it will keep the audience interested long enough to deliver proper character backstories.",

I mean, fair point \ud83d\ude02\n\nStill, I'd say even if you can only watch a couple of episodes a day, the anime makes it well worth it. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nAlso, one thing I felt was both the anime and manga don't do much character building early on. It's fast paced and that's nice and all, but I feel like they really missed a trick to flesh out the characters and give them some backstory, ideals, goals etc from the start so that the audience can relate. That's what really makes Naruto great and among the new gen, MHA does a good job at this. Kaisen lacks in this department, but it's visually very appealing at the start so I guess it will keep the audience interested long enough to deliver proper character backstories.",

I mean, fair point \ud83d\ude02\n\nStill, I'd say even if you can only watch a couple of episodes a day, the anime makes it well worth it. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nAlso, one thing I felt was both the anime and manga don't do much character building early on. It's fast paced and that's nice and all, but I feel like they really missed a trick to flesh out the characters and give them some backstory, ideals, goals etc from the start so that the audience can relate. That's what really makes Naruto great and among the new gen, MHA does a good job at this. Kaisen lacks in this department, but it's visually very appealing at the start so I guess it will keep the audience interested long enough to deliver proper character backstories.",

I mean, fair point \ud83d\ude02\n\nStill, I'd say even if you can only watch a couple of episodes a day, the anime makes it well worth it. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nAlso, one thing I felt was both the anime and manga don't do much character building early on. It's fast paced and that's nice and all, but I feel like they really missed a trick to flesh out the characters and give them some backstory, ideals, goals etc from the start so that the audience can relate. That's what really makes Naruto great and among the new gen, MHA does a good job at this. Kaisen lacks in this department, but it's visually very appealing at the start so I guess it will keep the audience interested long enough to deliver proper character backstories.",

I mean, fair point \ud83d\ude02\n\nStill, I'd say even if you can only watch a couple of episodes a day, the anime makes it well worth it. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nAlso, one thing I felt was both the anime and manga don't do much character building early on. It's fast paced and that's nice and all, but I feel like they really missed a trick to flesh out the characters and give them some backstory, ideals, goals etc from the start so that the audience can relate. That's what really makes Naruto great and among the new gen, MHA does a good job at this. Kaisen lacks in this department, but it's visually very appealing at the start so I guess it will keep the audience interested long enough to deliver proper character backstories.",
