    "body": "This thread is being created as a reference point for those seeking a general idea of what is received and given in their areas by other members of our community. \n\nKeep in mind that this is the internet and that there is no way to verify how legit the numbers are. So take everything with a grain of salt and remember that there are extenuating circumstances that may affect what you yourself may expect to receive or give.\n\nPick your region and post your city or general area in this format. \n\n**Example: SB (28) Paris $700-1K weekly, includes overnights and gifts. no travel, indoor only.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* This is not a discussion thread no comments about what other people receive or give is allowed. Simply post your own info. \n\n* No rating of your sugar partners (i.e $500 for a 9 or  for old SD)\n\n* No breakdowns by hourly or sexual acts required for allowance. \n\n* Please note whether allowance is PPM, Monthly, Weekly,etc\n\n* Click reply under the green MOD  comment with the region/country you wish to contribute to and not other replies in that region. So deletions are not a problem.\n\n* Do not post your own regions or cities on this thread. If unsure where to post or if you feel something is missing contact me through this [**link**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsugarlifestyleforum)\n\nThis is where newbies asking about allowances will be referred to since these post are no longer allowed on SLF. The link to this post is on the sidebar as well for easy access.  \n\n The window for posting will be from now until April 2020.  Feel free to create as many posts as you guys want to discuss the findings on this thread but do not do here. I will ban violators. Thanks in advance to everyone who chooses to participate.",
