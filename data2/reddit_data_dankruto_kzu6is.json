What a piece of garbage. He should have died like Danzo did.\n\nTobirama never discriminated the Uchiha. He gave them jobs.\n\n\nIn case you didn't know, Danzo isn't the whole village.

(Not blaming Naruto for doing so, he\u2019s the Hokage)\n\nSasuke was actually *punished*; Danzo was ex judicially executed by Sasuke because the Leaf would never punish him, because Hiruzen didn\u2019t kill Danzo when he was alive or send him to prison.\n\nThe Nation became culpable when Hiruzen found out and didn\u2019t kill or imprison Danzo. The Hokage represents the Village. Hiruzen failed to act to stop Danzo or give him punishment. When you\u2019re silent you\u2019re culpable for evil if you don\u2019t speak out or punish it when you see it being done.\n\nThe Government (Hokage, Danzo, & advisers) all mishandled and stroked the flames that led to the Massacre. That\u2019s why the need to apologize.",

Also when Orochimaru revived all the Hokage, Sasuke said he was planning to destroy the village unless convinced otherwise prompting Tobirama to call him an evil Uchiha.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULLLhP1Rl9I?t=7m35s\n\nAll the people blaming Sasuke for this logic must have forgot that when he joined Orochimaru he refused to kill any of the people he trained against even though Orochimaru wanted him to and also when the prisoners escaped he chose not to kill any of them except for when Karin was about to be killed.\n\nVery few people wouldn't have had the reaction Sasuke did and without any positive influences how could he?\n\nItachi said Sasuke could be dyed to any color meaning he could be convinced to join Obito or protect the village  or join someone else but Itachi did nothing to guide him. He was a shitty brother until after he was revived.",

But what he didn't do, was keep Sasuke from dying. No no no, Karin did that by letting Sasuke bite her arm. Yes the guy who literally said, \"They are puny, but so bothersome. That's it, I'm leaving, gonna go home a get a drink\". Like, KB was literally just going to fucking leave because he was tired of kicking their asses, and if KARIN, not Sasuke, hadn't located him through her Chakra sensory ability, he'd have ducked out and they would've been clueless bruh. Then, he just goes basic cloak mode, breaks Sasukes genjutsu, and Lariat's the fuck out of him, to the point Jugo says, \"his vital organs are fucked, and his chest and neck, he's beyond our help now\", so he's obviously dying. The Jugo whips out that awesome, \"make shit up and protect Sasuke plot armor\", by sharing his body and Chakra with Sasuke via the cm, and that's just to keep him alive. Then Sasuke, who has already been healed and brought back to life TWICE, uses Amaterasu, and manages to walk away.... With a substitution. Yeah dude. Sasuke clearly won this, omg Sasuke. Such badass. Dude, it's questionable to even say that Team Taka beat KB, much less Sasuke by himself.",

That's like saying that Boruto beat Momoshiki, because it was his Rasengan that took Momoshiki down in the end, even though it was Sasuke and Naruto who fought him the entire time.

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

They used the Hidden Rain Village as a battleground to protect their interests. \n\nThe Leaf enjoyed peace that Itachi gave them; because they were so self-absorbed and filled with unfounded hate for a clan that they feared the power of. When it came time for the Uchiha to defend the village during the Kyuubi attack they did that; and proudly defended their village. In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination. When they finally get fed up with being treated like dirt the Village leaders let them be slaughtered without any sort of punishment for Danzo and continued to let him keep power, with Sasuke having to execute him.\n\nDo you really think if the Village was told the truth they would just let Sasuke walk in and kill the Elders & Danzo?

Uchiha were over-privileged conceited cops. Tobirama was too generous to them and gave them jobs [to make them part of the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ElbQ8oVXIAM1wGf?format=jpg&name=360x360).

You're directly contracting canon.\n\nWe don't even know how the Second War began so again, stop making up bullshit.\n\n\nI get it, you love these ridiculous Uchiha characters.

Hiruzen didn\u2019t give a damn about the genocide after the fact that it happened and he continued to let Danzo operate in the government.

How did they know it wasn\u2019t a lone wolf attack? you literally had Uchiha helping people during the attack, if they were in on it; common sense tells you they would\u2019ve joined in. But they didn\u2019t. They stuck by their village and were ostracized and blamed for it. Then massacred for good measure. \n\n- Both Obito & Madara died, and neither of them claim or are worshipped as good models to emulate. the Leaf pretends to be peaceful and all about love when it has its hands dipped in just as much blood as they do",

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha.

Also when Orochimaru revived all the Hokage, Sasuke said he was planning to destroy the village unless convinced otherwise prompting Tobirama to call him an evil Uchiha.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULLLhP1Rl9I?t=7m35s\n\nAll the people blaming Sasuke for this logic must have forgot that when he joined Orochimaru he refused to kill any of the people he trained against even though Orochimaru wanted him to and also when the prisoners escaped he chose not to kill any of them except for when Karin was about to be killed.\n\nVery few people wouldn't have had the reaction Sasuke did and without any positive influences how could he?\n\nItachi said Sasuke could be dyed to any color meaning he could be convinced to join Obito or protect the village  or join someone else but Itachi did nothing to guide him. He was a shitty brother until after he was revived.",

But what he didn't do, was keep Sasuke from dying. No no no, Karin did that by letting Sasuke bite her arm. Yes the guy who literally said, \"They are puny, but so bothersome. That's it, I'm leaving, gonna go home a get a drink\". Like, KB was literally just going to fucking leave because he was tired of kicking their asses, and if KARIN, not Sasuke, hadn't located him through her Chakra sensory ability, he'd have ducked out and they would've been clueless bruh. Then, he just goes basic cloak mode, breaks Sasukes genjutsu, and Lariat's the fuck out of him, to the point Jugo says, \"his vital organs are fucked, and his chest and neck, he's beyond our help now\", so he's obviously dying. The Jugo whips out that awesome, \"make shit up and protect Sasuke plot armor\", by sharing his body and Chakra with Sasuke via the cm, and that's just to keep him alive. Then Sasuke, who has already been healed and brought back to life TWICE, uses Amaterasu, and manages to walk away.... With a substitution. Yeah dude. Sasuke clearly won this, omg Sasuke. Such badass. Dude, it's questionable to even say that Team Taka beat KB, much less Sasuke by himself.",

That's like saying that Boruto beat Momoshiki, because it was his Rasengan that took Momoshiki down in the end, even though it was Sasuke and Naruto who fought him the entire time.

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination. When they finally get fed up with being treated like dirt the Village leaders let them be slaughtered without any sort of punishment for Danzo and continued to let him keep power, with Sasuke having to execute him.\n\nDo you really think if the Village was told the truth they would just let Sasuke walk in and kill the Elders & Danzo?

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha.

Also when Orochimaru revived all the Hokage, Sasuke said he was planning to destroy the village unless convinced otherwise prompting Tobirama to call him an evil Uchiha.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULLLhP1Rl9I?t=7m35s\n\nAll the people blaming Sasuke for this logic must have forgot that when he joined Orochimaru he refused to kill any of the people he trained against even though Orochimaru wanted him to and also when the prisoners escaped he chose not to kill any of them except for when Karin was about to be killed.\n\nVery few people wouldn't have had the reaction Sasuke did and without any positive influences how could he?\n\nItachi said Sasuke could be dyed to any color meaning he could be convinced to join Obito or protect the village  or join someone else but Itachi did nothing to guide him. He was a shitty brother until after he was revived.",

But what he didn't do, was keep Sasuke from dying. No no no, Karin did that by letting Sasuke bite her arm. Yes the guy who literally said, \"They are puny, but so bothersome. That's it, I'm leaving, gonna go home a get a drink\". Like, KB was literally just going to fucking leave because he was tired of kicking their asses, and if KARIN, not Sasuke, hadn't located him through her Chakra sensory ability, he'd have ducked out and they would've been clueless bruh. Then, he just goes basic cloak mode, breaks Sasukes genjutsu, and Lariat's the fuck out of him, to the point Jugo says, \"his vital organs are fucked, and his chest and neck, he's beyond our help now\", so he's obviously dying. The Jugo whips out that awesome, \"make shit up and protect Sasuke plot armor\", by sharing his body and Chakra with Sasuke via the cm, and that's just to keep him alive. Then Sasuke, who has already been healed and brought back to life TWICE, uses Amaterasu, and manages to walk away.... With a substitution. Yeah dude. Sasuke clearly won this, omg Sasuke. Such badass. Dude, it's questionable to even say that Team Taka beat KB, much less Sasuke by himself.",

Lol, dude, no one in the world, even most Sasuke fanbois like yourself think Sasuke won.

That's like saying that Boruto beat Momoshiki, because it was his Rasengan that took Momoshiki down in the end, even though it was Sasuke and Naruto who fought him the entire time.

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination. When they finally get fed up with being treated like dirt the Village leaders let them be slaughtered without any sort of punishment for Danzo and continued to let him keep power, with Sasuke having to execute him.\n\nDo you really think if the Village was told the truth they would just let Sasuke walk in and kill the Elders & Danzo?

Hiruzen didn\u2019t give a damn about the genocide after the fact that it happened and he continued to let Danzo operate in the government.

But they didn\u2019t. They stuck by their village and were ostracized and blamed for it. Then massacred for good measure. \n\n- Both Obito & Madara died, and neither of them claim or are worshipped as good models to emulate. the Leaf pretends to be peaceful and all about love when it has its hands dipped in just as much blood as they do",

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha.

Also when Orochimaru revived all the Hokage, Sasuke said he was planning to destroy the village unless convinced otherwise prompting Tobirama to call him an evil Uchiha.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULLLhP1Rl9I?t=7m35s\n\nAll the people blaming Sasuke for this logic must have forgot that when he joined Orochimaru he refused to kill any of the people he trained against even though Orochimaru wanted him to and also when the prisoners escaped he chose not to kill any of them except for when Karin was about to be killed.\n\nVery few people wouldn't have had the reaction Sasuke did and without any positive influences how could he?\n\nItachi said Sasuke could be dyed to any color meaning he could be convinced to join Obito or protect the village  or join someone else but Itachi did nothing to guide him.

But what he didn't do, was keep Sasuke from dying. No no no, Karin did that by letting Sasuke bite her arm. Yes the guy who literally said, \"They are puny, but so bothersome. That's it, I'm leaving, gonna go home a get a drink\". Like, KB was literally just going to fucking leave because he was tired of kicking their asses, and if KARIN, not Sasuke, hadn't located him through her Chakra sensory ability, he'd have ducked out and they would've been clueless bruh. Then, he just goes basic cloak mode, breaks Sasukes genjutsu, and Lariat's the fuck out of him, to the point Jugo says, \"his vital organs are fucked, and his chest and neck, he's beyond our help now\", so he's obviously dying. The Jugo whips out that awesome, \"make shit up and protect Sasuke plot armor\", by sharing his body and Chakra with Sasuke via the cm, and that's just to keep him alive. Then Sasuke, who has already been healed and brought back to life TWICE, uses Amaterasu, and manages to walk away.... With a substitution. Yeah dude. Sasuke clearly won this, omg Sasuke. Such badass. Dude, it's questionable to even say that Team Taka beat KB, much less Sasuke by himself.",

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha.

Also when Orochimaru revived all the Hokage, Sasuke said he was planning to destroy the village unless convinced otherwise prompting Tobirama to call him an evil Uchiha.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULLLhP1Rl9I?t=7m35s\n\nAll the people blaming Sasuke for this logic must have forgot that when he joined Orochimaru he refused to kill any of the people he trained against even though Orochimaru wanted him to and also when the prisoners escaped he chose not to kill any of them except for when Karin was about to be killed.\n\nVery few people wouldn't have had the reaction Sasuke did and without any positive influences how could he?\n\nItachi said Sasuke could be dyed to any color meaning he could be convinced to join Obito or protect the village  or join someone else but Itachi did nothing to guide him.

Like I said, if you want to say Taka won, that's fine, but you're trying to tell me that SASUKE won, just because he's the one who landed Amaterasu on KB, when Jugo, Suigetsu were both fighting Bee, and Karin is bringing Sasuke back to life. That's like saying that Boruto beat Momoshiki, because it was his Rasengan that took Momoshiki down in the end, even though it was Sasuke and Naruto who fought him the entire time. Gtfo with that lame-ass shit",

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

They state they were trying to kill enemy ninja. They used the Hidden Rain Village as a battleground to protect their interests. \n\nThe Leaf enjoyed peace that Itachi gave them; because they were so self-absorbed and filled with unfounded hate for a clan that they feared the power of. When it came time for the Uchiha to defend the village during the Kyuubi attack they did that; and proudly defended their village. In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination. When they finally get fed up with being treated like dirt the Village leaders let them be slaughtered without any sort of punishment for Danzo and continued to let him keep power, with Sasuke having to execute him.\n\nDo you really think if the Village was told the truth they would just let Sasuke walk in and kill the Elders & Danzo?

He literally says that verbatim when he says goodbye to Naruto & Sakura at the end of Shippuden. Not to mention he also stopped Madara and Kaguya *with* Naruto. Have you forgotten why he\u2019s been away from the Village for so long? He states he needs to pay for his sins and even goes to *jail* even after he did what he did for the world with Naruto. \n\nEveryone else is doing fuck all in Boruto but Sasuke except Naruto who\u2019s busy being Hokage. While Sasuke is out doing all the dirty work and gathering intel/fighting the threat that\u2019s coming to threaten the entire world everyone else sits on their ass. (Not blaming Naruto for doing so, he\u2019s the Hokage)\n\nSasuke was actually *punished*; Danzo was ex judicially executed by Sasuke because the Leaf would never punish him, because Hiruzen didn\u2019t kill Danzo when he was alive or send him to prison.\n\nThe Nation became culpable when Hiruzen found out and didn\u2019t kill or imprison Danzo. The Hokage represents the Village. Hiruzen failed to act to stop Danzo or give him punishment. When you\u2019re silent you\u2019re culpable for evil if you don\u2019t speak out or punish it when you see it being done.\n\nThe Government (Hokage, Danzo, & advisers) all mishandled and stroked the flames that led to the Massacre.

Lol, dude, no one in the world, even most Sasuke fanbois like yourself think Sasuke won. Like I said, if you want to say Taka won, that's fine, but you're trying to tell me that SASUKE won, just because he's the one who landed Amaterasu on KB, when Jugo, Suigetsu were both fighting Bee, and Karin is bringing Sasuke back to life. That's like saying that Boruto beat Momoshiki, because it was his Rasengan that took Momoshiki down in the end, even though it was Sasuke and Naruto who fought him the entire time.

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

They used the Hidden Rain Village as a battleground to protect their interests. \n\nThe Leaf enjoyed peace that Itachi gave them; because they were so self-absorbed and filled with unfounded hate for a clan that they feared the power of.

In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination.

Your mindset is exactly like his though, just as he blamed a whole clan for someone's attack on Konoha, you're blaming an entire village for an authority's evil. Smh, so silly.",

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is.

Also when Orochimaru revived all the Hokage, Sasuke said he was planning to destroy the village unless convinced otherwise prompting Tobirama to call him an evil Uchiha.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULLLhP1Rl9I?t=7m35s\n\nAll the people blaming Sasuke for this logic must have forgot that when he joined Orochimaru he refused to kill any of the people he trained against even though Orochimaru wanted him to and also when the prisoners escaped he chose not to kill any of them except for when Karin was about to be killed.\n\nVery few people wouldn't have had the reaction Sasuke did and without any positive influences how could he?\n\nItachi said Sasuke could be dyed to any color meaning he could be convinced to join Obito or protect the village  or join someone else but Itachi did nothing to guide him.

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

The Hokage represents the Village and he should\u2019ve held Danzo accountable for his crimes and killed him on the spot. He didn\u2019t; he opted to let a child take the blame for his and the Leaf\u2019s failure to reassure, protect, and treat their citizens as equals. \n\n- The Second Hokage created the issue when he segregated the Uchiha; and of course the Village continued to let unfounded hate & prejudice against the Uchiha fester. Obito didn\u2019t cause distrust; the ignorance of the Third, Danzo, and the Elders did. \n\n- We see Leaf Shinobi kill Nagato\u2019s parents. Why else would they be there other than to wage war? They state they were trying to kill enemy ninja. They used the Hidden Rain Village as a battleground to protect their interests. \n\nThe Leaf enjoyed peace that Itachi gave them; because they were so self-absorbed and filled with unfounded hate for a clan that they feared the power of. When it came time for the Uchiha to defend the village during the Kyuubi attack they did that; and proudly defended their village. In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination. When they finally get fed up with being treated like dirt the Village leaders let them be slaughtered without any sort of punishment for Danzo and continued to let him keep power, with Sasuke having to execute him.\n\nDo you really think if the Village was told the truth they would just let Sasuke walk in and kill the Elders & Danzo? No, they\u2019d fight to protect them. For the Leaf it\u2019s peace & power at any cost.",

That's when distrust was bred and even Obito said as much. It happened decades after the second Hokage and had nothing to do with him. Your Naruto knowledge is awful. Everything you say is bullshit. Stop. You keep sucking up to the Uchiha to make them look like angels when they were terrible in canon.

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Especially as a nation? You seem to love the Uchiha very much but people don't owe shit to these characters. Danzo and some Uchiha caused the Uchiha massacre.\n\nBy your logic, Sasuke, Sarada and Sakura should spend the rest of their lives paying reparations to shinobi world because the Uchiha screwed up everything and caused so much disaster.\n\n* Sasuke served Obito like a bitch, the guy more responsible than Danzo for his clan's demise. Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha. That's justice.",

While Sasuke is out doing all the dirty work and gathering intel/fighting the threat that\u2019s coming to threaten the entire world everyone else sits on their ass. (Not blaming Naruto for doing so, he\u2019s the Hokage)\n\nSasuke was actually *punished*; Danzo was ex judicially executed by Sasuke because the Leaf would never punish him, because Hiruzen didn\u2019t kill Danzo when he was alive or send him to prison.\n\nThe Nation became culpable when Hiruzen found out and didn\u2019t kill or imprison Danzo. The Hokage represents the Village. Hiruzen failed to act to stop Danzo or give him punishment. When you\u2019re silent you\u2019re culpable for evil if you don\u2019t speak out or punish it when you see it being done.\n\nThe Government (Hokage, Danzo, & advisers) all mishandled and stroked the flames that led to the Massacre.

What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

He didn\u2019t; he opted to let a child take the blame for his and the Leaf\u2019s failure to reassure, protect, and treat their citizens as equals. \n\n- The Second Hokage created the issue when he segregated the Uchiha; and of course the Village continued to let unfounded hate & prejudice against the Uchiha fester. Obito didn\u2019t cause distrust; the ignorance of the Third, Danzo, and the Elders did. \n\n- We see Leaf Shinobi kill Nagato\u2019s parents. Why else would they be there other than to wage war? They state they were trying to kill enemy ninja. They used the Hidden Rain Village as a battleground to protect their interests. \n\nThe Leaf enjoyed peace that Itachi gave them; because they were so self-absorbed and filled with unfounded hate for a clan that they feared the power of. When it came time for the Uchiha to defend the village during the Kyuubi attack they did that; and proudly defended their village. In return they got unfounded accusations, mistreatment and discrimination. When they finally get fed up with being treated like dirt the Village leaders let them be slaughtered without any sort of punishment for Danzo and continued to let him keep power, with Sasuke having to execute him.\n\nDo you really think if the Village was told the truth they would just let Sasuke walk in and kill the Elders & Danzo? No, they\u2019d fight to protect them. For the Leaf it\u2019s peace & power at any cost.",

That's when distrust was bred and even Obito said as much. It happened decades after the second Hokage and had nothing to do with him. Your Naruto knowledge is awful. Everything you say is bullshit. Stop. You keep sucking up to the Uchiha to make them look like angels when they were terrible in canon. This is embarrassing.\n\n* Oh maybe it was a world war and people were defending themselves, hell the Konoha shinobi tried to apologise to him but Nagato killed them. It was war, you dummy.\n\nNever mind that, Sasuke shouldn't walk free, he should be a slave to ninja nations and atone for his shitty clan's mistakes according to your logic. Lmao",

Especially as a nation? You seem to love the Uchiha very much but people don't owe shit to these characters. Danzo and some Uchiha caused the Uchiha massacre.\n\nBy your logic, Sasuke, Sarada and Sakura should spend the rest of their lives paying reparations to shinobi world because the Uchiha screwed up everything and caused so much disaster.\n\n* Sasuke served Obito like a bitch, the guy more responsible than Danzo for his clan's demise. Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha. That's justice.",

He states he needs to pay for his sins and even goes to *jail* even after he did what he did for the world with Naruto. \n\nEveryone else is doing fuck all in Boruto but Sasuke except Naruto who\u2019s busy being Hokage. While Sasuke is out doing all the dirty work and gathering intel/fighting the threat that\u2019s coming to threaten the entire world everyone else sits on their ass. (Not blaming Naruto for doing so, he\u2019s the Hokage)\n\nSasuke was actually *punished*; Danzo was ex judicially executed by Sasuke because the Leaf would never punish him, because Hiruzen didn\u2019t kill Danzo when he was alive or send him to prison.\n\nThe Nation became culpable when Hiruzen found out and didn\u2019t kill or imprison Danzo. The Hokage represents the Village. Hiruzen failed to act to stop Danzo or give him punishment. When you\u2019re silent you\u2019re culpable for evil if you don\u2019t speak out or punish it when you see it being done.\n\nThe Government (Hokage, Danzo, & advisers) all mishandled and stroked the flames that led to the Massacre.

I'm still waiting for an answer on how Sasuke beats Bee one on one, considering Bee had stuck two swords in Sasuke, kicked him across the field, and was bringing down the killing blow when Suigetsu stopped him. Go ahead. I'll wait  \n\nOnce again it doens tmatter what you ask, sasuke fighting bee alone is irrelevent because that scenario didnt happen, however sasuke, jugo, suigetsu fighting bee happened, just like the fact that suigetsu took tailed beast bomb in the face and only got knocked out, the fact that jugo saved sasuke by merging with him happened karin healing sasuke happened, sasuke using amaterasu to save everyone and taking bee down in which he substituted a clone of tentacle happened, those are all scenarios which have happened, and now heres you claiming that end result of the fight that bee beat sasuke in this fight, which didnt happened, did bee stabbed sasuke with his swords and almost kill him -yes, that still doesnt change the FACT that bee had to substitute with a clone to survive the encounter. What you claim is that bee won because he almost killed sasuke a few times is retarded.",

Hiruzen didn\u2019t give a damn about the genocide after the fact that it happened and he continued to let Danzo operate in the government. That\u2019s complacency and the Hokage represents the Village. \n\n- They had ZERO proof the clan organized the attack. How did they know it wasn\u2019t a lone wolf attack? you literally had Uchiha helping people during the attack, if they were in on it; common sense tells you they would\u2019ve joined in. But they didn\u2019t. They stuck by their village and were ostracized and blamed for it. Then massacred for good measure. \n\n- Both Obito & Madara died, and neither of them claim or are worshipped as good models to emulate. the Leaf pretends to be peaceful and all about love when it has its hands dipped in just as much blood as they do",

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Danzo and some Uchiha caused the Uchiha massacre.\n\nBy your logic, Sasuke, Sarada and Sakura should spend the rest of their lives paying reparations to shinobi world because the Uchiha screwed up everything and caused so much disaster.\n\n* Sasuke served Obito like a bitch, the guy more responsible than Danzo for his clan's demise. Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha.

Hiruzen didn\u2019t give a damn about the genocide after the fact that it happened and he continued to let Danzo operate in the government.

Then massacred for good measure. \n\n- Both Obito & Madara died, and neither of them claim or are worshipped as good models to emulate. the Leaf pretends to be peaceful and all about love when it has its hands dipped in just as much blood as they do",

Hiruzen should\u2019ve killed Danzo right where he stood. \n\n- I\u2019m arguing that the Leaf as a Nation should at the least *admit* to their crimes and apologize to Sasuke & all the others who\u2019s lives they destroyed. They don\u2019t even do that. Not even privately in case you\u2019re worried about Itachi\u2019s wish to keep it secret.\n\n\n- Again Danzo was NOT punished by the Leaf. Sasuke killed him. That\u2019s not being held accountable by the Village that you acted for; that\u2019s Sasuke taking things into his own hands and delivering justice that the Leaf refused to. This isn\u2019t about Obito or Madara they don\u2019t *belong* to any type of government or authority. The buck stops with the Leaf. Sarutobi, Danzo, and the Elders are all culpable and represent the Leaf Village that *claims* to be about the \u201cWill Of Fire\u201d and doing what\u2019s right. When it was time to do what was right the entire system failed.\n\nEvery time Naruto gets in Sasuke\u2019s face to preach it makes me sick. He doesn\u2019t get it . The Village destroyed Sasuke\u2019s entire family; and used his beloved brother as a tool, then abandoned him framing him for their evil. \n\nThe moment Sarutobi found out what happened and didn\u2019t kill Danzo was the moment the Village became culpable.",

Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha.

LMAO, so ridiculous.\n\nUchiha were privileged and the elite [as said in canon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjR8c6xWsAAr_XI?format=png&name=small) in a village where other clans had to sell flowers or run food chains to make a living. Uchiha were over-privileged conceited cops. Tobirama was too generous to them and gave them jobs [to make them part of the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ElbQ8oVXIAM1wGf?format=jpg&name=360x360). Even Hashirama shuts his stupid mouth once he hears Tobirama's words.\n\nStop making up bullshit. You're directly contracting canon.\n\nWe don't even know how the Second War began so again, stop making up bullshit.\n\n\nI get it, you love these ridiculous Uchiha characters. But it's obvious you don't know much about Naruto. You slandering other characters won't make the Uchiha less shitty. Your logic is as nonsensical as Danzo's.",

You seem to love the Uchiha very much but people don't owe shit to these characters. Danzo and some Uchiha caused the Uchiha massacre.\n\nBy your logic, Sasuke, Sarada and Sakura should spend the rest of their lives paying reparations to shinobi world because the Uchiha screwed up everything and caused so much disaster.\n\n* Sasuke served Obito like a bitch, the guy more responsible than Danzo for his clan's demise. Sasuke is actually guilty. He never expressed expresses any regret, unsurprisingly enough. Danzo had covered up his crimes, have you forgotten that? Hiruzen was dead and those two old geezers thought Itachi had gone mad and killed his clan of his own free will. No one in the village knew what he had done\n\nSo you're not making sense.\n\n\nI'm sorry but it's so Danzo-ish that you are faulting an entire village for one guy's action. It's weird. It was stated repeatedly Hiruzen was weak and scared of having the village fall apart if he stopped Danzo and Danzo's influence was too strong. He stood against Danzo as much as he could. He admitted to this. So I don't know what your problem is. Danzo isn't the whole village and it's hilarious how much you share his mindset, lmao.\n\nNever mind that, by your logic Sasuke should go and serve all ninja nations for free for the rest of his life and pay for the dirty actions of other Uchiha. That's justice.",
