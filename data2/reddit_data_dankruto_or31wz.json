Theres number of ways to manipulate tension, tournaments arcs mastered doing it with small series about 5 minutes between fights. Not entire mini filler arcs to make the final arc of the story feel like slow first act. The biggest joke is that series blew its whole load on madara fight only to decide nvm final boss is this lass called kaguya. I like the series but fucking realize its legit harder to find shitier examples of macro writing than that war. You'd have to put it directly opposites to series that gives a  shit about pace like snk to really see the diffrence thou.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Although OP is only like 3/4 of the way through if that and knowing Oda he can easily add to that on without even thinking about it. Honestly I just hope he is able to finish with his health intact, but at least with the schedule he\u2019s on now he has enough free time to actually sleep. Just curious is Kishimoto still heavily involved in the series. I\u2019m always looking for something to pick up while OP is on break. Should probably get a hobby.",

Mainly read the other Big Two to kill time, and because I hate  feeling left out. Can\u2019t go wrong when it comes to Ninjas and Death Gods. Titans either for that matter. I loved the story of an orphan boy\u2019s journey to gaining the respect of his village and becoming their leader, but there is just something so appealing about a man who seeks nothing less than the freedom to do whatever he wants shouting \u201cI\u2019m an the man who will become Pirate King\u201d every damn die of his life until he overthrows his tyrranical government, the world on it\u2019s head and makes his dreams (along with the rest of his nakama) a reality. Aside from it\u2019s ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time, I suppose it\u2019s the mystery of the Void Century and the Will of D. that does it for me. Naruto was cool too though (way better than Bleach). Believe it.\n\nETA: Time skip arc? Not sure how that works exactly although I guess One Piece sorta had it\u2019s own mini timeskip arc. I got at least one week a month where I can\u2019t read One Piece so now might not be a bad time to pick it back up.",

Honestly the dude never had the commitment to tackle a monster like One Piece. \u201cOne Piece Kai\u201d sounds like a good substitute though.",

I don't need to watch the flashback about the whale from the beginning of the story every single arc. Every time Brook does ANYTHING of note, you see a flashback about the whale. Love mr whale dude, excited to know the series will end with Luffy and Brook kicking it with the whale, but like. I know the whale exists, I don't need to be reminded of him every 10 episodes. Not to mention, it's like a full 2 minute flashback every single time he shows back up.",

It\u2019s just generally assumed that they develop new techniques on their own time. God though, don\u2019t get me started on Hueco Mundo. It\u2019s the whole reason I started reading the manga. By the time I caught up we were already on the Aizen arc. Dodged a bullet there. Didn\u2019t mind the filler so much in Naruto but I started reading the manga sometime after Shippuden started. Patience was never one of my virtues. Speaking of looking for something to read while One Piece is on break. Got any suggestions? A fellow redditor recommended DBGT since that was my gap in Dragonball but I\u2019m open to other suggestions.               \n\nETA: Was it just me or did the entire second half of Bleach feel like Hueco Mundo without any payoff? Like wth was Kubo thinking doubling the length of the series if he didn\u2019t want to finish. He had a perfect ending point at Aizen. I would feel entirely different about it if we had gotten an ending, but when he is at the finish line he just blueballs us. Don\u2019t get me wrong there were plenty of enjoyable moments it\u2019s just towards the end it seemed like he just gave up.",

Hinamatsuri is a fine comedy manga, which is pretty rare, and it tries not to overstay its welcome. If you\u2019re fine with some gore, Hokuto no Ken is a fun read, and of course there\u2019s always JoJo. \n\nKubo\u2019s problem with Bleach (which many other manga artists struggle with) was that each time Bleach was extended, he had to find something new to add to a story that could have finished right then and there. Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going. This pressure from editors and fans to keep the story going is why it\u2019s difficult to find a manga / anime with consistent pacing and a good ending.",

Skull Joke) and Jojo I\u2019ve seen a bit of and heard great things about both, but for some reason I just never committed. I would for the mothafuckin references though. \n\nGlad that you put it like that with Kubo though. Here I was thinking he was a moneygrubbing whore that got off on leaving their clients unsatisfied. Jokes on him though. I\u2019m a pirate at heart. In all seriousness though I guess I didn\u2019t realize the amount of pressure he was under to the editors and even us. If you\u2019re gonna double the run time the Quincy saga would be the way to do it. It did have some very enjoyable moments.

That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

IIRC One Piece was originally supposed to end at like 800 chapters, and now it\u2019s looking to be roughly 1500. We\u2019re nearing the Endgame though. Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wano goes into the new year. Oda had me hooked since Arlong Park though so I\u2019m on this voyage until the end.",

I mean for a series as long as this one it definitely cuts down on the time invested. Although I did start out watching the anime until I was current, and have no regrets. I just prefer the manga in general because you get only the source material. Actually I just found out about this today. Don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this. Have you ever heard of One Pace? It\u2019s supposed to be an edited version of the anime that mainly sticks to what was covered in the manga. So basically like One Piece Kai. Haven\u2019t checked it out myself, but it seems right up your alley.",

Theres number of ways to manipulate tension, tournaments arcs mastered doing it with small series about 5 minutes between fights. Not entire mini filler arcs to make the final arc of the story feel like slow first act. The biggest joke is that series blew its whole load on madara fight only to decide nvm final boss is this lass called kaguya. I like the series but fucking realize its legit harder to find shitier examples of macro writing than that war. You'd have to put it directly opposites to series that gives a  shit about pace like snk to really see the diffrence thou.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Although OP is only like 3/4 of the way through if that and knowing Oda he can easily add to that on without even thinking about it. Honestly I just hope he is able to finish with his health intact, but at least with the schedule he\u2019s on now he has enough free time to actually sleep. Just curious is Kishimoto still heavily involved in the series. I\u2019m always looking for something to pick up while OP is on break. Should probably get a hobby.",

Mainly read the other Big Two to kill time, and because I hate  feeling left out. Can\u2019t go wrong when it comes to Ninjas and Death Gods. Titans either for that matter. I loved the story of an orphan boy\u2019s journey to gaining the respect of his village and becoming their leader, but there is just something so appealing about a man who seeks nothing less than the freedom to do whatever he wants shouting \u201cI\u2019m an the man who will become Pirate King\u201d every damn die of his life until he overthrows his tyrranical government, the world on it\u2019s head and makes his dreams (along with the rest of his nakama) a reality. Aside from it\u2019s ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time, I suppose it\u2019s the mystery of the Void Century and the Will of D. that does it for me. Naruto was cool too though (way better than Bleach). Believe it.\n\nETA: Time skip arc? Not sure how that works exactly although I guess One Piece sorta had it\u2019s own mini timeskip arc. I got at least one week a month where I can\u2019t read One Piece so now might not be a bad time to pick it back up.",

You can read a chapter faster than you can watch an episode, and the best part, no filler. Tried checking out One Piece abridged or \u201cNone Piece\u201d, but that series has been dead in the water for years.

It\u2019s just generally assumed that they develop new techniques on their own time. God though, don\u2019t get me started on Hueco Mundo. It\u2019s the whole reason I started reading the manga. By the time I caught up we were already on the Aizen arc. Dodged a bullet there. Didn\u2019t mind the filler so much in Naruto but I started reading the manga sometime after Shippuden started. Patience was never one of my virtues. Speaking of looking for something to read while One Piece is on break. Got any suggestions? A fellow redditor recommended DBGT since that was my gap in Dragonball but I\u2019m open to other suggestions.               \n\nETA: Was it just me or did the entire second half of Bleach feel like Hueco Mundo without any payoff? Like wth was Kubo thinking doubling the length of the series if he didn\u2019t want to finish. He had a perfect ending point at Aizen. I would feel entirely different about it if we had gotten an ending, but when he is at the finish line he just blueballs us. Don\u2019t get me wrong there were plenty of enjoyable moments it\u2019s just towards the end it seemed like he just gave up.",

If you\u2019re fine with some gore, Hokuto no Ken is a fun read, and of course there\u2019s always JoJo. \n\nKubo\u2019s problem with Bleach (which many other manga artists struggle with) was that each time Bleach was extended, he had to find something new to add to a story that could have finished right then and there. Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going. This pressure from editors and fans to keep the story going is why it\u2019s difficult to find a manga / anime with consistent pacing and a good ending.",

That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

IIRC One Piece was originally supposed to end at like 800 chapters, and now it\u2019s looking to be roughly 1500. We\u2019re nearing the Endgame though. Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wano goes into the new year. Oda had me hooked since Arlong Park though so I\u2019m on this voyage until the end.",

Although I did start out watching the anime until I was current, and have no regrets. I just prefer the manga in general because you get only the source material. Actually I just found out about this today. Don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this. Have you ever heard of One Pace? It\u2019s supposed to be an edited version of the anime that mainly sticks to what was covered in the manga. So basically like One Piece Kai. Haven\u2019t checked it out myself, but it seems right up your alley.",

Theres number of ways to manipulate tension, tournaments arcs mastered doing it with small series about 5 minutes between fights. Not entire mini filler arcs to make the final arc of the story feel like slow first act. The biggest joke is that series blew its whole load on madara fight only to decide nvm final boss is this lass called kaguya. I like the series but fucking realize its legit harder to find shitier examples of macro writing than that war. You'd have to put it directly opposites to series that gives a  shit about pace like snk to really see the diffrence thou.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Although OP is only like 3/4 of the way through if that and knowing Oda he can easily add to that on without even thinking about it. Honestly I just hope he is able to finish with his health intact, but at least with the schedule he\u2019s on now he has enough free time to actually sleep.

I loved the story of an orphan boy\u2019s journey to gaining the respect of his village and becoming their leader, but there is just something so appealing about a man who seeks nothing less than the freedom to do whatever he wants shouting \u201cI\u2019m an the man who will become Pirate King\u201d every damn die of his life until he overthrows his tyrranical government, the world on it\u2019s head and makes his dreams (along with the rest of his nakama) a reality. Aside from it\u2019s ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time, I suppose it\u2019s the mystery of the Void Century and the Will of D. that does it for me. Naruto was cool too though (way better than Bleach). Believe it.\n\nETA: Time skip arc? Not sure how that works exactly although I guess One Piece sorta had it\u2019s own mini timeskip arc. I got at least one week a month where I can\u2019t read One Piece so now might not be a bad time to pick it back up.",

You can read a chapter faster than you can watch an episode, and the best part, no filler.

It\u2019s just generally assumed that they develop new techniques on their own time. God though, don\u2019t get me started on Hueco Mundo. It\u2019s the whole reason I started reading the manga. By the time I caught up we were already on the Aizen arc. Dodged a bullet there. Didn\u2019t mind the filler so much in Naruto but I started reading the manga sometime after Shippuden started. Patience was never one of my virtues. Speaking of looking for something to read while One Piece is on break. Got any suggestions? A fellow redditor recommended DBGT since that was my gap in Dragonball but I\u2019m open to other suggestions.               \n\nETA: Was it just me or did the entire second half of Bleach feel like Hueco Mundo without any payoff? Like wth was Kubo thinking doubling the length of the series if he didn\u2019t want to finish. He had a perfect ending point at Aizen. I would feel entirely different about it if we had gotten an ending, but when he is at the finish line he just blueballs us. Don\u2019t get me wrong there were plenty of enjoyable moments it\u2019s just towards the end it seemed like he just gave up.",

If you\u2019re fine with some gore, Hokuto no Ken is a fun read, and of course there\u2019s always JoJo. \n\nKubo\u2019s problem with Bleach (which many other manga artists struggle with) was that each time Bleach was extended, he had to find something new to add to a story that could have finished right then and there. Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going. This pressure from editors and fans to keep the story going is why it\u2019s difficult to find a manga / anime with consistent pacing and a good ending.",

That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

IIRC One Piece was originally supposed to end at like 800 chapters, and now it\u2019s looking to be roughly 1500. We\u2019re nearing the Endgame though. Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wano goes into the new year. Oda had me hooked since Arlong Park though so I\u2019m on this voyage until the end.",

Theres number of ways to manipulate tension, tournaments arcs mastered doing it with small series about 5 minutes between fights. Not entire mini filler arcs to make the final arc of the story feel like slow first act. The biggest joke is that series blew its whole load on madara fight only to decide nvm final boss is this lass called kaguya. I like the series but fucking realize its legit harder to find shitier examples of macro writing than that war. You'd have to put it directly opposites to series that gives a  shit about pace like snk to really see the diffrence thou.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Although OP is only like 3/4 of the way through if that and knowing Oda he can easily add to that on without even thinking about it. Honestly I just hope he is able to finish with his health intact, but at least with the schedule he\u2019s on now he has enough free time to actually sleep. Just curious is Kishimoto still heavily involved in the series. I\u2019m always looking for something to pick up while OP is on break. Should probably get a hobby.",

I loved the story of an orphan boy\u2019s journey to gaining the respect of his village and becoming their leader, but there is just something so appealing about a man who seeks nothing less than the freedom to do whatever he wants shouting \u201cI\u2019m an the man who will become Pirate King\u201d every damn die of his life until he overthrows his tyrranical government, the world on it\u2019s head and makes his dreams (along with the rest of his nakama) a reality. Aside from it\u2019s ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time, I suppose it\u2019s the mystery of the Void Century and the Will of D. that does it for me. Naruto was cool too though (way better than Bleach). Believe it.\n\nETA: Time skip arc? Not sure how that works exactly although I guess One Piece sorta had it\u2019s own mini timeskip arc. I got at least one week a month where I can\u2019t read One Piece so now might not be a bad time to pick it back up.",

In fact, I would say pretty much all of them are crucial to the plot unless it was about a filler character. That\u2019s why I enjoy the manga over the anime though. You can read a chapter faster than you can watch an episode, and the best part, no filler. Tried checking out One Piece abridged or \u201cNone Piece\u201d, but that series has been dead in the water for years. Honestly the dude never had the commitment to tackle a monster like One Piece. \u201cOne Piece Kai\u201d sounds like a good substitute though.",

Patience was never one of my virtues. Speaking of looking for something to read while One Piece is on break. Got any suggestions? A fellow redditor recommended DBGT since that was my gap in Dragonball but I\u2019m open to other suggestions.               \n\nETA: Was it just me or did the entire second half of Bleach feel like Hueco Mundo without any payoff? Like wth was Kubo thinking doubling the length of the series if he didn\u2019t want to finish. He had a perfect ending point at Aizen. I would feel entirely different about it if we had gotten an ending, but when he is at the finish line he just blueballs us.

Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going.

That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs.

Although I did start out watching the anime until I was current, and have no regrets. I just prefer the manga in general because you get only the source material. Actually I just found out about this today. Don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this. Have you ever heard of One Pace? It\u2019s supposed to be an edited version of the anime that mainly sticks to what was covered in the manga. So basically like One Piece Kai. Haven\u2019t checked it out myself, but it seems right up your alley.",

Theres number of ways to manipulate tension, tournaments arcs mastered doing it with small series about 5 minutes between fights. Not entire mini filler arcs to make the final arc of the story feel like slow first act. The biggest joke is that series blew its whole load on madara fight only to decide nvm final boss is this lass called kaguya. I like the series but fucking realize its legit harder to find shitier examples of macro writing than that war. You'd have to put it directly opposites to series that gives a  shit about pace like snk to really see the diffrence thou.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Can\u2019t go wrong when it comes to Ninjas and Death Gods. Titans either for that matter. I loved the story of an orphan boy\u2019s journey to gaining the respect of his village and becoming their leader, but there is just something so appealing about a man who seeks nothing less than the freedom to do whatever he wants shouting \u201cI\u2019m an the man who will become Pirate King\u201d every damn die of his life until he overthrows his tyrranical government, the world on it\u2019s head and makes his dreams (along with the rest of his nakama) a reality. Aside from it\u2019s ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time, I suppose it\u2019s the mystery of the Void Century and the Will of D. that does it for me. Naruto was cool too though (way better than Bleach). Believe it.\n\nETA: Time skip arc? Not sure how that works exactly although I guess One Piece sorta had it\u2019s own mini timeskip arc. I got at least one week a month where I can\u2019t read One Piece so now might not be a bad time to pick it back up.",

It\u2019s just generally assumed that they develop new techniques on their own time. God though, don\u2019t get me started on Hueco Mundo. It\u2019s the whole reason I started reading the manga. By the time I caught up we were already on the Aizen arc. Dodged a bullet there. Didn\u2019t mind the filler so much in Naruto but I started reading the manga sometime after Shippuden started. Patience was never one of my virtues. Speaking of looking for something to read while One Piece is on break. Got any suggestions? A fellow redditor recommended DBGT since that was my gap in Dragonball but I\u2019m open to other suggestions.               \n\nETA: Was it just me or did the entire second half of Bleach feel like Hueco Mundo without any payoff? Like wth was Kubo thinking doubling the length of the series if he didn\u2019t want to finish. He had a perfect ending point at Aizen. I would feel entirely different about it if we had gotten an ending, but when he is at the finish line he just blueballs us. Don\u2019t get me wrong there were plenty of enjoyable moments it\u2019s just towards the end it seemed like he just gave up.",

If you\u2019re fine with some gore, Hokuto no Ken is a fun read, and of course there\u2019s always JoJo. \n\nKubo\u2019s problem with Bleach (which many other manga artists struggle with) was that each time Bleach was extended, he had to find something new to add to a story that could have finished right then and there. Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going. This pressure from editors and fans to keep the story going is why it\u2019s difficult to find a manga / anime with consistent pacing and a good ending.",

                                            "body": "I\u2019d say JoJo part 1 is the shortest and easiest to pick up, as it only runs for less than 50 issues. That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wano goes into the new year. Oda had me hooked since Arlong Park though so I\u2019m on this voyage until the end.",

Theres number of ways to manipulate tension, tournaments arcs mastered doing it with small series about 5 minutes between fights. Not entire mini filler arcs to make the final arc of the story feel like slow first act. The biggest joke is that series blew its whole load on madara fight only to decide nvm final boss is this lass called kaguya. I like the series but fucking realize its legit harder to find shitier examples of macro writing than that war. You'd have to put it directly opposites to series that gives a  shit about pace like snk to really see the diffrence thou.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Can\u2019t go wrong when it comes to Ninjas and Death Gods. Titans either for that matter. I loved the story of an orphan boy\u2019s journey to gaining the respect of his village and becoming their leader, but there is just something so appealing about a man who seeks nothing less than the freedom to do whatever he wants shouting \u201cI\u2019m an the man who will become Pirate King\u201d every damn die of his life until he overthrows his tyrranical government, the world on it\u2019s head and makes his dreams (along with the rest of his nakama) a reality. Aside from it\u2019s ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time, I suppose it\u2019s the mystery of the Void Century and the Will of D. that does it for me. Naruto was cool too though (way better than Bleach). Believe it.\n\nETA: Time skip arc? Not sure how that works exactly although I guess One Piece sorta had it\u2019s own mini timeskip arc. I got at least one week a month where I can\u2019t read One Piece so now might not be a bad time to pick it back up.",

By the time I caught up we were already on the Aizen arc. Dodged a bullet there. Didn\u2019t mind the filler so much in Naruto but I started reading the manga sometime after Shippuden started. Patience was never one of my virtues. Speaking of looking for something to read while One Piece is on break. Got any suggestions? A fellow redditor recommended DBGT since that was my gap in Dragonball but I\u2019m open to other suggestions.               \n\nETA: Was it just me or did the entire second half of Bleach feel like Hueco Mundo without any payoff? Like wth was Kubo thinking doubling the length of the series if he didn\u2019t want to finish. He had a perfect ending point at Aizen. I would feel entirely different about it if we had gotten an ending, but when he is at the finish line he just blueballs us.

                    "body": "Slam Dunk! and Hajime no Ippo are pretty solid sports manga with good artstyles, and there\u2019s more than enough material there for several binges. Hinamatsuri is a fine comedy manga, which is pretty rare, and it tries not to overstay its welcome. If you\u2019re fine with some gore, Hokuto no Ken is a fun read, and of course there\u2019s always JoJo. \n\nKubo\u2019s problem with Bleach (which many other manga artists struggle with) was that each time Bleach was extended, he had to find something new to add to a story that could have finished right then and there. Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going. This pressure from editors and fans to keep the story going is why it\u2019s difficult to find a manga / anime with consistent pacing and a good ending.",

My dad named me after a basketball player even though I got no game, and my buddy recommended Hajime to me back when used to smack each other around for fun. Not sure what Hinamatsuri is but I always love a good laugh. Northstar (speaking of I would love to hear Brooke say Omae wo Shindaeru just once. Like Brooke. Skull Joke) and Jojo I\u2019ve seen a bit of and heard great things about both, but for some reason I just never committed. I would for the mothafuckin references though. \n\nGlad that you put it like that with Kubo though. Here I was thinking he was a moneygrubbing whore that got off on leaving their clients unsatisfied. Jokes on him though. I\u2019m a pirate at heart. In all seriousness though I guess I didn\u2019t realize the amount of pressure he was under to the editors and even us. If you\u2019re gonna double the run time the Quincy saga would be the way to do it. It did have some very enjoyable moments. I was just disappointed that we didn\u2019t get closure with some of the characters, especially the main one. Still would love to see that final Bleach movie I\u2019ve been hearing about though.",

                                    "body": "I\u2019d say JoJo part 1 is the shortest and easiest to pick up, as it only runs for less than 50 issues. That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs.

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

You can read a chapter faster than you can watch an episode, and the best part, no filler. Tried checking out One Piece abridged or \u201cNone Piece\u201d, but that series has been dead in the water for years. Honestly the dude never had the commitment to tackle a monster like One Piece. \u201cOne Piece Kai\u201d sounds like a good substitute though.",

Hinamatsuri is a fine comedy manga, which is pretty rare, and it tries not to overstay its welcome. If you\u2019re fine with some gore, Hokuto no Ken is a fun read, and of course there\u2019s always JoJo. \n\nKubo\u2019s problem with Bleach (which many other manga artists struggle with) was that each time Bleach was extended, he had to find something new to add to a story that could have finished right then and there. Sometimes this transition was fairly smooth, but the Quincy arc felt like a clumsy attempt to soft-reboot the series and keep it going. This pressure from editors and fans to keep the story going is why it\u2019s difficult to find a manga / anime with consistent pacing and a good ending.",

Skull Joke) and Jojo I\u2019ve seen a bit of and heard great things about both, but for some reason I just never committed. I would for the mothafuckin references though. \n\nGlad that you put it like that with Kubo though. Here I was thinking he was a moneygrubbing whore that got off on leaving their clients unsatisfied. Jokes on him though. I\u2019m a pirate at heart. In all seriousness though I guess I didn\u2019t realize the amount of pressure he was under to the editors and even us. If you\u2019re gonna double the run time the Quincy saga would be the way to do it. It did have some very enjoyable moments.

That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

Like in my case I rewatched the episode 370 to 393 so many times that I have lost count. Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

Every time Brook does ANYTHING of note, you see a flashback about the whale. Love mr whale dude, excited to know the series will end with Luffy and Brook kicking it with the whale, but like. I know the whale exists, I don't need to be reminded of him every 10 episodes. Not to mention, it's like a full 2 minute flashback every single time he shows back up.",

My dad named me after a basketball player even though I got no game, and my buddy recommended Hajime to me back when used to smack each other around for fun. Not sure what Hinamatsuri is but I always love a good laugh. Northstar (speaking of I would love to hear Brooke say Omae wo Shindaeru just once. Like Brooke. Skull Joke) and Jojo I\u2019ve seen a bit of and heard great things about both, but for some reason I just never committed. I would for the mothafuckin references though. \n\nGlad that you put it like that with Kubo though. Here I was thinking he was a moneygrubbing whore that got off on leaving their clients unsatisfied. Jokes on him though. I\u2019m a pirate at heart. In all seriousness though I guess I didn\u2019t realize the amount of pressure he was under to the editors and even us. If you\u2019re gonna double the run time the Quincy saga would be the way to do it. It did have some very enjoyable moments. I was just disappointed that we didn\u2019t get closure with some of the characters, especially the main one. Still would love to see that final Bleach movie I\u2019ve been hearing about though.",

                    "body": "I\u2019d say JoJo part 1 is the shortest and easiest to pick up, as it only runs for less than 50 issues. That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

Luffy has to defeat at least 2 of the Yonkou before the Final War. After this arc we should at least have a Revolutionary Arc, an Elbaf Arc, he has to reach >!Logue Star!< and find the last >!Road Poneglyph!< before the true Endgame, and you know how Oda is his with his arcs.

Why? Cause I liked it. And I am not telling you not liking it is bad, people have their own impression of things.\n\nWhat my point is, to the story, it diidnt became redundant and always breathed new things, which added depth to the already known power system and the storyline. Like the concept of Obito's attack being of Shadow and Light concept, how we coursed through Obito's character as a whole, the origin story of Sage of the six paths and chakra and ninjutsu as a whole, and mainly the fact that all the tailed beast's chakra are of Senjutsu, which gives a overall outlook of the chakra system. These whole stuff were given through the course of fights after Obito became the Ten tails Jinchuriki to when he was defeated.\n\nIt basically saved the narrative with having a long fight by doing information dump during then... Kinda a good way to do information dump Ngl",

That\u2019s enough time to check out Araki\u2019s art style and the JoJo ambience, and of course there are the later parts if you\u2019re interested. \nPart 1 was heavily based on Fist of the North Star, which has some really amazing battle scenes. It starts to slow near the end (around issue 200 imo) when the story runs out of steam and wraps up, but there are some amazing panels throughout. Most fights involve heavily-muscled men punching each other until their bodies explode, and as bloody as it is, it\u2019s entertaining to watch. \nHajime is a solid manga with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s longer than One Piece and still ongoing. Unfortunately, the protagonist is kinda passive, and unlike One Piece, the end of his journey is still unclear. Still, Morikawa\u2019s art style and panel layout leads to some beautiful spreads, and the anime adaptations have all been fairly good. Plus, I learned a surprising amount of boxing vocabulary just from the manga. \nThe protag of Slam Dunk starts off with zero game, and he gets a great character arc over the year that follows. He\u2019s a very Ichigo-like protagonist, maybe more of a delinquent, but still likeable and energetic. \nHinamatsuri is about a gangster who accidentally adopts a girl with telekinetic powers, and how he copes with becoming a father. It\u2019s well worth the read, and hits all the right comedy notes. \n\n\nBleach\u2019s problems have all happened to almost any work that\u2019s been serialized. Kishimoto was burning out near the end of Naruto because of the pressure of putting out an entire chapter each week, plus trying to keep the series afloat until it reaches a good stopping point. Pok\u00e9mon has to reboot itself each \u201cseason\u201d to keep improving on the preceding games. Hunter x Hunter has been in and out of hiatus hell since 2014. It\u2019s sad, but these are ultimately human artists creating series that we know and love, and they\u2019re flawed too. Miura\u2019s recent passing is just another reminder of how fortunate we are to have these series, flaws and all.",

Honestly the dude never had the commitment to tackle a monster like One Piece. \u201cOne Piece Kai\u201d sounds like a good substitute though.",

I know the whale exists, I don't need to be reminded of him every 10 episodes. Not to mention, it's like a full 2 minute flashback every single time he shows back up.",
