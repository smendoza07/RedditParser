Is it yours?\n\nMe: Yes, it\u2019s mine!\n\nMom: You bought patio furniture? (My mom knows I can\u2019t afford to buy patio furniture)\n\nMe: It was a gift.\n\nMom: From who?\n\nMe: T. (My mom knows I\u2019m dating a guy named T., that he\u2019s 15 years older than me and what he does for work/makes a lot of money)\n\nMom: Who gives someone patio furniture? \n\nMe: Well, I told him I wanted it.\n\nMom: Well, that was nice!\n\nMe: *laughs* Yeah!\n\n\nMom: I guess that\u2019s what happens when you have a sugar daddy!\n\nMe: PFFFFFFTT Whatever *awkward laugh*\n\nThen we both say goodbye and hang up.  \n\nAlso for shits and giggles, I\u2019ll mention that my parents are only 7 years older than my SD.",

(which included the woman I was with;  who was 15 years younger, and way more beautiful then I had any vanilla business with, regardless of the age).  I made a couple of comments of... the women I date know it's a casual relationship, we do fun things, enjoy time together.  But they know I'm not looking to get married/have kids.\n\nHer response?  As long as everyone is honest about it, and it's a mutually beneficial relationship, there is nothing wrong with that.  Then she started telling me how - her sister used to date older guys growing up and always got gifts.",

I never got away with anything as a kid and that\u2019s not ever going to change- no matter how old I am!  Nothing gets past them!  I knew this would be something that might eventually come out.  I think I did a pretty good job easing them into it though. And they don\u2019t seem to ask as many questions as they would if I were dating someone closer to my age.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s totally out there because I usually date men older than me. Before my SD, the last guy I dated was 8 years older than me. \n\nGranny knows what\u2019s up!",

So she asked how old he really is and I told her. She asked if it was weird to me that I was dating someone closer to their age. He is 15 years older than me and 7 years younger than my parents. I nonchalantly told her no.  It\u2019s not odd for me to date older men. I rarely date guys my age. I\u2019ve dated up to 8 years older than myself.  So, I\u2019m hoping my parents don\u2019t see it as too strange.. but, my parents aren\u2019t stupid. They can put two and two together. Hopefully, moving forward, they just don\u2019t ask too many questions or want too many details. \n\nI mean, we\u2019re all adults here. There are plenty of celebrity couples/people with big age gaps. It\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s out there.

But, I\u2019ve also told her that I\u2019m not in a place right now where I want this to evolve into anything more than \u201cdating\u201d.  \n\nWhen I first told my mom about my SD, he actually showed up on \u201cpeople you may know\u201d on fb because we are fb friends. So she asked how old he really is and I told her. She asked if it was weird to me that I was dating someone closer to their age. He is 15 years older than me and 7 years younger than my parents. I nonchalantly told her no.  It\u2019s not odd for me to date older men. I rarely date guys my age. I\u2019ve dated up to 8 years older than myself.  So, I\u2019m hoping my parents don\u2019t see it as too strange.. but, my parents aren\u2019t stupid. They can put two and two together. Hopefully, moving forward, they just don\u2019t ask too many questions or want too many details. \n\nI mean, we\u2019re all adults here. There are plenty of celebrity couples/people with big age gaps. It\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s out there. And I think it helps to point those facts out to people who aren\u2019t used to the idea.",

But, I\u2019ve also told her that I\u2019m not in a place right now where I want this to evolve into anything more than \u201cdating\u201d.  \n\nWhen I first told my mom about my SD, he actually showed up on \u201cpeople you may know\u201d on fb because we are fb friends. So she asked how old he really is and I told her. She asked if it was weird to me that I was dating someone closer to their age. He is 15 years older than me and 7 years younger than my parents. I nonchalantly told her no.  It\u2019s not odd for me to date older men. I rarely date guys my age. I\u2019ve dated up to 8 years older than myself.  So, I\u2019m hoping my parents don\u2019t see it as too strange.. but, my parents aren\u2019t stupid. They can put two and two together. Hopefully, moving forward, they just don\u2019t ask too many questions or want too many details. \n\nI mean, we\u2019re all adults here. There are plenty of celebrity couples/people with big age gaps. It\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s out there. And I think it helps to point those facts out to people who aren\u2019t used to the idea.",

            "body": "My mom is usually all up in my dating business, but since she has found out about the guy (SD) I\u2019m currently dating, I feel like she asks less questions. But, I\u2019ve also told her that I\u2019m not in a place right now where I want this to evolve into anything more than \u201cdating\u201d.  \n\nWhen I first told my mom about my SD, he actually showed up on \u201cpeople you may know\u201d on fb because we are fb friends. So she asked how old he really is and I told her. She asked if it was weird to me that I was dating someone closer to their age. He is 15 years older than me and 7 years younger than my parents. I nonchalantly told her no.  It\u2019s not odd for me to date older men. I rarely date guys my age. I\u2019ve dated up to 8 years older than myself.  So, I\u2019m hoping my parents don\u2019t see it as too strange.. but, my parents aren\u2019t stupid. They can put two and two together. Hopefully, moving forward, they just don\u2019t ask too many questions or want too many details. \n\nI mean, we\u2019re all adults here. There are plenty of celebrity couples/people with big age gaps. It\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s out there. And I think it helps to point those facts out to people who aren\u2019t used to the idea.",
