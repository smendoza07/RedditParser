    "body": "I'm shopping with a new SB last week. Let's call her Jackie. That's the name she gave me. \n\nWe stop by a popular makeup store and I buy her some stuff. It's about $250 worth of stuff and the clerk asks her if she is a rewards member because there's a $50 bonus coming to her if she is. \n\nShe immediately says YES and proceeds to tell him her email address, which is her real first and last name @ gmail. \n\nEleven minutes later, in the mall bathroom, I'm googling her and finding her mugshots from arrests for identity theft, drug possession, domestic violence. \n\n  ",
