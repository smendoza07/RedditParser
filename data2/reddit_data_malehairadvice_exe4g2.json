The only difference between a fade and a taper is that a taper originates exclusively in the nape and sideburns. A fade connects the two.\n\n If this was done with a traditional fade it would be brought up slightly higher in order to connect the back and sides, which is a shorter but just as fashionable version of the cut. It will take longer to grow it out too, which is nice if you can't get into the barber every 4 weeks!",

I'm not sure if there's a difference between the two block cut and two block hairstyle to he honest. But the two block cut is almost like an Asian undercut. Where the undercut starts lower if I'm not wrong so it fits Asian heads I can't remember where I got this info from though, so take it with a grain of salt. The hair is cut mostly with a \"fade\" on the sides. For most I have seen the fade on the sides is a tad bit unorthodox. Because the hair is a little longer on the top side of the fade to create a natural round/bowl ish shape.\n\nTwo blocks can be short to long.\n\nFrom then on you can style your hair in quite a few different ways. This looks a little like a 2/3 part or maybe a little closer to a side in the front though. From the back I can't tell much.",

The only difference between a fade and a taper is that a taper originates exclusively in the nape and sideburns. A fade connects the two.\n\n If this was done with a traditional fade it would be brought up slightly higher in order to connect the back and sides, which is a shorter but just as fashionable version of the cut. It will take longer to grow it out too, which is nice if you can't get into the barber every 4 weeks!",
