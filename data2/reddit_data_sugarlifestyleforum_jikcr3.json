    "body": "Do you do \"extras\" for your SDs / SBs?\n\nAs an SB, I spend overnights occasionally, I give (REALLY GOOD) massages often, I get small meaningful gifts for them, and I either suggest or willing to try new things for private times, all without being asked explicitly. Those were not part of the arrangement. But I do them because I want to make them feel good and because I feel those things make a relationship more genuine and less transactional, less businessy.\n\nBut I feel like many SDs don't do extras, and whenever that happens, it leaves me feeling like our relationship is transactional and I feel objectified. What do I mean by the \"extras\" that an SD could and should do? Birthday gift/s, holiday gift/s, unexpected emergencies like a broken or stolen phone, car issues, job loss, healthcare costs that pop up, things of that sort.\n\nOften these same SDs tout they're not interested or wanting a transactional relationship, but it's hard not to feel that way when they stick to the amount agreed on and nothing more. They're treating it TRANSACTIONAL but simultaneously claim that's not what they want. It seems like they don't want to go even three extra steps, let alone the extra mile, and I don't know how to navigate the feelings or lopsided situation.",

Once the money side has been simplified such that it doesn't require a conversation anymore, it otherwise feels just like a vanilla relationship.  \n\nMaybe it's time to think about \"next\"ing your SD and finding another one?  He's clearly not putting in the same level of effort you are.",

There were some other minor gifts which she appreciated plus some very special care. \n\n Two weeks later her car broke down just after she left Coachella.

He called it a down payment for the next time, which I thought was really nice. We didn't meet again until a month later. I certainly didn't expect him to give me a full ppm the next time we met, but I thought he might at least give *something*, even a little token such as chocolate or a bottle of wine so as not to show up empty handed. Well, no such luck. He didn't bring it up at all. I felt a bit hurt like he was just coming over to get his money's worth and leave. \n\nIt is a bit confusing and disappointing that many SDs I've encountered don't seem to try to take care of their SBs in this way, and it feels hard to ask for something like that because it's something I want them to do because *they* want to. /rant",

And I love that unstructured awesomeness, I love the texting in between, telling her I've got her mani/pedi today, her impulsively sleeping over,  me picking out something awesome for her birthday, and on and on.\n\nOf course, the awesomeness may be unstructured, but our efforts should be roughly symmetric.  If one of us is going above and beyond, and the other is doing the bare minimum, that doesn't work.   Nothing wrong with doing the bare minimum, if a quid pro quo NSA arrangement is what someone wants, all they need to do is find someone who is looking for the same, there's all kinds in the bowl.  But I like my SRs to feature lots and lots of extras, relationship-type activities, unstructured awesomeness, whatever you want to call it",

I had a previous arrangement but i didnt go looking for it maybe thats why it worked out so well but he would send me gifts and money just because. sometimes i would wake up to cash app and a text saying treat myself today. If it was a saturday i could ask for some cash to go out with friends. This was just how he had things but that ended and now im noticing these guys are not doing that. Now i may be new to this but having a \"transactional\" situation like that feels like escorting and to my knowledge that is not what a sugar baby is and i have had to say this to multiple men when they are looking for a \"pay per meet\" arrangement. That is not a sugar baby and i am sooo tiered of saying that. I have had no luck finding a legit arrangement that is what i would want and i totally agree with you about the extras on your part its like be good to me i'll be good to you.

I think the better thing is to decide if the SR will work for you, or not.\n\nIf you want something more relationship driven - start looking again.\n\nIf you are \"satisfied\" with the transactional relationship itself - this is the last thing you want to do.  Okay - maybe give up the overnights - and give up buying them gifts.  But, massages?  Trying new things?  That's what keeps the person from finding someone else.\n\nMy point being - if you decide you are happy with it being transactional - don't fool yourself.  Stopping those things are very likely going to make find someone else.",

The post is clear on that.\n\nIt seems like your only purpose here is to keep arguing.  I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",

Give my SB massages - cook dinner for her sometimes - etc, yes.  \n\n> but it's hard not to feel that way when they stick to the amount agreed on and nothing more.\n\nThe problem I have with this - is you seem to be viewing it as a solely favor for cash type of thing.\n\nAs in - you do what you consider \"more\" - and in turn think he'll provide more back.  \n\nThe thing is - the more an SB puts into the SR - the more I put into it.  Emotionally.  Time.  But not money.  The reality is - I have a budget.  I stick to it.  \n\n> What do I mean by the \"extras\" that an SD could and should do? Birthday gift/s, holiday gift/s, \n\nI feel like birthday/christmas gift - they belong in a separate list.  I don't see them comparable to the rest of your items.\n\n> unexpected emergencies like a broken or stolen phone, car issues, job loss, healthcare costs that pop up, things of that sort.\n\nWhy aren't you able to cover a broken/stolen phone, or car issues - from saving part of your allowance?  Likewise for health care costs.  \n\nLet's say your allowance is 100 apples a month.  Obviously this is not a real number, so I should be able to say this.\n\nIf your car/phone/health expense, is 50 apples - I would expect in an ongoing SR, you have that type of savings.  That's what savings is for.  You should have savings - to handle situations like this.  \n\nNow, let's say it's not.  Let's say while your allowance is 100 apples, this is 250 apples.  Or you mentioned losing your job.  So maybe it's 3-6 months of an extra 50 apples a month.\n\nFor many SDs - that's just not reasonable;  and not within their budget.",

And I'll make time (within reason) to see her for additional dates (platonic or intimate) beyond our weekly date night. I also discuss fun date activities/experiences that she'd like to try, and I make them happen. Things like concerts, shows, sporting events, etc are all more \"occasional\" in a typical 20-something's dating life. In my SRs, we'd have these kinds of dates at least monthly.",

Okay - maybe give up the overnights - and give up buying them gifts.  But, massages?  Trying new things?  That's what keeps the person from finding someone else.\n\nMy point being - if you decide you are happy with it being transactional - don't fool yourself.

The post is clear on that.\n\nIt seems like your only purpose here is to keep arguing.  I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",

I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",

I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",

The post is clear on that.\n\nIt seems like your only purpose here is to keep arguing.  I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",

The post is clear on that.\n\nIt seems like your only purpose here is to keep arguing.  I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",

The post is clear on that.\n\nIt seems like your only purpose here is to keep arguing.  I don't understand why.  \n\nYour original post (and I just went and read it *again*) never stated anything about your current SD not giving you a birthday card, gift, or message.  It did \"lump\" birth day & holiday gift in with the other things.  \n\nI don't plan to reply further - because it's not being productive.  But it comes back to this.  I read your post - very similiar to how he did.  And you (and others) can hate on me for it - but it's how I read the post.\n\nOnce we boil it down to - being about the birthday - well, the tune changes.  Expecting (at a minimum) a small/mid size gift + birthday text is 100% reasonable.  But that didn't come out of the original post, only through the columns.",
