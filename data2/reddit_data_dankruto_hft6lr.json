This scaling is also pretty consistent for the arc as Orochimaru says Itachi is stronger than him at the beginning of the arc, and the sannin are stated to be equals in this arc.

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

This scaling is also pretty consistent for the arc as Orochimaru says Itachi is stronger than him at the beginning of the arc, and the sannin are stated to be equals in this arc. I think all this stuff happens around the 140-146 ish range in the manga.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

If kishi left madara as the final boss, you could wrap up naruto as a tale about a conflict that came about as a result of a senju vs Uchiha conflict that lasted way too long. Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built? There's a lot of potential in the universe that I feel is almost wasted because of the aliens.",

Follow this up by exploring clans and conflicts you haven't gone into before. Ofc someone else may remember more than I do, but iirc the only real info given about the Uzumaki clan is that they have significant more Chakra on average and that they were wiped out at some point. Go into that. Maybe have a hidden Uzumaki out for revenge and give them secret abilities that naruto never learned about and boruto can figure out. Maybe they hate naruto and his family because an ancestor got exiled and eventually ended up at konoha so they want to destroy everything naruto built?
