Also, that would be a possibility even if they were in an actual field made of grass, that's the kind of injury it was.\n\nEDIT: Why is this at -3? If you watch it again, the danger was actually YSC's tackle and not the surface. If they were in an actual match that would've warranted a yellow card (but probably not a red - he did make a challenge \"for the ball\").",
