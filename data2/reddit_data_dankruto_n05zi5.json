The reincarnates theory is because I can't see anything else Naruto, Sasuke and Madara alone have in common, couple that with the fact that Hashirama was far gone in terms of strength I like my theory.\n\n It does make me wonder what would happen if Hashirama decided to steal Madara's MS though.",

The reason I think the powers aren't a result of Hagoromo giving it away is because Madara had no such meeting with him yet managed to wake a third eye, something only pure Otsutsuki's seem to have. The reincarnates theory is because I can't see anything else Naruto, Sasuke and Madara alone have in common, couple that with the fact that Hashirama was far gone in terms of strength I like my theory.\n\n It does make me wonder what would happen if Hashirama decided to steal Madara's MS though.",

So basically maybe the sage couldnt give them his powers just moments before when they still hadn't gotten the other bijuu or senju dna??",

The reason I think the powers aren't a result of Hagoromo giving it away is because Madara had no such meeting with him yet managed to wake a third eye, something only pure Otsutsuki's seem to have. The reincarnates theory is because I can't see anything else Naruto, Sasuke and Madara alone have in common, couple that with the fact that Hashirama was far gone in terms of strength I like my theory.\n\n It does make me wonder what would happen if Hashirama decided to steal Madara's MS though.",

The reason I think the powers aren't a result of Hagoromo giving it away is because Madara had no such meeting with him yet managed to wake a third eye, something only pure Otsutsuki's seem to have. The reincarnates theory is because I can't see anything else Naruto, Sasuke and Madara alone have in common, couple that with the fact that Hashirama was far gone in terms of strength I like my theory.\n\n It does make me wonder what would happen if Hashirama decided to steal Madara's MS though.",
