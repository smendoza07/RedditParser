    "body": "EDIT TO ADD: Y'all I haven't used this app in awhile! There are so many new features. You can add a timeline which is info about what you are doing and a record of last known activity to help figure out whats going on should the worst happen \n\nEXAMPLE:\n09/25/2020\nI met with pot 1 at Chili's (sad) today at 3PM. Pot 2 asked me to meet today but I was busy and he seemed upset.\n09/26/2020\nvanilla guy and I have a date today and he is picking me up and knows my address. He has a red ford focus with WA plates.\n09/26/2020\nVanilla plate number : AJS892 \n09/27/2020\nGot back from date with Vanilla at 9AM and had a great time. He was very sweet. I had a weird interaction with pot 2 via text today- he kept asking what I was doing on Friday and why I couldn't meet with him. We are supposed to meet 09/28/2020 at 5PM at Daniel's Broiler. I'm going to Uber there from my place. He offered to send me an Uber and I accepted but asked the pickup to be 3 blocks away (didn't tell him this).\n\nSee how that would be super helpful to know if you went missing? Also, in your contact info there is a spot for notes which will be used to help in an emergency! Potentially a good place to add contact info of SDs and Vanilla partners as well as SA usernames, the name of any friend you have that you use as a safety buddy, etc etc.\n\n**Also wanted to add that SDs that are calling the websites SBs and other women use to verify SD info extortion sites- they aren't. I was provided the list of them and first of all, you have to have the SDs full name and number generally to find anything out. And the only things you are finding out are how they treated other partners. No one is posting workplace info, kids schools, etc (and realistically if you have enough info to look the SD up on these sites you have enough info to find out all of those details...). I'm sure there are sites like that but these aren't it. SBs are worried about getting murdered and y'all are worried about blackmail/loss of clout/your marriage etc. Both are terrible things to have happen but there's one that is clearly worse. And don't even get me started on the risks involved in online dating and just existing let alone sugar dating for our trans and especially black trans babies!!! These sites have immense value and can save lives!**\n\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n(Or sds)\n\nHi! I\u2019ve seen an awful lot of super alarming posts on here and it\u2019s breaking my heart to know so many of you are being taken advantage of. I wanted to let everyone know about the app noonlight- essentially you keep your thumb on your screen and if you let go for more than ten seconds without entering your PIN number your info and location are sent to the police. The idea is unlike other apps someone can\u2019t disarm it for you and it\u2019s very discreet. \n\nPlease don\u2019t get into cars with people you don\u2019t know well. And please don\u2019t go to anyplace private with them. But if you find yourself nervous about being followed at night or if suddenly the vibe seems weird (eventually you\u2019ll have to be alone with your SD and there\u2019s only so much vetting one can do) it\u2019s a great safety net. \n\nLove y\u2019all stay safe \u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "Great advice. Here are some of my tried and true safety strategies.\n\n1. Have a safety person that knows where you're going and when you're supposed to return. If you change locations, text and tell them. I always share my GPS location on my iOS device with a safety person, but I also share it via google maps to my other safety person's android device. Also, keep a knife or mace on you at all times.\n2. I do a thorough google search of anyone I'm going to meet (search their username, number, and the name they gave. Also reverse search all their google images).\n3. I won't go in a car or non-public place with them until I have met them a few times and have a fair amount of information about their identity (name, place of work, address, etc.).  I have a cloud location that I upload this information to along with my calendar. If I ever go missing, my safety person knows how to access it and provide it to the authorities.\n4. Also, print off or take screenshots of the SA profile before you meet someone. That way if they block you later you can still report any abuse to the site or authorities.\n5. Use an alias and fake number until you really know someone and can trust them (this goes for SDs as well, blackmail his unfortunately really common)\n6. Don't reveal the place you work or go to school until you've gotten to know someone.\n7. Never let anyone pick you up from your home or send an Uber to your address. If you're concerned, park near the meeting spot and take an uber for the last few blocks.\n8. Always park in a well-lit area and near the entrance or security cameras. Also, never let a POT walk you to your car. If you're really concerned after you meet someone, ask a security guard or employee to walk you out.\n9. If you're traveling with a new SD or traveling to meet a POT, always book the travel (make sure it's refundable) and reservations yourself, under your name. Your SD can reimburse you and he should respect your need for safety. One reason for this is if his name is in the hotel room, he can get a key. If he booked the flights, he can cancel your return flight, etc.\n10. Don't give your personal or bank info to an SD unless you REALLY know them (and never to someone you haven't met!!!). They can use other apps to send you cash if needed, it doesn't have to go through a wire transfer that might require a lot of personal information.\n11. If you have kids, for all that is holy please don't disclose any personal information about where they go to school, their names, or pictures of them, etc. Protect yourself and babies like their lives depend on it!!! This also goes for SDs with minor children... please use some common sense and consider your wife and family.",

Also, any real SD is going to give you his real name and phone number, once a little trust is established because a good guy wants you to feel comfortable and safe...or you can figure out who he is pretty quickly with hints about his company or what he does, then look up his business, company(ies), Bloomberg, news articles, ect. as he will have an online presence.",

That\u2019s so sketch.\n\nIf blackmail is such a paranoia for men, then screen better. \n\nPlus, while blackmail isn\u2019t fun, it is not literally life threatening....It is against the law and all one must do is have their lawyer contact said blackmailer. Simple as that. Sexual assault, Rape and murder are heinous felonies and it\u2019s a crime that is MUCH more serious, in which one can never really recover from and difficult to have a lawyer deal with, once it has already happened (sexual trauma and being scammed can be preventable and why would any gentleman deny a lady knowing his real name? A clever person will figure it out eventually, anyway). \n\nHow many posts of girls on this forum alone, lately, who are scared to report the predators that assaulted them because it was an SB relationship or they feel it will be viewed as prostitution with the police, if they report....  \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, many sugar daddy websites have become increasingly inundated with predators. A savvy woman who is good with screening and can spot a genuine SD would not need any screening apps because he is going to offer up his name (I\u2019ve always had this happen with a genuine SD) compared to a new girl who is going this alone and doesn\u2019t have much life experience. I advise against such a girl using the sugar websites, anyways,but if she is intent, then at least it\u2019s good if she can screen out bad, scamming or dangerous men. This would mean knowing their real name of course.",

Sure, it's unlikely an SD is going to be physically assaulted, but for the sake of the other people in their life that they're responsible for, who aren't consenting parties of an arrangement (i.e. wife, kids, employees), please be smart about your screening process and how you protect yourselves.\n\nI may not have a popular opinion as an SB, but I don't mind if a man doesn't want to reveal his name to me until we've met for coffee. I just don't go anywhere alone with him until I have that information and have verified it.\n\nOddly, I respect that he's being safe and protecting himself and his loved ones from the few unsavory SBs that are just out there to scam men (yes, men get blackmailed).\n\nI've met several wonderful, genuine SDs who weren't married or parents, but had a conservative job or were famous and didn't want to give out a lot of personal information to people they hadn't met. I totally understand this and actually inform them if I was able to find their personal information they may not want to be disclosed.\n\nMost men are just naive and oblivious to how risky it is to us as women to be giving out such personal information, or meeting someone we don't know. Once I've had a chance to explain to them I am not just protecting myself, but my kids, no one has ever pushed me to give out my real name, number, or address.",

That\u2019s so sketch.\n\nIf blackmail is such a paranoia for men, then screen better. \n\nPlus, while blackmail isn\u2019t fun, it is not literally life threatening....It is against the law and all one must do is have their lawyer contact said blackmailer. Simple as that. Sexual assault, Rape and murder are heinous felonies and it\u2019s a crime that is MUCH more serious, in which one can never really recover from and difficult to have a lawyer deal with, once it has already happened (sexual trauma and being scammed can be preventable and why would any gentleman deny a lady knowing his real name? A clever person will figure it out eventually, anyway). \n\nHow many posts of girls on this forum alone, lately, who are scared to report the predators that assaulted them because it was an SB relationship or they feel it will be viewed as prostitution with the police, if they report....  \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, many sugar daddy websites have become increasingly inundated with predators. A savvy woman who is good with screening and can spot a genuine SD would not need any screening apps because he is going to offer up his name (I\u2019ve always had this happen with a genuine SD) compared to a new girl who is going this alone and doesn\u2019t have much life experience. I advise against such a girl using the sugar websites, anyways,but if she is intent, then at least it\u2019s good if she can screen out bad, scamming or dangerous men. This would mean knowing their real name of course.",

Also, any real SD is going to give you his real name and phone number, once a little trust is established because a good guy wants you to feel comfortable and safe...or you can figure out who he is pretty quickly with hints about his company or what he does, then look up his business, company(ies), Bloomberg, news articles, ect. as he will have an online presence.",

That\u2019s so sketch.\n\nIf blackmail is such a paranoia for men, then screen better. \n\nPlus, while blackmail isn\u2019t fun, it is not literally life threatening....It is against the law and all one must do is have their lawyer contact said blackmailer. Simple as that. Sexual assault, Rape and murder are heinous felonies and it\u2019s a crime that is MUCH more serious, in which one can never really recover from and difficult to have a lawyer deal with, once it has already happened (sexual trauma and being scammed can be preventable and why would any gentleman deny a lady knowing his real name? A clever person will figure it out eventually, anyway). \n\nHow many posts of girls on this forum alone, lately, who are scared to report the predators that assaulted them because it was an SB relationship or they feel it will be viewed as prostitution with the police, if they report....  \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, many sugar daddy websites have become increasingly inundated with predators. A savvy woman who is good with screening and can spot a genuine SD would not need any screening apps because he is going to offer up his name (I\u2019ve always had this happen with a genuine SD) compared to a new girl who is going this alone and doesn\u2019t have much life experience. I advise against such a girl using the sugar websites, anyways,but if she is intent, then at least it\u2019s good if she can screen out bad, scamming or dangerous men. This would mean knowing their real name of course.",

Simple as that. Sexual assault, Rape and murder are heinous felonies and it\u2019s a crime that is MUCH more serious, in which one can never really recover from and difficult to have a lawyer deal with, once it has already happened (sexual trauma and being scammed can be preventable and why would any gentleman deny a lady knowing his real name? A clever person will figure it out eventually, anyway). \n\nHow many posts of girls on this forum alone, lately, who are scared to report the predators that assaulted them because it was an SB relationship or they feel it will be viewed as prostitution with the police, if they report....  \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, many sugar daddy websites have become increasingly inundated with predators. A savvy woman who is good with screening and can spot a genuine SD would not need any screening apps because he is going to offer up his name (I\u2019ve always had this happen with a genuine SD) compared to a new girl who is going this alone and doesn\u2019t have much life experience.

Simple as that. Sexual assault, Rape and murder are heinous felonies and it\u2019s a crime that is MUCH more serious, in which one can never really recover from and difficult to have a lawyer deal with, once it has already happened (sexual trauma and being scammed can be preventable and why would any gentleman deny a lady knowing his real name? A clever person will figure it out eventually, anyway). \n\nHow many posts of girls on this forum alone, lately, who are scared to report the predators that assaulted them because it was an SB relationship or they feel it will be viewed as prostitution with the police, if they report....  \n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, many sugar daddy websites have become increasingly inundated with predators. A savvy woman who is good with screening and can spot a genuine SD would not need any screening apps because he is going to offer up his name (I\u2019ve always had this happen with a genuine SD) compared to a new girl who is going this alone and doesn\u2019t have much life experience. I advise against such a girl using the sugar websites, anyways,but if she is intent, then at least it\u2019s good if she can screen out bad, scamming or dangerous men. This would mean knowing their real name of course.",
