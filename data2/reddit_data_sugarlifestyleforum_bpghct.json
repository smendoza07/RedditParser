The problem with the approach to being asked out is that you may agree to meeting, then they'll ghost you if they are not attracted to you once they see your photos.\n\nI see elsewhere you have said you have face/body photos public. If you feel they adequately give SDs an overview of what you look like, then I would remove the private photos entirely and send them privately once you have chatted some more. Many SDs think you might be hiding something in the private photos if you already have accurate public photos, or maybe they think they will see something more racy.",

Besides, it makes no sense to have full face pics public and body pic private, if you're worried about discretion, it should be the other way around. The message hiding your body pics sends is that you're trying to hide your body. And considering how important that is for SDs, I honestly can't blame them for wanting to at least have some idea if they're intersted before putting effort in. Easy to fix though - just make at least one good body shot public.",

If you can't handle a SD who thinks they can take advantage of you, then you shouldn't be in the bowl anyway because those guys are always going to exist and find you regardless if they have to wait to see that you're small.

Besides, it makes no sense to have full face pics public and body pic private, if you're worried about discretion, it should be the other way around. The message hiding your body pics sends is that you're trying to hide your body. And considering how important that is for SDs, I honestly can't blame them for wanting to at least have some idea if they're intersted before putting effort in. Easy to fix though - just make at least one good body shot public.",

If you can't handle a SD who thinks they can take advantage of you, then you shouldn't be in the bowl anyway because those guys are always going to exist and find you regardless if they have to wait to see that you're small. And if you're just worried about being fetishized, then you'll just have to be careful about screening (works for the physical danger concern too).",

Besides, it makes no sense to have full face pics public and body pic private, if you're worried about discretion, it should be the other way around. The message hiding your body pics sends is that you're trying to hide your body. And considering how important that is for SDs, I honestly can't blame them for wanting to at least have some idea if they're intersted before putting effort in. Easy to fix though - just make at least one good body shot public.",

If you can't handle a SD who thinks they can take advantage of you, then you shouldn't be in the bowl anyway because those guys are always going to exist and find you regardless if they have to wait to see that you're small. And if you're just worried about being fetishized, then you'll just have to be careful about screening (works for the physical danger concern too).",

If you can't handle a SD who thinks they can take advantage of you, then you shouldn't be in the bowl anyway because those guys are always going to exist and find you regardless if they have to wait to see that you're small. And if you're just worried about being fetishized, then you'll just have to be careful about screening (works for the physical danger concern too).",

If you can't handle a SD who thinks they can take advantage of you, then you shouldn't be in the bowl anyway because those guys are always going to exist and find you regardless if they have to wait to see that you're small. And if you're just worried about being fetishized, then you'll just have to be careful about screening (works for the physical danger concern too).",
