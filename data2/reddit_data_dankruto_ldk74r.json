            "body": "It seems you don't get it; Rin and Kakashi had a choice. Obito was gonna die anyways and they chose to let him pass as cruelly as possible. The blood loss alone could have taken hours to kill him. Or he might have survived for days to die slowly due to thirst and starvation. An enemy shinobi could have found him and tortured for information. Meanwhile the other option was to give Obito a clean and peaceful death side by side with his teammates.\n\nThere is nothing sympathetic about Rin and Kakashi here, both were cruel bastards to Obito.",

They were surrounded by enemies and behind enemy lines so helping Obito out would've slowed them down and gotten them all killed. If Obito wanted a death by his teammates, he could've asked for it. Can't blame Kakashi and Rin for that.",
