    "body": "I like to talk to lots of potentials, gather intel, share ideas, keep my options open.  New SB just signed up for Seeking.  First she wants to meet same day although we have barely spoken, suggesting she is a pro except she is wanting platonic?  Second the wants me to pick her up at her job suggesting she is hopelessly clueless about safety.  Next she wants me to come to her place for our m&g suggesting she actually planning to harvest my kidney?  \n\nNext she mentions she just graduated high school, lost her license and has no proof of age suggesting I may be Jeff Epstein's cell mate pretty soon if I'm not careful.  And for the coup de grace she blurts out that her boyfriend is in prison by way of explaining I won't need to worry about him being around suggesting angry-boyfriend-retaliation is a great risk once he is released and discovers who has been spooning his girlfriend.\n\nI've only been at this since 2016 but this one is a record of some kind.",
