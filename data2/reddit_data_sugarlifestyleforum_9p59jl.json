    "body": "After many months of flakes and attempted scammers and and catfish and letdowns, today I had the most amazing meet ever.  \n\nShe\u2019s an easy 9.5, way out of my league physically.  I couldn\u2019t contain myself and asked her for intimacy right after the meet and greet.  She was very trusting and followed my lead.  Amazing in bed.  Body was incredible.  She\u2019s everything I\u2019m looking for and more.\n\nDamn.  All the hell in the bowl was SO worth it today.  Yeah I\u2019m a bit smitten.  I voluntarily provided extra ppm just because she blew me away in every way.  \n\nThank you to the SBs who are real and put in effort and make us feel special.  I hope all of you get spoiled as much as I\u2019m going to spoil this girl.",

I just am always curious when people say a woman is gorgeous but not a 10 if they are just leaving room for a potential future hotter person, or are less attracted to her than someone else, or if it\u2019s truly like \u201cshe\u2019d be a ten if her nose were just a little straighter\u201d.
