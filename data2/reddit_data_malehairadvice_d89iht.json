It's not perfectly trimmed and the rest is not perfectly shaven, i know, I will do a wet shave tomorrow i think, but I think if i shave the stubble/goatee completely it will look not so great :(",

Goatees are super out of style, at least where I'm from in the Midwest of America. You could always grow more of a short/stubbley beard. In the end, if you like the goatee, rock that shit.",

It's not exactly like the cut on the picture but i'm still happy that i don't look like a sloth anymore. Paid 12\u20ac (=13.20$) for the cut. There's actually no product in my hair right now. If people are actually interested, I can upload a few more angles. I'm now eagerly waiting for it to grow out a bit. Let's see if my \"real\" curls show up again in a month.

It looks to me to be 1 guard lever open up to a 2 then( maybe a 4)would use 3 personally) or scissors for the top  and sides. Your haircut isnt bad but he went to high with clipper work it will grow out well but im almost positive he brought the fade too high in the back also. Try asking for ac1 2 mid fade and scissor work and see where it gets you. Thanks for posting",
