This is a massively popular and common style that is done by literally millions of guys every day. I don't understand how this sub is so fucking shit all the time.\n\nOk so to start picking apart the mess of these comments DO NOT USE POMADE.\n\nThis requires a matte clay 100%. Nothing else. These dumbfucks will recommend pomade for literally everything and it's very much not applicable. For this amount of height you need a strong hold, matte clay.\n\nBlowdrying your hair is important as well. Back when I had this cut (In like 2012, don't judge me too much ok it was less blase back then) I would turn my head upsidedown (basically between my legs) and blowdry upwards, it helps to get that volume/height and makes it last a lot longer throughout the day as well.\n\nHairspray can help but isn't needed, and will make it look a bit worse, it's just to help you at first to get stuff to hold perfectly. After a few weeks of doing this style every day you can do it every morning in like 2-3 minutes with just a clay and your fingers.\n\nYou will need straight hair for this to work. A bit of wave can give you a very similar style as well (and a better one imo, but different) but anything beyond a very slight wave and this won't be possible unless you want to straighten your hair.",

It's pretty easy if you already have a day of product buildup.\n\nTowel dry your hair, throw an egg-sized amount of mousse in your hair. Look for mousses that advertise a strong hold. \n\nBlow dry your hair back and whichever direction your hair grows in. (So, if your hair grows the right, blowdry it back and two the right. Get everything totally dry.\n\nEmulsify the clay in your hands, and get it in your hair. Start from the back and work your way forward.\n\nThen, style as needed. It will take loads of practice, but it's totally possible. \n\nKeep in mind, the front looks great, but the left side is going to look pretty weird and underwhelming.",

Blow dry on hot up and back, going against your hair\u2019s natural grain. Once completely dry, use a nickel size amount of a good clay (I highly recommended Claymation by Hanz de Fuko) and completely emulsify into your hands and work it fully throughout your hair, pushing your hair forward, then back across that forward push so the front rests against that back hair which is helping prop it up, keeping the volume throughout the day. Finally, lock in that volume by using a boost powder like American Crew\u2019s. Good luck and Godspeed. ",

Agreed that hairspray isn\u2019t necessary but it can help hold it all together (I use it on days where my hair won\u2019t keep its shit together).\n\nI\u2019ll definitely have to try out a pre-styler in the future. I\u2019ve tried clays and they don\u2019t work as well with the texture of my hair - I feel they\u2019re better for people with really, really thick hair but I could have just grabbed one that wasn\u2019t a fit.",
