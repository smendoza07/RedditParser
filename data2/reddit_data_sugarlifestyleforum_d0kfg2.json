    "body": "Let me start by saying, I genuinely like older men a lot, so whenever a man on SA tries to use the fact that he's not some \"gross old man\" as a selling point, I roll my eyes. That's exactly what this kid did (yes, I'm gonna call him a kid, I'm three years older than him, lol), but, he was a sweetheart nonetheless. Sweet enough for me to overlook the fact that *he* overlooked my \"no vegans\" policy stated in my profile. He's a vegan. This comes up later.\n\nI'm on an extended vacation, so I updated my SA location to where I'm visiting, thinking maybe I could find a part time daddy there, since I get back pretty often. The kid messaged me pretty much immediately.\n\nI'll skip the conversation but it was mostly him reassuring me he really is a sugar daddy and really had an SB before. We made plans to get drinks and maybe a light meal. He told me he was vegan and I immediately wanted to cancel, but, luckily, there was a great place I was dying to try with options.\n\nWe're seated and he tells me he's had a headache all day so he won't be drinking....and he already ate so he won't be eating...but he'll buy me whatever I want. Sure. The server comes over and suggests a couple things. One of the things that stands out to me is meat based. He stops me and says \"I won't pay for any meat.\" ...Ok. I decide on burrata.\n\nOur conversation was fun (and the burrata was delicious). He's a cool guy, sweet. He invites me back to his place to watch a movie. I decide why not. Nothing happens, I fell asleep mid-movie on the couch. He paid me for my Uber(s) and I went on my way.\n\nWe text later and he tells me how he \"wishes we could've done more.\" I decide to bring up allowances then. We decide on a number, and he offers to not only pay for my return ticket home but also pay for any future visits to Chicago but practically begged me to stay with him in his not-very-impressive apartment. Whatever. He's cool, and he agreed to the number, that can be approached later.\n\nSo we set up a second date, get drinks (this time he actually has a drink), and go back to his again. We watch a movie and he gets quite handsy, even pulling my boob out of my top to attempt to suckle me like a baby. I stop him and ask nicely about the agreed upon allowance. He deflects, I get completely annoyed, and end up falling asleep mid-movie again.\n\nIn the morning, he finally gets to my allowance. But, he hasn't gotten paid yet. So he only has half of what is a TOTALLY reasonable amount to have in your account if you're allegedly a sugar daddy. He gives me half, and we make out a bit. I also remind him of my ticket, which he's using credits to pay for so it doesn't actually cost him much. I decide to just go with it and....\n\nHe can't even get it up.\n\nI'm just gonna stick to the 50+ crowd.\n\nNo tl;dr, you'll live.",

I went on a date with the foreign guy I have been flakey towards. he is a true blue SD who giggles about his exes and insists on taking me to dinner, who gave me allowance upfront and when I began to speak about it looked into my eyes and told me 'I get it'.This guy was worth it.\n\nHE IS 23! But more mature than a man much older than him. What he isn't is : physically similar to me, and a westerner! I'd say one can try a younger SD if he is from a culture which supports traditional arrangements./relationships\n\nNot here to undermine OP, just to provide clauses for this post.",
