So take everything with a grain of salt and remember that there are extenuating circumstances that may affect what you yourself may expect to receive or give.\n\nPick your region and post your city or general area in this format. \n\n**Example: SB (28) Paris 700-1K weekly, includes overnights and gifts. no travel, indoor only.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* This is not a discussion thread no comments about what other people receive or give is allowed. Simply post your own info. \n\n* No rating of your sugar partners (i.e $500 for a 9 or  for old SD)\n\n* No breakdowns by hourly or sexual acts required for allowance. \n\n* Please note whether allowance is PPM, Monthly, Weekly,etc\n\n* Click reply under the green MOD  comment with the region/country you wish to contribute to and not other replies in that region.

They're also very sweet about offering to cover car, medical, and pet bills as needed.\n\nThough I haven't had an arrangement including intercourse, offers proposed after the M&G have ranged from 600-2000 PPM (2400-10k per month). The higher of which sometimes would have included overnights.\n\nHope this helps!",

Sometimes down to 250\u20ac if only play (no dinner, encounter limited to one hour) included.  Not a real SB, of course, but included for reference. Many SA profiles are escorts.\n* PPM: ranging from 150\u20ac to 250\u20ac, depending on maturity, knowledge, and looks of SB.\n* Monthly allowance: what I've found most often are SBs needing help to pay college tuition.  Bear in mind that college in Spain (even in a private university) is substantially cheaper than in the US or UK! In the cases I dealt with it was in the range 4000\u20ac-6000\u20ac per year.  That boils down to a 600\u20ac allowance per month. I had one case in which she exactly asked for that, no more, no less.  But intimacy was not satisfactory for me, so we did not last long.\n* \\[Added on mid 2022\\] 800\u20ac monthly allowance seems to be an acceptable figure for many SBs in Madrid. \n* I had one case where there was no fixed allowance, but I helped buying clothes, accessories, helping with dental care, contributing to tuition... It is difficult to estimate how much it would have been in the long run.\n\nOf course, in all these cases there may the the occasional gift, dinners and/or lunches, transportation if needed, and hotel rooms.

Sometimes down to 250\u20ac if only play (no dinner, encounter limited to one hour) included.  Not a real SB, of course, but included for reference. Many SA profiles are escorts.\n* PPM: ranging from 150\u20ac to 250\u20ac, depending on maturity, knowledge, and looks of SB.\n* Monthly allowance: what I've found most often are SBs needing help to pay college tuition.  Bear in mind that college in Spain (even in a private university) is substantially cheaper than in the US or UK! In the cases I dealt with it was in the range 4000\u20ac-6000\u20ac per year.  That boils down to a 600\u20ac allowance per month. I had one case in which she exactly asked for that, no more, no less.  But intimacy was not satisfactory for me, so we did not last long.\n* \\[Added on mid 2022\\] 800\u20ac monthly allowance seems to be an acceptable figure for many SBs in Madrid. \n* I had one case where there was no fixed allowance, but I helped buying clothes, accessories, helping with dental care, contributing to tuition... It is difficult to estimate how much it would have been in the long run.\n\nOf course, in all these cases there may the the occasional gift, dinners and/or lunches, transportation if needed, and hotel rooms.  Hope this helps!",
