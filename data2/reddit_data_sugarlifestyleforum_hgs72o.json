    "body": "I posted awhile back in preparation for my first overnight with my amazing SD of six months. \n\nHe booked a stay in an extra special location just outside of town. He picked me up in the morning and we drove into the mountains. \n\nWe went hiking and checked out some viewpoints. (I enjoyed being one of the cute couples cuddling while looking at the viewpoint. Sd and I are cautious about PDA when we go on dates in town. We didnt have to worry about that here.)\n\nTook a trip to the grocery store for supplies. (This was fun to experience together. It was one big scavenger hunt as neither of us were familiar with the store layout.) \n\nWe checked into the hotel and made it to our room. OMG this hotel room! It was ground level room with a sliding glass door out to the patio. The gas fireplace was also a nice addition and looked gorgeous in the roo. On the patio was a gas firepit next to a table and chairs. The landscaping was gorgeous along with the view.\n\n I recently learned how to play chess, so we played a game outside on the patio while wrapped in fuzzy bath robes and spa slippers. He always remembers to bring a bottle of our favorite wine. We sipped and played chess. \n\nWhiskey anyone? I'm no whiskey connoisseur, Jack Daniels gets the job done just fine. SD wanted to treat me a fancier whiskey, higher proof.  We disagreed on the greatness of this particular whiskey and it was a fun lighthearted debate as I took shots anyway, quickly chasing with Dr. Pepper (not Coke). Isn't Coke best for whiskey lol?\n\nThe two person tub and spacious bathroom were oh so inviting. The lighting in the hotel room made it possible to have dim accent lights in each room. He ran a bath for us, and that's where we existed for the next hour. We cuddled, we touched, we kissed, we tried not to fall asleep, we played. \n\nThe intimacy was next level. We're quite comfortable with each other at this point, no improvements needed. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night so we spent a little time together at 3 AM. I watched him fall back asleep as I watched Hulu on my phone. \n\nI could go on forever. It was amazing. I feel so valued and cared for.\n\nTLDR;;;\nSD took me to a mountain get away for our first overnight. It was perfect, and I cant pick just one favorite part.\n\nFavorite parts: Roadtriping, waking up in middle of night, two person baths, and not watching the clock, not worrying about discretion while out of town.",

And then debated what the best soft drink is to chase whiskey with.  A tear or two, then I bucked up like a brave cowboy and went on.\n\n\ud83e\udd23  Anyway, sounds amazing, congrats!",

It's pretty hard to beat Evan Williams Single Barrel for quality per dollar in my opinion (bottle in the low $30s that is pretty good), but I'm assuming OP is talking about a single malt scotch, or a nice Japanese whisky, or something like that, and I have never had a bad one of those.",
