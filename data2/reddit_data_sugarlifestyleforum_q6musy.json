    "body": "The most important part of any arrangement is your safety. The amount of violence toward women is horrific. We all know the stats. Sadly, the sugar world is no different, and potentially worse.\n\nThere is a lot of great advice in this forum to help you stay safe. Read it, take your time, be careful, trust your instincts.\n\nBut I also recommend having a personal alarm (I give these to my SB's). It's a safe way to attract attention and stop an attack in many situations (including a hotel room). If you are a SB and you aren't carrying some sort of personal protection please consider picking up something like this:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Self-Defense-Siren-Keychain-Emergency/dp/B08CCCB58N/?\\_encoding=UTF8&pd\\_rd\\_w=Dhp6h&pf\\_rd\\_p=ed0a22d3-02a9-43b9-a7a8-2632c9eb2ad8&pf\\_rd\\_r=5Y4WKYDDQXJ2EXF0JPPD&pd\\_rd\\_r=124d6f2c-de1d-462f-acac-e286e1e1f9b2&pd\\_rd\\_wg=328AK&ref\\_=pd\\_gw\\_ci\\_mcx\\_mr\\_hp\\_atf\\_m&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Defense-Siren-Keychain-Emergency/dp/B08CCCB58N/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=Dhp6h&pf_rd_p=ed0a22d3-02a9-43b9-a7a8-2632c9eb2ad8&pf_rd_r=5Y4WKYDDQXJ2EXF0JPPD&pd_rd_r=124d6f2c-de1d-462f-acac-e286e1e1f9b2&pd_rd_wg=328AK&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&th=1)\n\nIf bills are super tight and you can't find an extra $20, DM me and I will buy it for you. If you don't want to share your address with a strange avocado then setup an amazon wishlist with your address marked private and I will order, pay for it and have it sent to you without having to see anything about you (delivering to a nearby Amazon Lockbox is also valid).\n\nStay safe.\n\n**10/12/21 update:** I've gone through all my DM's and ordered alarms for everyone that requested one. They are on their way. Please let me know if I missed you, I got a lot of requests (and a lot of sweet personal messages). The offer is still open for anyone who needs it.\n\n**10/13/21 update:** I've gone through all my DM's and ordered alarms for everyone that requested one. As above, please let me know if I missed anyone. Hopefully this coming weekend is a little safer for everyone.\n\n**10/14/21 update:** Alarms have gone out to everyone that requested one. The first people should be receiving their alarms today. Today will be the last day to contact me to get an alarm.\n\n**10/15/21 update:** The offer is over. Alarms have been sent around the world. If you have already requested one and we are waiting for you to setup a wishlist or add your address I'll still send it when you are ready. Thank you to everyone who posted their words of encouragement and advice here to help keep SB's safe. Operation 'TA protects the T&A' was a success.",

In the pre computer days Police Departments often used his questionnaire to evaluate the probability of domestic violence through asking the potential victim 20 questions.   Sadly the LAPD officers responding to OJ Simpson's wife's complaints never did this as he would have scored a perfect 20/20  where something like 14/20 was considered a very significant risk.  \n\ndeBecker has made a computerized version of the questionnaire, modified for different situations, available on the internet .   Recently I had the wife of someone suffering from combat related PTSD run the analysis while I ran it from just what I knew to be fact.  We both came up with a very troubling answer and similar results that have motivated us to become much more proactive.",

Its goal was to create an easy to learn series of self defense techniques that cover the most common situations. \n\n Where female students are involved the emphasis is on deterring a larger, stronger opponent by focusing on vulnerabilities sufficient to break contact or discourage further intent, using women's greater flexibility, superior ability to follow instructions and sharp nails. \n\nThe goal is not to defeat the threat in hand to hand combat but rather to prevent his gaining control, cause damage/pain ,  break contact and escape. \n\nOne other thought that deBecker emphasizes that is relevant to M&G situations is the danger of getting into or being forced into a car by someone who intends to abuse you justifies the use of virtually any means of escape. \n\n.",

Most certainly a very unique and interesting assignment!  Protection of just one person as opposed to being a member of \"The Force\" as a large group of military people doing what we were asked/ordered/expected by the American People to do...I make a higher income now, but there is no question in my mind those years wearing a \"tree suit\" were the most personally professionally rewarding of my life!! The friendships both with those I served with and people of other cultures and countries was so satisfying! I don't like young women (or any human for that matter) to have to have a constant feeling of apprehension/fear but it is wise to be forward thinking and assess one's personal tolerance for safety risk. This I would believe could be a wise choice!",

Its goal was to create an easy to learn series of self defense techniques that cover the most common situations. \n\n Where female students are involved the emphasis is on deterring a larger, stronger opponent by focusing on vulnerabilities sufficient to break contact or discourage further intent, using women's greater flexibility, superior ability to follow instructions and sharp nails. \n\nThe goal is not to defeat the threat in hand to hand combat but rather to prevent his gaining control, cause damage/pain ,  break contact and escape. \n\nOne other thought that deBecker emphasizes that is relevant to M&G situations is the danger of getting into or being forced into a car by someone who intends to abuse you justifies the use of virtually any means of escape. \n\n.",
