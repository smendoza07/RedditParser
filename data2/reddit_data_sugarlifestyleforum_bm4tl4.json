    "body": "Had a m&g the other day and she did not look like her picture.  The picture she sent me looked just a little filtered, didn't seem that drastic until I met her in person.  Probably a pic from her late teens or early twenties in hindsight. She looked at least few years older and she had smoker teeth.\n\nI send the most casual pic I have of myself. No filters, no touch ups, and no special angles. it's just me standing in front a gallery. Very casual. I'm not even in a suit.\n\nPlease ladies and gents, use photos that are honest and recent. Some filtering is expected but if anyone shows up looking different then it's deal breaker.",

If you send photos of you looking like a 10 and you are less than that, even if you are a super attractive 6 or 7, you have just made yourself LESS desirable by setting expectations way too high.  \n\n\nI prefer to send pictures of me that are cute but nothing amazing. That way when I show up, the comment is ALWAYS \"Wow! I knew you were attractive but you look AMAZING in person\".  \n\n\nLadies, under promise and over deliver and you can never go wrong.",

The nervous behavior and desire to punch out is palpable.

I still wouldn't over sell myself and once I get to know a potential SD I do send morning selfies with no makeup to test the waters with them. Normally no one minds but I have gotten the occasional \"you look exhausted\" type messages.
