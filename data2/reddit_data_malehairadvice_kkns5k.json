To get this specific style is more along the lines of genetics for example my brother can grow a goatee really quickly and effortlessly, It\u2019s a pain in the ass for me to grow a mustache but I can grow out mutton chops as quickly as he can grow his goatee. When I grew out my beard I learned that I have to stop putting pressure on me and my beard to look like this persons or that style because my beard was a different beard then I have ever seen before, I had a big round beard that focused more on thickness and being bushy rather then length and how long it could grow out.",
