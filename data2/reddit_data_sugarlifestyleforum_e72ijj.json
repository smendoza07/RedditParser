The main reason why I like him so much is that I thought he is the most chill and sweet person I\u2019ve ever met. But the things he said to her were childish insults, rants how she is not attractive enough compared to the girls he is taking to atm! I\u2019m feeling sick just reading that",

After a few months, I could tell she was researching this topic and approached me very amicably (so much so that I wonder if she's posted and received advice on here, haha).  Nonetheless, I like her a lot, so happily agreed to her request.  It was very high, nearly double!  But she's beautiful, young and sexy so I do not mind at all.  I just can't see her as often, but it's okay as I savor those days anyways.\n\nI only say this to suggest that you may want to do the same.  And if he acts childish to you as he did to your friend, I highly suggest you move on.  You can find someone that will adore and cherish you.  Though I hate to admit, that it's a LOT harder now with so many false expectations of findom, platonic relationships, frauds, salt daddies, etc...\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hopefully this sour experience can turn into lemonade!!!",

Who else is he messaging and offering more money. You do develop some kind of feelings I'm not denying that. SD don't belong to anyone. Unless they say they are exclusively seeing you. That wasn't the deal obviously cause he was messaging other SB's. I think she may have been more upset he offered her friend more money. But these are my opinions from my own experience. Just like that was yours.",
