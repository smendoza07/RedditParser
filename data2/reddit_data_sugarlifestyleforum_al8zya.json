    "body": "So I got scammed.. this man that claimed he was a doctor said he would give me a weekly allowance. We met up, hit it off, and started our arrangement. He immediately said he didn\u2019t do cash only green dot cards. I thought it was weird and got a bad feeling but since he showed me his work ID and was always dressed in scrubs, I was like fine. We had sex and then he gave me the card.. as soon as I left when I went to go activate the card, it showed invalid!!! He blocked me off sa and I\u2019ve called him a bunch of times but no luck. I\u2019m so embarrassed and feel used and dirty for being so naive. I\u2019m going through such a rough time right now, that\u2019s what made me decide to give SA a shot. This was just the cherry on top.",

I figured if it worked out, then things would be great, and if not then no skin off my back. So I thought.  \n\n\nHe fucked me for two months. The Friday before \"payday,\" (\\~$5000) he ghosted entirely. I felt so naive and stupid, and didn't realize how much that would actually affect me. I figured he would just keep putting off paying me, I honestly didn't think he would disappear. I don't think I've ever felt more dumb and used. But...I feel like maybe I needed this lesson. It's hard when you're a nice person and people take advantage of it. But I let my anger from this situation fuel me to be stronger when dealing with these assholes.

He said it was a business expense act so it takes a day to go through. Well- I had a bad feeling and so I called PayPal and they told me that wasn\u2019t even a real account. I feel exactly like you right now super ashamed and feeling terrible. I have been crying. I hope you are okay and we\u2019ll get though this. ",

Anyone who is upset with an SD for any reason could post or lie about them for any reason. Even worse, blackmailers could threaten an SD with making a post. The forum, the mods and the website could be liable.  There have been other similar sites shutdown for this reason. \n\nDo what you are doing now. Report hin to SA and share how you got scammed so other may learn from your experience.",

We need eachother to learn, even sometimes it's a tough lesson. Accept it happened, this stops your mind to create any negative thoughts towards him and you and move on. Breathe deep again.

One of the things that helped reduce the rate of accidents very significantly was rigorous investigations of the causes and changes in training, procedures , equipment and rules.  \n\nOver the past two decades technology has given pilots far more information on their position, course guidance, weather etc.  But airplanes still crash and an increasingly alarming percentage of the accidents occur when they are so fixated on a few instruments that they ignore reality..... American Airlines coined the term \" Children of the Magenta\"  as the desired course is displayed as a magenta line on the instruments. The opening presentation is on youtube.   Often the folly of their actions would have been obvious had they just looked out the window or recognized other signals.  \n\nDeBecker talks a lot about detecting signals that things are not as you would like them to be and acting decisively. Left of Bang takes it further, looking for subtle indicators that signal risk. \n\nI think one of the most valuable contributions here is for those who have some experience is  to share with others the danger signals they may have missed prior to an unhappy  sugar crash. \n",

I get that for some people it does kind of ruin the \u201cmoment\u201d but girls having sex and then feeling deceived happens far too often for men to take it personally.  It leaves women feeling turned off by this type of relationship and takes potentially great SBs out of the bowl.  \n\nThe biggest con artists are absolutely charming and the type to put in effort to make you feel like trusting them. IMO, best is to provide up front at the beginning of the date so it\u2019s out of the way and not looming in her mind ",

The forum, the mods and the website could be liable.  There have been other similar sites shutdown for this reason. \n\nDo what you are doing now.

One of the things that helped reduce the rate of accidents very significantly was rigorous investigations of the causes and changes in training, procedures , equipment and rules.  \n\nOver the past two decades technology has given pilots far more information on their position, course guidance, weather etc.  But airplanes still crash and an increasingly alarming percentage of the accidents occur when they are so fixated on a few instruments that they ignore reality..... American Airlines coined the term \" Children of the Magenta\"  as the desired course is displayed as a magenta line on the instruments. The opening presentation is on youtube.   Often the folly of their actions would have been obvious had they just looked out the window or recognized other signals.  \n\nDeBecker talks a lot about detecting signals that things are not as you would like them to be and acting decisively. Left of Bang takes it further, looking for subtle indicators that signal risk. \n\nI think one of the most valuable contributions here is for those who have some experience is  to share with others the danger signals they may have missed prior to an unhappy  sugar crash. \n",

If I have sex with a SB and find out later she had a boyfriend, and I would not have had sex with her, was I raped?

One of the things that helped reduce the rate of accidents very significantly was rigorous investigations of the causes and changes in training, procedures , equipment and rules.  \n\nOver the past two decades technology has given pilots far more information on their position, course guidance, weather etc.  But airplanes still crash and an increasingly alarming percentage of the accidents occur when they are so fixated on a few instruments that they ignore reality..... American Airlines coined the term \" Children of the Magenta\"  as the desired course is displayed as a magenta line on the instruments. The opening presentation is on youtube.   Often the folly of their actions would have been obvious had they just looked out the window or recognized other signals.  \n\nDeBecker talks a lot about detecting signals that things are not as you would like them to be and acting decisively. Left of Bang takes it further, looking for subtle indicators that signal risk. \n\nI think one of the most valuable contributions here is for those who have some experience is  to share with others the danger signals they may have missed prior to an unhappy  sugar crash. \n",
