    "body": "\nTL;DR at the end\nI\u2019m also texting this while on the subway so excuse all of the grammatical errors and the length.\n\nI made an earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/f7uh29/i_figured_out_what_to_get_the_sd_who_has/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about surprising my SD for his birthday. \nThis community had a LOT of opinions, with the general consensus saying I shouldn\u2019t go through with it. \n\nI went with my gut and did it anyway. \n\nNothing went as planned. \n\nMy SD decided to leave work early in order to get ready for our date, even though his secretary had blocked out the surprise time on his schedule and disguised it as a meeting with the head of HR (who was also in on it). \n\nHis secretary started frantically texting me that she had tried to keep him at the office but that he had gone [rogue](https://imgur.com/a/bMZKTVt) and canceled the HR meeting. \nI tried texting him to go back to his office. \nIt didn\u2019t [work](https://imgur.com/a/CrFG5Kl)\ud83d\ude44\n\nI had to quickly think on my feet. I had pre-arranged for us to have the mezcal bar to ourselves for an hour.\nI asked the GM if I could bring the mariachi band there, he agreed.\n\nThen I had to tell my SD there was a change in [plans](https://imgur.com/a/VHU8ajB)\u2014the whole time he thought I was coming over at 5:30 to go for an early dinner. \n\nAnyway, when my SD walked in he was totally caught off guard. The band started [playing](https://imgur.com/a/Nx4ThRq), the mezcal started flowing. It was amazing.\n\nHe absolutely lovedddd it. His response was, \u201cWell now I have to get Rihanna for your birthday\u201d. \n\nAfter the band had gone I told him about my original plan to have the mariachi band play at his office. \n\nHis response was, \u201cWait so you were going to send a mariachi band up to my office, and wait at the restaurant to surprise me? I would have wanted you to come up too\u201d.\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cI felt like that would have been a LOT, to show up at your office alongside the band.\u201d \n\nAnd he was like, \u201cThe whole idea is A LOT. But if you\u2019re going to do it then go all out\u201d.\n\nYou have NO idea how happy that made me. Literally the sweetest exchange ever. \ud83d\ude0d\nHe also thought it was so smart of me to reach out to his secretary and HR. He said and I quote, \u201cYeah, that was the perfect person to reach out to. She has worked for me for a long time and deals with all my bullshit\u201d. \n\nAnyway, then we got wasted and ran around the city and went to one of those [peep](https://imgur.com/a/qaLRae7) shows in time square. You know, where you\u2019re in a little room and you put in the token and the curtain goes up. His first time, my fourth. And then we went the to champagne room of our favorite Upper East Side strip club; Sapphire. \n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have a text conversation discussing the office surprise. But I do have [this](https://imgur.com/a/Df5SQNx), evidence that we talked about it after the fact. As you can see he is un-phased. \nI also have this text [convo](https://imgur.com/a/FD1auWG) where I ask him about getting a gift to thank the members of his staff who helped plan the day. \n\nAll in all I would say it was an ahhhmazing birthday surprise! \n\nI want thank this community. Even though people had varying opinions I know it was all out of love. \nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, it doesn\u2019t matter how you sugar as long as it\u2019s sweet! \n\nTL;DR: Things didn\u2019t go as planned but the surprise was a success! I also got validation that not only would he have loved the mariachi at his office, but he would have wanted me to be there as well!\n\nEdit: Thank you to /u/mraspencer and anonymous for the rewards. Super dope!",

Obviously I don\u2019t share everything, it\u2019s still light and fun, but I genuinely enjoy his company as well as his generosity. \n\nI\u2019ve been lucky enough to where most of my sugar relationships (past the age of 22) have looked like this. \n\nHowever I know the game. I always make sure to look my absolute best. I am always trying to introduce new things in the bedroom. I cook, but I\u2019ll never clean. I surprise him and make him laugh. I\u2019m up to date on financial news as well as politics. Wealthy men have access to some of the hottest women in the world, especially in nyc. In order to stay afloat I have to set myself apart.",
