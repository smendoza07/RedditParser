The difference between them is Naruto has far more chakra to put in.

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

The Chibaku Tensei sphere thing has no durability feats so for all we know it\u2019s just the Achilles heal of the jutsu and can be broken with a kunai or something (probably not a kunai but you get my point).

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

Sasuke literally just cannot use that ability, and it works different from normal Chibaku Tensei (normal Chibaku creates a black hole, True Chibaku makes the target the center of the pull). \n\nJust because they aren\u2019t using giant mountain sized balls for attacks doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not strong, they focus their attacks to not completely destroy the planet since everyone involved wants something that destroying the planet would prevent them from getting (Naruto and Sasuke want to live there, the Otsutsuki want the chakra).",

The elder son inherited the eyes of the So6P, which was the sharingan. The uchiha\u2019s are primed to develop the rinnegan.\n\nAlso mind you, Sasuke took well to the Mangekyo at 16? Within a year or two he has the Rinnegan. The entirety of shippuden was 2 years in universe. 16 is not too old for a ninja prodigy who specializes in eye techniques to learn a more advanced ocular style. If anything Sasuke should have been the one to fully harness the power of the rinnegan, since it\u2019s more natural for him than Nagato, he spent years with it in his prime unlike Madara, and he *is* that ninja prodigy.\n\nMadara makes more sense but still\u2026 He\u2019s the most prodigious ninja ever after Hashi, Naruto, and Sasuke. He\u2019s the one that brought it back in the first place. He was already more OP in base form than Pain was (might be controversial but I can\u2019t see Pain beating perfect Susanoo).\n\nThe series isn\u2019t going to waste a bunch of time with endless training, but to rise to the top in real life there is a grind involving a whole lot of practice and training. They showed snippets of the characters training and you get the idea.\n\nI don\u2019t have much of a problem with the main series depiction of power usage. I didn\u2019t like how  ridiculous the power creep became by the end, as well as the Otsusuki bs, but that\u2019s not really the powers themselves. Boruto is when they start disrespecting their own legacy.",

As long as a black rod is in your target, you can control them and you don\u2019t need rods yourself, you can just control said person regardless. The ones in Nagato were just never taken out. \n\nIt\u2019s never stated the actual range of the chakra transmission with the black rods, but the wiki says \u201c the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation,\u201d which is why Pain originally had his Yahiko Pain get closer to him before he used Chibaku Tensei",

Hagoromo doesn't even let Naruto and Sasuke think they can beat her. Their win condition is to touch her at the same time, which when you think about it is really telling. I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

Madara has the ten tails, who has 100x times more chakra power than Kurama and natural energy. Kurama said it himself that he is much weaker than the ten tails.\n\nMomoshiki and Kinshiki were getting betean up by the 4 kages and Naruto and Sasuke in base forms xd.\n\nFused Momoshiki was killed by Boruto :)))\n\nMadara couldn't be killed even when he had 1 rinnegan only. Hagoromo gave Naruto and Sasuke the seals because he knew Madara couldnt die and the seals were for him and not for Kaguya since Hagoromo didn.t know she would revive.\n\nTo say that weak Otsutsuki is stronger than Kaguya or Madara is a really dumb statement. Just because Naruto and Sasuke grew up doesn't mean Naruto's Kurama got more chakra then what he had 15 years ago.\n\nKurama is just a part of the ten tails, he is not equal to him.\n\nIdk man I feel like some people can't understand what they see with their eyes.",

Someone mentioned Urashiki but if I remember correctly, he is a filler character.\n\nA better post would be that all EMS users eventually ended up unlocking Rinnegan.",

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

The elder son inherited the eyes of the So6P, which was the sharingan. The uchiha\u2019s are primed to develop the rinnegan.\n\nAlso mind you, Sasuke took well to the Mangekyo at 16? Within a year or two he has the Rinnegan. The entirety of shippuden was 2 years in universe. 16 is not too old for a ninja prodigy who specializes in eye techniques to learn a more advanced ocular style. If anything Sasuke should have been the one to fully harness the power of the rinnegan, since it\u2019s more natural for him than Nagato, he spent years with it in his prime unlike Madara, and he *is* that ninja prodigy.\n\nMadara makes more sense but still\u2026 He\u2019s the most prodigious ninja ever after Hashi, Naruto, and Sasuke. He\u2019s the one that brought it back in the first place. He was already more OP in base form than Pain was (might be controversial but I can\u2019t see Pain beating perfect Susanoo).\n\nThe series isn\u2019t going to waste a bunch of time with endless training, but to rise to the top in real life there is a grind involving a whole lot of practice and training. They showed snippets of the characters training and you get the idea.\n\nI don\u2019t have much of a problem with the main series depiction of power usage. I didn\u2019t like how  ridiculous the power creep became by the end, as well as the Otsusuki bs, but that\u2019s not really the powers themselves. Boruto is when they start disrespecting their own legacy.",

As long as a black rod is in your target, you can control them and you don\u2019t need rods yourself, you can just control said person regardless. The ones in Nagato were just never taken out. \n\nIt\u2019s never stated the actual range of the chakra transmission with the black rods, but the wiki says \u201c the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation,\u201d which is why Pain originally had his Yahiko Pain get closer to him before he used Chibaku Tensei",

Hagoromo doesn't even let Naruto and Sasuke think they can beat her. Their win condition is to touch her at the same time, which when you think about it is really telling. I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

Madara has the ten tails, who has 100x times more chakra power than Kurama and natural energy. Kurama said it himself that he is much weaker than the ten tails.\n\nMomoshiki and Kinshiki were getting betean up by the 4 kages and Naruto and Sasuke in base forms xd.\n\nFused Momoshiki was killed by Boruto :)))\n\nMadara couldn't be killed even when he had 1 rinnegan only. Hagoromo gave Naruto and Sasuke the seals because he knew Madara couldnt die and the seals were for him and not for Kaguya since Hagoromo didn.t know she would revive.\n\nTo say that weak Otsutsuki is stronger than Kaguya or Madara is a really dumb statement. Just because Naruto and Sasuke grew up doesn't mean Naruto's Kurama got more chakra then what he had 15 years ago.\n\nKurama is just a part of the ten tails, he is not equal to him.\n\nIdk man I feel like some people can't understand what they see with their eyes.",

Especially when in 6paths DMS form Kakashi took Kamui to hax level max, increasing its power and incorporating it into basically everything (Kamui shuriken, raikiri, etc). And we know he's a position to use it as well because 6paths chakra boosted his speed to kaguya level\n\nHeck, the only reason Obito was stopped in the war was because the shinobi forces had Kakahi on their side, with his own Kamui\n\nI still think it's the most busted Jutsu to this day, and I'm not sure there's been any counter to it thus far (please correct me if I'm wrong though, I'm not up to date on Boruto)",

The difference between them is Naruto has far more chakra to put in.

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

Sasuke literally just cannot use that ability, and it works different from normal Chibaku Tensei (normal Chibaku creates a black hole, True Chibaku makes the target the center of the pull). \n\nJust because they aren\u2019t using giant mountain sized balls for attacks doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not strong, they focus their attacks to not completely destroy the planet since everyone involved wants something that destroying the planet would prevent them from getting (Naruto and Sasuke want to live there, the Otsutsuki want the chakra).",

The elder son inherited the eyes of the So6P, which was the sharingan. The uchiha\u2019s are primed to develop the rinnegan.\n\nAlso mind you, Sasuke took well to the Mangekyo at 16? Within a year or two he has the Rinnegan. The entirety of shippuden was 2 years in universe. 16 is not too old for a ninja prodigy who specializes in eye techniques to learn a more advanced ocular style. If anything Sasuke should have been the one to fully harness the power of the rinnegan, since it\u2019s more natural for him than Nagato, he spent years with it in his prime unlike Madara, and he *is* that ninja prodigy.\n\nMadara makes more sense but still\u2026 He\u2019s the most prodigious ninja ever after Hashi, Naruto, and Sasuke. He\u2019s the one that brought it back in the first place. He was already more OP in base form than Pain was (might be controversial but I can\u2019t see Pain beating perfect Susanoo).\n\nThe series isn\u2019t going to waste a bunch of time with endless training, but to rise to the top in real life there is a grind involving a whole lot of practice and training. They showed snippets of the characters training and you get the idea.\n\nI don\u2019t have much of a problem with the main series depiction of power usage. I didn\u2019t like how  ridiculous the power creep became by the end, as well as the Otsusuki bs, but that\u2019s not really the powers themselves.

As long as a black rod is in your target, you can control them and you don\u2019t need rods yourself, you can just control said person regardless. The ones in Nagato were just never taken out. \n\nIt\u2019s never stated the actual range of the chakra transmission with the black rods, but the wiki says \u201c the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation,\u201d which is why Pain originally had his Yahiko Pain get closer to him before he used Chibaku Tensei",

I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

Madara has the ten tails, who has 100x times more chakra power than Kurama and natural energy. Kurama said it himself that he is much weaker than the ten tails.\n\nMomoshiki and Kinshiki were getting betean up by the 4 kages and Naruto and Sasuke in base forms xd.\n\nFused Momoshiki was killed by Boruto :)))\n\nMadara couldn't be killed even when he had 1 rinnegan only. Hagoromo gave Naruto and Sasuke the seals because he knew Madara couldnt die and the seals were for him and not for Kaguya since Hagoromo didn.t know she would revive.\n\nTo say that weak Otsutsuki is stronger than Kaguya or Madara is a really dumb statement. Just because Naruto and Sasuke grew up doesn't mean Naruto's Kurama got more chakra then what he had 15 years ago.\n\nKurama is just a part of the ten tails, he is not equal to him.\n\nIdk man I feel like some people can't understand what they see with their eyes.",

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

The elder son inherited the eyes of the So6P, which was the sharingan. The uchiha\u2019s are primed to develop the rinnegan.\n\nAlso mind you, Sasuke took well to the Mangekyo at 16? Within a year or two he has the Rinnegan. The entirety of shippuden was 2 years in universe. 16 is not too old for a ninja prodigy who specializes in eye techniques to learn a more advanced ocular style. If anything Sasuke should have been the one to fully harness the power of the rinnegan, since it\u2019s more natural for him than Nagato, he spent years with it in his prime unlike Madara, and he *is* that ninja prodigy.\n\nMadara makes more sense but still\u2026 He\u2019s the most prodigious ninja ever after Hashi, Naruto, and Sasuke. He\u2019s the one that brought it back in the first place. He was already more OP in base form than Pain was (might be controversial but I can\u2019t see Pain beating perfect Susanoo).\n\nThe series isn\u2019t going to waste a bunch of time with endless training, but to rise to the top in real life there is a grind involving a whole lot of practice and training. They showed snippets of the characters training and you get the idea.\n\nI don\u2019t have much of a problem with the main series depiction of power usage. I didn\u2019t like how  ridiculous the power creep became by the end, as well as the Otsusuki bs, but that\u2019s not really the powers themselves. Boruto is when they start disrespecting their own legacy.",

Hagoromo doesn't even let Naruto and Sasuke think they can beat her. Their win condition is to touch her at the same time, which when you think about it is really telling. I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

Madara has the ten tails, who has 100x times more chakra power than Kurama and natural energy. Kurama said it himself that he is much weaker than the ten tails.\n\nMomoshiki and Kinshiki were getting betean up by the 4 kages and Naruto and Sasuke in base forms xd.\n\nFused Momoshiki was killed by Boruto :)))\n\nMadara couldn't be killed even when he had 1 rinnegan only. Hagoromo gave Naruto and Sasuke the seals because he knew Madara couldnt die and the seals were for him and not for Kaguya since Hagoromo didn.t know she would revive.\n\nTo say that weak Otsutsuki is stronger than Kaguya or Madara is a really dumb statement. Just because Naruto and Sasuke grew up doesn't mean Naruto's Kurama got more chakra then what he had 15 years ago.\n\nKurama is just a part of the ten tails, he is not equal to him.\n\nIdk man I feel like some people can't understand what they see with their eyes.",

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

Sasuke literally just cannot use that ability, and it works different from normal Chibaku Tensei (normal Chibaku creates a black hole, True Chibaku makes the target the center of the pull). \n\nJust because they aren\u2019t using giant mountain sized balls for attacks doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not strong, they focus their attacks to not completely destroy the planet since everyone involved wants something that destroying the planet would prevent them from getting (Naruto and Sasuke want to live there, the Otsutsuki want the chakra).",

I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

                            "body": "Simple reason why Rinnegan abilities scale with chakra is because, as you said, six tails Naruto could break out of Nagato\u2019s Chibaku Tensei, but the full half of the nine tails got captured by Sasuke instantly along with the other 8 bijou so they are on different levels already. Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

Hagoromo doesn't even let Naruto and Sasuke think they can beat her. Their win condition is to touch her at the same time, which when you think about it is really telling. I think we as a fanbase have kind of underestimated her for a long time because of how late she came in, Sakura punching her in the blind spot, bring defeated her first appearance, etc. So I think I can see Kaguya fatally wounding Isshiki when he's not expecting it while they're both fruitless.\n\nAlso, the acknowledgement that the Ten Tails, the biggest power up/monster of the original series, was just a mass produced Ohsutsuki seed should have also been a tell for me in hindsight. Also the fact that Kaguya was so strong despite not having eaten a ripe chakra fruit. She only ate it after it had soaked up the blood from countless wars, but people were still around.",

Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

The Chibaku Tensei sphere thing has no durability feats so for all we know it\u2019s just the Achilles heal of the jutsu and can be broken with a kunai or something (probably not a kunai but you get my point).

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

            "body": "Simple reason why Rinnegan abilities scale with chakra is because, as you said, six tails Naruto could break out of Nagato\u2019s Chibaku Tensei, but the full half of the nine tails got captured by Sasuke instantly along with the other 8 bijou so they are on different levels already. Now if you look at six tails Naruto compared to the Deva path, the Deva path couldn\u2019t do anything to Naruto and didn\u2019t get any hits off from what I remember (tbf I watched the anime so idk if the manga is different) but Naruto got some hits in so was substantially faster, neither of them really got hurt but that was cause of Deva path hax, so I would say six tails Naruto is reasonably above the Deva path, but not by an insane degree. Now this version of Naruto didn\u2019t break out of the Chibaku tensei with ease, but burst half of its body out then pulled itself out iirc, plus it\u2019s strength outclassed the Deva path by a ton and it was only able to stay safe with hax. This means it\u2019s fair to assume IMO that it should be able to hold people around relative to the user especially since those weren\u2019t Pain\u2019s eyes and also Hagoromo and his brother who were relative to Kaguya since they fought her for a long time managed to seal her away for centuries or whatever.\n\nTl;dr Rinnegan scales to power cause Sasuke sealed more powerful entities than Nagato failed to and based on Nagato vs six tails Naruto and Kaguya vs Hagoromo and his brother you can seal people relative you but they might need to be weakened first like a pokeball otherwise sealing is op.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

For example, Rinnegan Sasuke has more chakra than Nagato has more chakra than Tendo Pain. So my argument is rhat they can expend more into it, and Sasuke who has the most human levels of chakra relative to power of the three can\u2019t do that as effectively, especially as we get into opponents like Momoshiki, Jigen, and Isshiki who have relative or greater chakra levels to him. It would simply be too much chakra wasted on a jutsu that is highly counterable (Momo could just destroy his Chibaku Tensei or resist his Shinra Tensei) compared to his more rounded jutsu like literal teleportation, a lightning blade that has extremely high cutting power and AP, and his kenjutsu that is so good it could while he was weakened match Kinshiki casually, Kinshiki being stated as able to split worlds with a swing of his weapon.\n\nTL;DR - even if the Six Paths abilities scale in power with the user, it\u2019s unlikely they would scale to such an extent that they are particularly valuable against opponents with abilities and strength levels that could overpower or break the attacks.",

The Chibaku Tensei sphere thing has no durability feats so for all we know it\u2019s just the Achilles heal of the jutsu and can be broken with a kunai or something (probably not a kunai but you get my point).

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

Sasuke literally just cannot use that ability, and it works different from normal Chibaku Tensei (normal Chibaku creates a black hole, True Chibaku makes the target the center of the pull). \n\nJust because they aren\u2019t using giant mountain sized balls for attacks doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not strong, they focus their attacks to not completely destroy the planet since everyone involved wants something that destroying the planet would prevent them from getting (Naruto and Sasuke want to live there, the Otsutsuki want the chakra).",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

Rasengan allowed Konohamaru to take out a path of pain and 8th gate took Guy who\u2019s base is around P1 Kakashi level to being able to take on Juubi Madara. That\u2019s just 2 examples.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",

My point with Nagato vs Bee was that Naruto was using a Rasenshuriken, the most powerful wind style jutsu we\u2019ve seen, and Bee was using a bijou bomb, which speaks for itself. So my point wasn\u2019t that the core can\u2019t be broken, but that that\u2019s showing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really weak. I was joking about sharingan and Rinnegan being busted but my point was that as Itachi said in that fight, all jutsu have a weakness, as to what you brought up, the eight gate kills the user, and the rasengan has to hit the opponent who can just keep their distance since it is close range and unlike Chidori doesn\u2019t give speed buff.",
