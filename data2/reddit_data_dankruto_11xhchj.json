But Dosu has to actually get close to her to do his thing, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, and to the best of our knowledge he has no particular formidable defense. Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",

                                    "body": "Consider it from this perspective: Had Shikamaru won, he would've had to fight Shino. Had he beat Shino, he would've had to fight either Naruto or Gaara (Sasuke was late, and only managed to stay in the fight based on Orochimaru convincing Hiruzen to keep him in).\n\nShikamaru knew this (not the stuff with Sasuke). He knew he'd have to fight Shino, and Naruto or Gaara.\n\nThis *context* is important, because it means his line about being low on chakra doesn't necessarily mean \"if this fight continues, I will run out of chakra, then lose.\" It very well could mean \"I could continue this fight for a while longer, but I might not have enough chakra for the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nHe did not need to win *to win*. The tournament isn't about who the best fighter is. It's about showing off your new toys to the world, and showing off whether someone would make a capable chunin.\n\nShikamaru did not lose. He forfeited. He could've won had he wanted to, but that would mean he'd be up against his next opponent. If he goes up against another fighter, he might not have enough chakra to make a good showing, which would ruin the previous fight retroactively. Him forfeiting means Temari won the battle but lost the war. *Everyone* now knows that Temari only won because Shikamaru decided to forfeit, and then she'd be forced to fight against Shino.\n\nAlso, Tamari, Kankuro, and Gaara are not jonin level shinobi. They're *chunin* at the most. Gaara's only point in his favour is that he's got a nuke inside him, but he does *not* have the skill for jonin at that time.\n\nEDIT: The way Shikamaru losing the next fight would hurt his previous fight, is due to it sending some very specific messages to the audience. First off: he's a good strategist, but he needs to learn his limits. Or, perhaps, Shikamaru had a month to prepare against Temari, maybe part of his failure was not being able to think on the fly? Or his loss would just erase his previous fight in some eyes.",

But Dosu has to actually get close to her to do his thing, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, and to the best of our knowledge he has no particular formidable defense. Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",

                            "body": "Consider it from this perspective: Had Shikamaru won, he would've had to fight Shino. Had he beat Shino, he would've had to fight either Naruto or Gaara (Sasuke was late, and only managed to stay in the fight based on Orochimaru convincing Hiruzen to keep him in).\n\nShikamaru knew this (not the stuff with Sasuke). He knew he'd have to fight Shino, and Naruto or Gaara.\n\nThis *context* is important, because it means his line about being low on chakra doesn't necessarily mean \"if this fight continues, I will run out of chakra, then lose.\" It very well could mean \"I could continue this fight for a while longer, but I might not have enough chakra for the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nHe did not need to win *to win*. The tournament isn't about who the best fighter is. It's about showing off your new toys to the world, and showing off whether someone would make a capable chunin.\n\nShikamaru did not lose. He forfeited. He could've won had he wanted to, but that would mean he'd be up against his next opponent. If he goes up against another fighter, he might not have enough chakra to make a good showing, which would ruin the previous fight retroactively. Him forfeiting means Temari won the battle but lost the war. *Everyone* now knows that Temari only won because Shikamaru decided to forfeit, and then she'd be forced to fight against Shino.\n\nAlso, Tamari, Kankuro, and Gaara are not jonin level shinobi. They're *chunin* at the most. Gaara's only point in his favour is that he's got a nuke inside him, but he does *not* have the skill for jonin at that time.\n\nEDIT: The way Shikamaru losing the next fight would hurt his previous fight, is due to it sending some very specific messages to the audience. First off: he's a good strategist, but he needs to learn his limits. Or, perhaps, Shikamaru had a month to prepare against Temari, maybe part of his failure was not being able to think on the fly? Or his loss would just erase his previous fight in some eyes.",

But Dosu has to actually get close to her to do his thing, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, and to the best of our knowledge he has no particular formidable defense. Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",

Had he beat Shino, he would've had to fight either Naruto or Gaara (Sasuke was late, and only managed to stay in the fight based on Orochimaru convincing Hiruzen to keep him in).\n\nShikamaru knew this (not the stuff with Sasuke). He knew he'd have to fight Shino, and Naruto or Gaara.\n\nThis *context* is important, because it means his line about being low on chakra doesn't necessarily mean \"if this fight continues, I will run out of chakra, then lose.\" It very well could mean \"I could continue this fight for a while longer, but I might not have enough chakra for the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nHe did not need to win *to win*. The tournament isn't about who the best fighter is. It's about showing off your new toys to the world, and showing off whether someone would make a capable chunin.\n\nShikamaru did not lose. He forfeited. He could've won had he wanted to, but that would mean he'd be up against his next opponent. If he goes up against another fighter, he might not have enough chakra to make a good showing, which would ruin the previous fight retroactively. Him forfeiting means Temari won the battle but lost the war. *Everyone* now knows that Temari only won because Shikamaru decided to forfeit, and then she'd be forced to fight against Shino.\n\nAlso, Tamari, Kankuro, and Gaara are not jonin level shinobi. They're *chunin* at the most. Gaara's only point in his favour is that he's got a nuke inside him, but he does *not* have the skill for jonin at that time.\n\nEDIT: The way Shikamaru losing the next fight would hurt his previous fight, is due to it sending some very specific messages to the audience. First off: he's a good strategist, but he needs to learn his limits. Or, perhaps, Shikamaru had a month to prepare against Temari, maybe part of his failure was not being able to think on the fly? Or his loss would just erase his previous fight in some eyes.",

But Dosu has to actually get close to her to do his thing, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, and to the best of our knowledge he has no particular formidable defense. Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",

Had he beat Shino, he would've had to fight either Naruto or Gaara (Sasuke was late, and only managed to stay in the fight based on Orochimaru convincing Hiruzen to keep him in).\n\nShikamaru knew this (not the stuff with Sasuke). He knew he'd have to fight Shino, and Naruto or Gaara.\n\nThis *context* is important, because it means his line about being low on chakra doesn't necessarily mean \"if this fight continues, I will run out of chakra, then lose.\" It very well could mean \"I could continue this fight for a while longer, but I might not have enough chakra for the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nHe did not need to win *to win*. The tournament isn't about who the best fighter is. It's about showing off your new toys to the world, and showing off whether someone would make a capable chunin.\n\nShikamaru did not lose. He forfeited. He could've won had he wanted to, but that would mean he'd be up against his next opponent. If he goes up against another fighter, he might not have enough chakra to make a good showing, which would ruin the previous fight retroactively. Him forfeiting means Temari won the battle but lost the war. *Everyone* now knows that Temari only won because Shikamaru decided to forfeit, and then she'd be forced to fight against Shino.\n\nAlso, Tamari, Kankuro, and Gaara are not jonin level shinobi. They're *chunin* at the most. Gaara's only point in his favour is that he's got a nuke inside him, but he does *not* have the skill for jonin at that time.\n\nEDIT: The way Shikamaru losing the next fight would hurt his previous fight, is due to it sending some very specific messages to the audience. First off: he's a good strategist, but he needs to learn his limits. Or, perhaps, Shikamaru had a month to prepare against Temari, maybe part of his failure was not being able to think on the fly? Or his loss would just erase his previous fight in some eyes.",

Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",

But Dosu has to actually get close to her to do his thing, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, and to the best of our knowledge he has no particular formidable defense. Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",

But Dosu has to actually get close to her to do his thing, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, and to the best of our knowledge he has no particular formidable defense. Nothing to negate a weapon barrage, at least. Kin has a good chance of winning but that depends on how Tenten reacts to her needles. Does she deflect them? Dodge wide instead of just barely cocking her head to the side like Shikamaru? It\u2019s definitely not a guaranteed loss, and theoretically Kin could have defeated anyone (except Gaara probably) at the Exams if they reacted the wrong way against her Jutsu.\n\nKiba is actually debatable, because how long can he do fang over fang? His chakra and stamina isn\u2019t unlimited, so even if it can deflect every type of weapon, which isn\u2019t a guarantee, it\u2019s a limited defensive option. If Tenten plays keep away until he burns himself out she\u2019ll have him dead to rights (theoretically she could do this to Neji too, but it\u2019s dependent on the ability to maintain distance).\n\nEither way, against all of those guys except Zaku, I maintain that her odds of winning are good to great.",
