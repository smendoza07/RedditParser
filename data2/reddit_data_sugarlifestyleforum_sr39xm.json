    "body": "So i have to go through literally hundreds of profiles with no pictures, politely asking to see something, anything. 99% of which, once I see them, are sooo terrible, it\u2019s like homeless people. It gets extremely tiring to have to ask one by one. \n\nAll of these men, (most with very average jobs, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s Elon Musk \u2026) no photos because, discretion, because of my job\u201d I get it, if you are the Prince of Persia. And even then you can find an anon photo.\n\nI mean, do you think I want to put all my photos out there, and have no discretion? I am also a person that deserves a bit of privacy and respect and who has a job.\n\nI get that it\u2019s pure capitalist offer/demand but I really think it would make the process flow so much better for everyone if men were required to have photos, even if the face was pixelated etc. because otherwise, girls like me who are not pros, frankly don\u2019t have several hours a day to message random men for photos. Escorts do.",

It is looked down as a site for lonely losers or an escort site. \n\nAdd to that 80% of men are married and many are business leaders or society figures in some capacity or other vs say a 22 yo SB who is underemployed and has little to lose.

(Mainly because my search sometimes includes curvy and I don\u2019t want to redo my message filters)\n\nWill you miss out on some legit SDs? Yes. Will your experience on the site be more pleasant? Probably.\n\nMy profile is hidden in search/etc, and has never/will never have any pics. I expect that I\u2019m missing out on SBs who have their profiles hidden and SBs who require pics on the site to engage. I\u2019m ok with that because when I search, there are still hundreds of women who fit my tight search criteria.\n\nAnd I hide for career/discretion risk. Medicine is still a very conservative field. Otherwise, I\u2019m divorced/single.\n\nSo basically, if someone wants my pics, she\u2019ll find them on a vanilla dating site. If they want sugar, they\u2019ll have to accept that I\u2018ll only share pics by text. And even then, lightly anonymized ones. I\u2019m paranoid from a career risk standpoint. \n\nAlas, I haven\u2019t bothered with SA in almost 2yrs. Apparently showing pics and tweaking my vanilla profiles was all I needed to do to start getting a reasonable flow of matches.",

All more or less align with the advice handed out here to the women who seek a profile review... show your face, smile, no filters, show your figure, show an activity you're involved in,  etc. \n\nWho would possibly care if they see me on Seeking?\nMy boss? \"Yeah boss, I am. So how's your search going?\" \nMy neighbor maybe? \"Yeah buddy I am. How's your luck been?\"\nA coworker perhaps? \"Sure enough man, I think it's fun. How you doing there?\"\n\nAny guy who would confront me for being on Seeking would literally have had to be on Seeking himself. So perhaps the bigger question... why are these dudes searching Sugar Daddy profiles? That's just effing weird.\n\nAny women friends, neighbors, coworkers, supervisors, family members etc would also have to explain their own presence on Seeking. How would they rationalize their presence while demonizing me?\n\nMaybe if I were a politician, or Fortune 500 CEO or just some dude cheating on his wife? I guess? But the same holds true I think. Anyone who would discover and confront a guy in those situations still has to explain their own presence on Seeking.\n\nThe real truth is likely that the vast majority of dudes who don't post pictures are bald, fat, ugly, gross or some combination thereof, and know that they couldn't pass the initial profile picture scrutiny. I'm clearly no Clooney, (more of a Hanks) but I'm pretty well preserved for a dude my age (so I've been told). But better yet I have nothing to hide or be ashamed of.",

You think the majority of people are paying over a hundred bucks are curious? That seems massively unlikely. \n\nAlso if you're talking about the free accounts, those can be made for SD and SB alike, neither of which require payment.

Divorce is one of the worst things a person can go through and still be physically whole, statistically speaking, for one's financial, physical, and mental health. Being called a whore is a nasty insult, which doesn't hit me particularly hard, but maybe you feel it more. Either way, it's not comparable to a divorce. A divorce is more comparable to getting audited or dragged through a strenuous court trial. And that's *before* you get into what can happen if you didn't have a prenup.",

That seems massively unlikely. \n\nAlso if you're talking about the free accounts, those can be made for SD and SB alike, neither of which require payment. But the difference is that unpaid SD accounts can not message anyone, all they can do is send picture requests. \n\nIts also easy to filter out any non premium accounts as a SB by simply paying yourself too.",
