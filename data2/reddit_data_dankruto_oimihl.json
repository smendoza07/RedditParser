I'm going to base my thoughts on the anime, since I didn't read the manga.\n\nTobirama knew what would cause an Uchiha to awake Sharingan - if not extremely strong emotions, then trauma. When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

I'm going to base my thoughts on the anime, since I didn't read the manga.\n\nTobirama knew what would cause an Uchiha to awake Sharingan - if not extremely strong emotions, then trauma. When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

I'm going to base my thoughts on the anime, since I didn't read the manga.\n\nTobirama knew what would cause an Uchiha to awake Sharingan - if not extremely strong emotions, then trauma. When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

Also, put a fail-safe mechanism in naruto so he wouldn't go on a rampage and put kushina's chakra to motivate him when he needed it.

I'm going to base my thoughts on the anime, since I didn't read the manga.\n\nTobirama knew what would cause an Uchiha to awake Sharingan - if not extremely strong emotions, then trauma. When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

I'm going to base my thoughts on the anime, since I didn't read the manga.\n\nTobirama knew what would cause an Uchiha to awake Sharingan - if not extremely strong emotions, then trauma. When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

I'm going to base my thoughts on the anime, since I didn't read the manga.\n\nTobirama knew what would cause an Uchiha to awake Sharingan - if not extremely strong emotions, then trauma. When he saw that Sasuke had awaken Mangekyou Sharingan, there was no hatred nor disdain on his face, rather concern. And although he did make some comments and yelled at Sasuke (which was understandable, given Sasuke's idea of destroying Konoha), he showed no signs of triumph nor even content about the Uchiha having been murdered. He later talked to Sasuke in a more composed manner and even pleaded with Madara to not harm the boy (you know, when Madara turned Madara Junior into a selfie stick).\n\nSasuke and Tobirama had to cooperate to fight the Ten Tails too. \n\nAlso, bonus for \"shonen protagonist resting face\".",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",

Hashirama literally created the concept of the village and made it happen, borderline cruel to use his accomplishments against his literal lesser, but that's not bad on us, makes it hard to use seriously though.\n\nMy main nit pick is that if you're going to start a list, you might as well include the subject. You could've even taken the moment to be like \n\nMinato: kills large pest and double suicides over his kid.\n\nI only got involved and shittily so because, while I disagree, you have a lot you could say to at least give yourself some ground. I think you're right that Minato did less than say Hash or Hir, but what about Tobirama? Like honestly, 0 wank? He's just mad about clans and writing angry jutsus that become better with time, one of them by Minato.\n\nI guess it just seems sort of tone deaf to me. It's already hard to shit on Minato because everyone doesn't want you to, and the good points for why he's on the bottom half of 6 people are very few and far between. He has way more \"feats\" than \"defeats\" and a lot of the other Hokages have some pretty serious flaws. (Minato is literally a legend. And not in the cool way, as in most of it is speculation, and we just take these things at face value without any real understanding of him as a person or shinobi. He was the fastest, coming to be the strongest, would fight tailed beasts given a chance, knew the best of sealing jutsu without any ties to sealing jutsu. The plot jerks him enough.)\n\nSorry for the book, I just kind of wanted you to know that I'm not just downing on you, I lowkey support you in fact. Yellow flash kisses boys",
