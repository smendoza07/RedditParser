    "body": "Had a date with SD yesterday. He had a full morning of Zoom meetings then took the whole afternoon off to spend the day with me. My plan was to have a private picnic sushi date in the hotel room and spend the rest of the day in bed together. However, when he picked me up he said he was scheduled a last minute Zoom meeting in the middle of our date and he would need to answer it whilst he was in the room with me. I didn't mind. I could amuse myself for 30 minutes.\n\nWhilst on his call, I explored the room being mindful to be super quiet and out of shot (his video was on), so I cleaned up the sushi picnic I had set up for us on the bed and head into the bathroom. I had brought a little sexy black lace lingerie dress to wear for later but what perfect time to be cheeky and walk about in it now, so I got changed and walked out of the bathroom, did a little twirl and fashion show before propping myself up on the bed for him to stare. Ngl I was just trying to be cheeky and sexy. I've never done anything like this before so I was quite nervous and shy but he couldn't take his eyes off me! He was trying so hard to focus. He kept batting his eyes at me and shifting in his seat. It was quite amusing and very cheeky on my part. If I had known better, I would've been more brave. 10 minutes later his call ended and he spent no time wasting getting in bed with me \ud83d\ude02\n\nLater on whilst we were cuddling in bed, he checked his email real quick and showed me that the business call he was on earlier had just secured him a deal worth a mil! He was pretty proud of that and so was I. I'm glad the day went so well for us both. So looking forward to the next time I get to see him again!",

Like a $200k salary sounds like a lot, but in NY and California, taxes are 40-50%.  So the SD only has 100-110k in actual cash.  if their rent is $5k per month, a $2k per month allowance basically means they've spent 75-80% of their cash for the month without even eating!\n\nand a several million dollar deal could translate to no money or a bonus in the tens of thousands.  unless the guy owns the company and has a small business...then he could be raking in quite a bit depending on profit margins and expenditures",
