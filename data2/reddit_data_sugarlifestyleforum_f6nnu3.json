My daughter is a Girl Scout and I help run cookie sales because I have a big sprinter Van limo.  My sugar baby went through my key rack until she found the sprinter key,  stole 3 cases of thin mints and didn\u2019t tell me for 48 hours.  I don\u2019t know if I can trust her anymore.  What does a 106 lb girl do with three cases of thin mints?  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
