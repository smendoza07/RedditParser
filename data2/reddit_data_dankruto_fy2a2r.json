Had it not been for Madara using a Nine-tails powered Susanoo, Hashirama could have easily killed him, before or after the alliance between the Uchiha and Senju. And even with all that, Hashirama won at the end. \n\nWhat caused this vast difference in their strengths? When Ashura and Indra fought, they were equally as strong WITHOUT Indra having the power of a tailed beast, just his raw strength was enough to at least not be killed by Ashura during their fight (Keep in mind this is Ashura after he received his father's, sage of the six paths, powers). So it should only make sense for their reincarnations to be equal henceforth. I guess a writing slip-up?",

Sasuke trained. \n\nHell, all Indras worked harder. \n\nAshura spent his time playing and being an untalented, lazy loser who had powers of a God given to him. \n\nHashirama is not anywhere near as talented. He has enough chakra to keep spamming woodstyle. Madara is a master of all fighting styles. We saw it. He wipes out most of the army with just taijutsu, he kept pulling out new Ninjutus out of his ass, he had best genjutsu in the series, he was expert and kenjutsu and fuijutsu as well. \n\n\nSasuke too, is a better swordsmen, has better Ninjutus Arsenal, he did not spend time on friends. He did not waste his days pranking people. He studied and trained. All day long. \n\nIndra and his reincarnations were more talented and more hard working. Indra was an unparalleled genius but he also spent his entire life training. Ashura did exact opposite. Same held true for Sasuke and Naruto and Madara and Hashirama. \n\nHashirama is the only exception. He had best power handed to him while Madara trained.\n\nNaruto had a nuke put in him when he was a child. Hashirama did not even need to befriend a demon in his belly and Ashura was handed his powers on a silver platter. \n\nBut it's the Uchihas who are naturally gifted and Naruto worked hard. Maybe that's why after three years. Sasuke was Kage level and Naruto was still a loser.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Anyone can learn Flying Thunder God but it doesn't take away from Minato's speed. \n\nSame way, someone else could so what Obito did but Obito still did it. Sasuke broke through Tsukiyomi but couldn't Genjutsu a perfect jinjurichi. Obito did it. \n\nIt's clear Obito is above Itachi. Sasuke took all the tailed beasts in one glance. \n\nKomoatsykami isn't even that strong. Danzo tried and lost. That Samurai guy broke out of it once he realised he was fucked with. \n\nMeaning it's not unbreakable. Neither is Tsukiyomi. Simply having a special genjutsu does not mean you are stronger than someonr with no special ablity. This is because Sasuke with normal sharing about broke through Itachi. \n\nLook, Naruo has a fuck ton of chakra, his mother did as well and she had it as her own. She was dying and still fucked Kurama. \n\nSimply having a pecial ablity does not mean it's useful. Power is ablity to cause change. Sasuke took over all tailed beasts in a glance, Obito took over a perfect jinjurichi. \n\nBoth of these are greater achievements than Itachi. \n\nYes, Chakra and stamina matter a lot. They affect genjutsu abilities. So does skill, experience and intelligence. \n\nThe fact stands, one way or other. Itachi has been outdone over and over again. Itachi relies on Genjutsu far too much, and once he got outdone. He was done for. \n\nOcular Genjutsu is also a genjutsu. Itachi has food eye balls  it not good enough. He has good chakra but not good enough. Good intelligence but not good enough. He  might have had potential but his peak was nothing compared Sasuke, Obito or Madara even in genjutsu department only. \n\nPeople like him. I do. But he has been outdone a thousand times over.",

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

He has enough chakra to keep spamming woodstyle. Madara is a master of all fighting styles. We saw it. He wipes out most of the army with just taijutsu, he kept pulling out new Ninjutus out of his ass, he had best genjutsu in the series, he was expert and kenjutsu and fuijutsu as well. \n\n\nSasuke too, is a better swordsmen, has better Ninjutus Arsenal, he did not spend time on friends. He did not waste his days pranking people. He studied and trained. All day long. \n\nIndra and his reincarnations were more talented and more hard working. Indra was an unparalleled genius but he also spent his entire life training. Ashura did exact opposite. Same held true for Sasuke and Naruto and Madara and Hashirama. \n\nHashirama is the only exception. He had best power handed to him while Madara trained.\n\nNaruto had a nuke put in him when he was a child. Hashirama did not even need to befriend a demon in his belly and Ashura was handed his powers on a silver platter. \n\nBut it's the Uchihas who are naturally gifted and Naruto worked hard.

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Sasuke broke through Tsukiyomi but couldn't Genjutsu a perfect jinjurichi. Obito did it. \n\nIt's clear Obito is above Itachi. Sasuke took all the tailed beasts in one glance. \n\nKomoatsykami isn't even that strong. Danzo tried and lost. That Samurai guy broke out of it once he realised he was fucked with. \n\nMeaning it's not unbreakable. Neither is Tsukiyomi. Simply having a special genjutsu does not mean you are stronger than someonr with no special ablity. This is because Sasuke with normal sharing about broke through Itachi. \n\nLook, Naruo has a fuck ton of chakra, his mother did as well and she had it as her own. She was dying and still fucked Kurama. \n\nSimply having a pecial ablity does not mean it's useful. Power is ablity to cause change. Sasuke took over all tailed beasts in a glance, Obito took over a perfect jinjurichi. \n\nBoth of these are greater achievements than Itachi. \n\nYes, Chakra and stamina matter a lot. They affect genjutsu abilities. So does skill, experience and intelligence. \n\nThe fact stands, one way or other. Itachi has been outdone over and over again. Itachi relies on Genjutsu far too much, and once he got outdone. He was done for. \n\nOcular Genjutsu is also a genjutsu. Itachi has food eye balls  it not good enough. He has good chakra but not good enough. Good intelligence but not good enough. He  might have had potential but his peak was nothing compared Sasuke, Obito or Madara even in genjutsu department only. \n\nPeople like him. I do. But he has been outdone a thousand times over.",

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

They affect genjutsu abilities. So does skill, experience and intelligence. \n\nThe fact stands, one way or other. Itachi has been outdone over and over again.

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Sasuke took over all tailed beasts in a glance, Obito took over a perfect jinjurichi. \n\nBoth of these are greater achievements than Itachi. \n\nYes, Chakra and stamina matter a lot. They affect genjutsu abilities. So does skill, experience and intelligence. \n\nThe fact stands, one way or other. Itachi has been outdone over and over again. Itachi relies on Genjutsu far too much, and once he got outdone. He was done for. \n\nOcular Genjutsu is also a genjutsu. Itachi has food eye balls  it not good enough.

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Anyone can learn Flying Thunder God but it doesn't take away from Minato's speed. \n\nSame way, someone else could so what Obito did but Obito still did it. Sasuke broke through Tsukiyomi but couldn't Genjutsu a perfect jinjurichi. Obito did it. \n\nIt's clear Obito is above Itachi. Sasuke took all the tailed beasts in one glance. \n\nKomoatsykami isn't even that strong. Danzo tried and lost. That Samurai guy broke out of it once he realised he was fucked with. \n\nMeaning it's not unbreakable. Neither is Tsukiyomi. Simply having a special genjutsu does not mean you are stronger than someonr with no special ablity. This is because Sasuke with normal sharing about broke through Itachi. \n\nLook, Naruo has a fuck ton of chakra, his mother did as well and she had it as her own. She was dying and still fucked Kurama. \n\nSimply having a pecial ablity does not mean it's useful. Power is ablity to cause change. Sasuke took over all tailed beasts in a glance, Obito took over a perfect jinjurichi. \n\nBoth of these are greater achievements than Itachi. \n\nYes, Chakra and stamina matter a lot. They affect genjutsu abilities. So does skill, experience and intelligence. \n\nThe fact stands, one way or other. Itachi has been outdone over and over again. Itachi relies on Genjutsu far too much, and once he got outdone. He was done for. \n\nOcular Genjutsu is also a genjutsu. Itachi has food eye balls  it not good enough. He has good chakra but not good enough. Good intelligence but not good enough. He  might have had potential but his peak was nothing compared Sasuke, Obito or Madara even in genjutsu department only. \n\nPeople like him. I do. But he has been outdone a thousand times over.",

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

He did not waste his days pranking people. He studied and trained. All day long. \n\nIndra and his reincarnations were more talented and more hard working. Indra was an unparalleled genius but he also spent his entire life training. Ashura did exact opposite. Same held true for Sasuke and Naruto and Madara and Hashirama. \n\nHashirama is the only exception.

                                                            "body": "Sasuke has weak Genjutsu too. You are confusing genjutsu with their Ocular jutsu. Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Anyone can learn Flying Thunder God but it doesn't take away from Minato's speed. \n\nSame way, someone else could so what Obito did but Obito still did it. Sasuke broke through Tsukiyomi but couldn't Genjutsu a perfect jinjurichi. Obito did it. \n\nIt's clear Obito is above Itachi. Sasuke took all the tailed beasts in one glance. \n\nKomoatsykami isn't even that strong. Danzo tried and lost. That Samurai guy broke out of it once he realised he was fucked with. \n\nMeaning it's not unbreakable. Neither is Tsukiyomi. Simply having a special genjutsu does not mean you are stronger than someonr with no special ablity. This is because Sasuke with normal sharing about broke through Itachi. \n\nLook, Naruo has a fuck ton of chakra, his mother did as well and she had it as her own. She was dying and still fucked Kurama. \n\nSimply having a pecial ablity does not mean it's useful. Power is ablity to cause change. Sasuke took over all tailed beasts in a glance, Obito took over a perfect jinjurichi. \n\nBoth of these are greater achievements than Itachi. \n\nYes, Chakra and stamina matter a lot. They affect genjutsu abilities. So does skill, experience and intelligence. \n\nThe fact stands, one way or other. Itachi has been outdone over and over again. Itachi relies on Genjutsu far too much, and once he got outdone. He was done for. \n\nOcular Genjutsu is also a genjutsu. Itachi has food eye balls  it not good enough. He has good chakra but not good enough. Good intelligence but not good enough. He  might have had potential but his peak was nothing compared Sasuke, Obito or Madara even in genjutsu department only. \n\nPeople like him. I do. But he has been outdone a thousand times over.",

Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Simply having a special genjutsu does not mean you are stronger than someonr with no special ablity. This is because Sasuke with normal sharing about broke through Itachi. \n\nLook, Naruo has a fuck ton of chakra, his mother did as well and she had it as her own.

Itachi relies on Genjutsu far too much, and once he got outdone. He was done for. \n\nOcular Genjutsu is also a genjutsu. Itachi has food eye balls  it not good enough.

                                                                    "body": "Ocular jutsu IS NOT Genjutsu, it is called dojutsu. Dojutsu is a jutsu that pertains to one's eyes, just like the bakugan. Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

                                    "body": "Sasuke has weak Genjutsu too. You are confusing genjutsu with their Ocular jutsu. Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

                            "body": "Sasuke has weak Genjutsu too. You are confusing genjutsu with their Ocular jutsu. Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use. Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

Not only that, but Sasuke is also far less experienced overall in combat, especially with Genjutsu, than everyone else on the list. I could go on, but hopefully you get my point. Speaking objectively while considering all stand points and taking in the fact that Itachi was stated as the strongest all around Genjutsu user in the entire series, I think enough was said to convey my point with as little personal opinion involved as possible.",

            "body": "Sasuke has weak Genjutsu too. You are confusing genjutsu with their Ocular jutsu. Jutsu such as Amateratsu, Sasuke's space-time jutsu, Susano'o, Obito's phasing jutsu, etc. These are not Genjutsu. Shisui has by far the absolute strongest genjutsu in kotoamatsukami. He has it in both eyes, which gives him one use per eye every 10 years. The jutsu can make the victim do anything they want for as long as they want without the user ever knowing they are under it. It can also alter memories and erase them as well. Itachi has Tsukuyomi in one eye and Amaterasu in the other. Tsukuyomi is another broken Genjutsu and Amaterasu is a very strong ocular jutsu. Tsukuyomi traps the victim in an illusionary world in which he can alter the victim's perception of time. It can also be indistinguishable from reality if Itachi chose to make it that way. He could break someone's mind, killing them mentally, thus killing them in real life once he releases the Genjutsu. It's only limitations are the users endurance and chakra. Although he said 72 hours, Itachi was able to manipulate Kakashi in that Genjutsu for an unknown amount of time while he was sick and dying. I say an unknown amount of time due to the multilayered time manipulation. Although it was stated to be 72 hours of time, during the first second of that 72 hours, Kakashi stated that it felt like 1 hour had already passed. So really, we could calculated that, but oh well. Neither Madara nor Obito gained any special Genjutsu from their Sharingan, therefore any Genjutsu they use that is specific to the Sharingan, any Sharingan user can use, such as Izanagi. With that being said, Itachi was stated to be the absolute best and strongest Genjutsu user in the series, excluding Shisui and his Kotoamatsukami specifically. Other than Shisui's genjutsu, which can only be used once every 10 years per eye, Itachi's Tsukuyomi is unparalleled when compared to other Genjutsu that is only usable by the Sharingan that essentially creates it. Genjutsu such as Izanagi and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can be used by anyone who meets the requirements to activate it. Izanagi can be used by nearly anyone at the cost of the eye that used it. Then there's the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It requires a lot to activate it, but can essentially still be used by anyone. So yeah, Obito controlled a perfect Jinchuriki, but any Uchiha with strong enough eyes can do it. Controlling the Jinchuriki is based on the strength of one's Sharingan control and chakra. As we saw with Sasuke, he was able to delve into Naruto's mind and see the ten tails at the beginning of Shippuden. Not comparing the feats, only that the Sharingan was what allowed it, not any Genjutsu. With that said, during the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, Sasuke was able to control all 9 of the tailed beasts. That is a feat that Obito would not have been able to do. During the 4th war, Obito needed the Edo Tensei in combination with the Gedo Statue to control the resurrected Jinchuriki and tailed beasts. So the question remains, is Shisui's kotoamatsukami overall stronger than Itachi's Tsukuyomi? Extremely untouchable Op capability or extremely OP capability + usability?\n So, with that said: Shisui KA >/=/< Itachi Tsukuyomi > Sasuke > Madara > Obito > Sasuke",

Is what Neji and Hinata do a Genjutsu now too? Also, I never said anyone with a special jutsu is automatically more powerful. I simply stated that when we are talking about the strongest Uchiha in the history of the series and their Genjutsu, you have to look at it objectively. First of, as I stated, the Infinite Tsukuyomi is not in play here due to the requirements to use it is basically being an Otsutsuki. The Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi  areby far the strongest Genjutsu on the table. Since they can only be used by Shisui and Itachi respectively, that puts them a step above the rest. Remember, we are talking about who has the strongest Genjutsu, not who has the strongest Sharingan. The Sharingan has a base Genjutsu that comes with it. Simply looking into someone's eyes can place a Genjutsu on them if you choose. This Genjutsu is basic and easy to use. Its level of effectiveness depends on the users chakra levels and chakra control. No matter how strong you are, this basic Genjutsu would never be considered to be on the same playing field as Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi. The only reason why Sasuke was able to \"break\" out of the Tsukuyomi was due to Itachi's rapidly deteriorating health and strength throughout the battle. From a point in which he was already half blind and dying before said fight even began, so using that as an arguing point is weak. It would be extremely difficult for one to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi when he is healthy. Also, you stated that Danzo escaped Kotoamatsukami, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, he had to use one of the Sharingan he had already stolen in order to activate Izanagi. You spoke of Mifune realizing he was in a Genjutsu, which I don't quite remember. However, Danzo is not an Uchiha, therefore he can not use the Sharingan nearly as well as the Uchiha, let alone the original owner of said eyes. Also, don't forget that Itachi was hailed as the greatest Genjutsu user of all time(this is canon). Kotoamatsukami, is the only exception, seeing as how it is by far the strongest Genjutsu. It's only limitation being the recharge time to use it. Kotoamatsukami, Tsukuyomi, and Izanagi are the only Genjutsu that are always guaranteed to affect an Uchiha because of their strength. These same Genjutsu have the same effect against anyone and anything in the show. Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are literally overpowered and broken in their capabilities. Izanagi comes at a huge cost and can be used by any Sharingan and its strength is consistent due to its cost being your eye. So it is a none factor. Basic Genjutsu like what is used by Obito and Sasuke is very strong in need, but it has its limitations. The big difference isn't simply \"special abilities,\" it is the strength of the 2 specific jutsu that pushes Shisui and Itachi leagues above everyone else. In raw power, Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi are leagues ahead of all other Genjutsu the Uchiha can use. In capabilities, they also excel far beyond all others. With that in mind, the 1st and second slot for most powerful individual Genjutsu goes to Shisui and then Itachi respectively. However, what I believe you are referring to is the strongest Genjutsu user, not who has the strongest Genjutsu, which is where the confusion lies. In that case, the order shifts.\nThe order for most powerful Genjutsu goes as such: Shisui > Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara. Although, the order for most powerful Genjutsu USER (meaning all around strength, versatility and prowess with Genjutsu) it goes as such: Itachi > Sasuke > Obito > Madara and then Shisui is in limbo. Shisui only had one real fight in the series, which didn't fully portray his full capabilities with Genjutsu to that degree. He also didn't get to grow and mature like the others. So realistically he is last, but theoretically, had he matured, he would possibly have been far superior to even Itachi. With that being said, none of the Genjutsu that Sasuke, Obito or Madara uses throughout the series would have any effect on Itachi, except for Izanagi. However, Kotoamatsukami is an instant Win for Shisui against any opponent who doesn't have Izanagi prepared as a counter and the only one other than Danzo who truely knew about Kotoamatsukami was Itachi. Which leaves everyone else as a sitting duck. Itachi has Tsukuyomi which could be extremely harmful, if not fatal, to Sasuke, Obito and Madara. Madara is the only one that I think would escape from Tsukuyomi before any permanent damage is dealt. Obito would probably be f**ked with a slight chance for escape. Sasuke is a toss up, he has experience from being hit by Tsukuyomi several times before, but never on the scale of what a healthy Itachi could use.
