It's important to know this: you will have to style this every day, probably blow dry after showering and put product in it or it may not look good at all. It's not that bad, I do it every day.\n\n2. I am confident you could achieve 1 if you practiced styling, 2 and 3 are probably a bit more curly than you can achieve but it's hard to tell how curly it is with the hair pulled back.\n\nHere's what you do, find a good hair stylist, maybe someone used to cutting men's hair / these styles, and show them all of these pictures so they know *exactly* what you're going for.\n\nOnce you have the cut, the maintenance and styling are just as important. If you want to go curlier, do the [curly girl method](https://imgur.com/FA7kPST). Based on the fact that you say your hair forms ringlets at times, I bet if you stopped using shampoo (esp with sulfates / silicones) and wash with conditioner every day instead, your hair would get curlier. It might surprise you.\n\nFor the styling, what I recommend is this. Get out of the shower, towel dry your hair with a microfiber towel (to reduce frizziness), then turn your hair upside-down and blow dry it on warm using a diffuser (to reduce frizziness). Blow dry it up and back (to give it more lift). You shouldn't really need to anyway, but only ever comb/brush it when wet, using a loosely bristled plastic brush/comb (also to reduce frizziness).\n\nWhen it's dry, then take some **american crew forming cream** (not CGM-approved but I love it anyway for curls / waves) and sweep it through your hair up and back, and try to style it as you will.\n\nAnd come back and show us!",

If your hair is wet while you run it through, it is much more likely to have that stiff, crunchy texture. It may have a softer effect if you dry your hair more before applying it. And I sometimes use pomade while my hair is still damp and then comb it after it sets, which in my experience gives it a stronger hold while also having a softer look.\n\nAs far as your question, every brand will be a bit different, but a putty is typically thicker and gives a stronger hold. A forming cream will probably be a bit easier to run through your hair and will have a lighter hold. I'd definitely recommend trying out different products to find what fits you best. Whenever I get my hair cut, I generally ask the barber to style my hair with a product I haven't tried before. It's a good way to sample before you buy.",

It's important to know this: you will have to style this every day, probably blow dry after showering and put product in it or it may not look good at all. It's not that bad, I do it every day.\n\n2. I am confident you could achieve 1 if you practiced styling, 2 and 3 are probably a bit more curly than you can achieve but it's hard to tell how curly it is with the hair pulled back.\n\nHere's what you do, find a good hair stylist, maybe someone used to cutting men's hair / these styles, and show them all of these pictures so they know *exactly* what you're going for.\n\nOnce you have the cut, the maintenance and styling are just as important. If you want to go curlier, do the [curly girl method](https://imgur.com/FA7kPST). Based on the fact that you say your hair forms ringlets at times, I bet if you stopped using shampoo (esp with sulfates / silicones) and wash with conditioner every day instead, your hair would get curlier. It might surprise you.\n\nFor the styling, what I recommend is this. Get out of the shower, towel dry your hair with a microfiber towel (to reduce frizziness), then turn your hair upside-down and blow dry it on warm using a diffuser (to reduce frizziness). Blow dry it up and back (to give it more lift). You shouldn't really need to anyway, but only ever comb/brush it when wet, using a loosely bristled plastic brush/comb (also to reduce frizziness).\n\nWhen it's dry, then take some **american crew forming cream** (not CGM-approved but I love it anyway for curls / waves) and sweep it through your hair up and back, and try to style it as you will.\n\nAnd come back and show us!",

If your hair is wet while you run it through, it is much more likely to have that stiff, crunchy texture. It may have a softer effect if you dry your hair more before applying it. And I sometimes use pomade while my hair is still damp and then comb it after it sets, which in my experience gives it a stronger hold while also having a softer look.\n\nAs far as your question, every brand will be a bit different, but a putty is typically thicker and gives a stronger hold. A forming cream will probably be a bit easier to run through your hair and will have a lighter hold. I'd definitely recommend trying out different products to find what fits you best. Whenever I get my hair cut, I generally ask the barber to style my hair with a product I haven't tried before. It's a good way to sample before you buy.",

And I sometimes use pomade while my hair is still damp and then comb it after it sets, which in my experience gives it a stronger hold while also having a softer look.\n\nAs far as your question, every brand will be a bit different, but a putty is typically thicker and gives a stronger hold. A forming cream will probably be a bit easier to run through your hair and will have a lighter hold. I'd definitely recommend trying out different products to find what fits you best. Whenever I get my hair cut, I generally ask the barber to style my hair with a product I haven't tried before. It's a good way to sample before you buy.",

If your hair is wet while you run it through, it is much more likely to have that stiff, crunchy texture. It may have a softer effect if you dry your hair more before applying it. And I sometimes use pomade while my hair is still damp and then comb it after it sets, which in my experience gives it a stronger hold while also having a softer look.\n\nAs far as your question, every brand will be a bit different, but a putty is typically thicker and gives a stronger hold. A forming cream will probably be a bit easier to run through your hair and will have a lighter hold. I'd definitely recommend trying out different products to find what fits you best. Whenever I get my hair cut, I generally ask the barber to style my hair with a product I haven't tried before. It's a good way to sample before you buy.",
