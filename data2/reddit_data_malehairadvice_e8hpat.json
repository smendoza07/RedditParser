Over the next few days I couldn't do it at all.  I would get very light-headed and feel nauseated with chest pains and a heartbeat that was like Speedy Gonzalez. I've had chest pains most days for a decade because of fairly severe anxiety, so I assumed the light-headedNess was related.  But over the next few days, the symptoms were getting much more severe and constant around the clock.  It honestly felt like I was going to die.  I went to urgent Care where the doctor said minoxidil can cause the symptoms I had. My blood pressure was dangerously low. I was given some water pills, a cardiologist referral just in case, and I was told to stop using it, which of course I did.\n\nBy the fourth day of not using, the symptoms started to change from severe to mild, and I could start to move about again.  I'm now 9 days since stopping, and the light-headed Ness is still there, but I'm able to function mostly normal again.  I just can't resume exercising yet as even walking exacerbates the symptoms.  It could take a few more weeks to get it out of my system.\n\nI don't mean to discourage anyone from trying Minoxidil, as it has worked for so many without issue, but if you're getting symptoms like I did, might be worth knowing there can be, rarely, pretty bad side effects.",

Over the next few days I couldn't do it at all.  I would get very light-headed and feel nauseated with chest pains and a heartbeat that was like Speedy Gonzalez. I've had chest pains most days for a decade because of fairly severe anxiety, so I assumed the light-headedNess was related.  But over the next few days, the symptoms were getting much more severe and constant around the clock.  It honestly felt like I was going to die.  I went to urgent Care where the doctor said minoxidil can cause the symptoms I had. My blood pressure was dangerously low. I was given some water pills, a cardiologist referral just in case, and I was told to stop using it, which of course I did.\n\nBy the fourth day of not using, the symptoms started to change from severe to mild, and I could start to move about again.  I'm now 9 days since stopping, and the light-headed Ness is still there, but I'm able to function mostly normal again.  I just can't resume exercising yet as even walking exacerbates the symptoms.  It could take a few more weeks to get it out of my system.\n\nI don't mean to discourage anyone from trying Minoxidil, as it has worked for so many without issue, but if you're getting symptoms like I did, might be worth knowing there can be, rarely, pretty bad side effects.",

Over the next few days I couldn't do it at all.  I would get very light-headed and feel nauseated with chest pains and a heartbeat that was like Speedy Gonzalez. I've had chest pains most days for a decade because of fairly severe anxiety, so I assumed the light-headedNess was related.  But over the next few days, the symptoms were getting much more severe and constant around the clock.  It honestly felt like I was going to die.  I went to urgent Care where the doctor said minoxidil can cause the symptoms I had. My blood pressure was dangerously low. I was given some water pills, a cardiologist referral just in case, and I was told to stop using it, which of course I did.\n\nBy the fourth day of not using, the symptoms started to change from severe to mild, and I could start to move about again.  I'm now 9 days since stopping, and the light-headed Ness is still there, but I'm able to function mostly normal again.  I just can't resume exercising yet as even walking exacerbates the symptoms.  It could take a few more weeks to get it out of my system.\n\nI don't mean to discourage anyone from trying Minoxidil, as it has worked for so many without issue, but if you're getting symptoms like I did, might be worth knowing there can be, rarely, pretty bad side effects.",

I would get very light-headed and feel nauseated with chest pains and a heartbeat that was like Speedy Gonzalez. I've had chest pains most days for a decade because of fairly severe anxiety, so I assumed the light-headedNess was related.  But over the next few days, the symptoms were getting much more severe and constant around the clock.  It honestly felt like I was going to die.  I went to urgent Care where the doctor said minoxidil can cause the symptoms I had. My blood pressure was dangerously low. I was given some water pills, a cardiologist referral just in case, and I was told to stop using it, which of course I did.\n\nBy the fourth day of not using, the symptoms started to change from severe to mild, and I could start to move about again.  I'm now 9 days since stopping, and the light-headed Ness is still there, but I'm able to function mostly normal again.  I just can't resume exercising yet as even walking exacerbates the symptoms.  It could take a few more weeks to get it out of my system.\n\nI don't mean to discourage anyone from trying Minoxidil, as it has worked for so many without issue, but if you're getting symptoms like I did, might be worth knowing there can be, rarely, pretty bad side effects.",
