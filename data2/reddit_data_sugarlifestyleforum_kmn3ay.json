    "body": "So, I used to work in mortgage where I came across a shit ton of rich younger guys (30\u2019s) who just all around sucked. They were condescending, elitist, and their money seemed to have erased all manners from their system. The men in their late 40s+, however, were always kind, sweet, and had not a single air condescension no matter who they were speaking to.\n\nAt the time, I chalked it up to the industry - there\u2019s a generational turnover happening there. \n\nSince I\u2019ve been back in the bowl for a few weeks, I\u2019ve been running into 30-something SDs (I know, I know) and naturally haven\u2019t been taking them very seriously. There have been a few that have been very persistent and took action to show they were serious about an arrangement. \n\nHowever. These 30-something rich guys are the EXACT same as the clowns I worked with. They have absolutely no manners and hide their rudeness behind statements like \u201cI call it as I see it\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m extremely direct.\u201d \n\nI just got off a phone screen with a POT 36yo sd (I am 32) who actually said to me \u201cyou know, all my previous SBs have been 20-23. You\u2019ll be the first in her thirties. This is going to be really different for me. Don\u2019t you feel honored?\u201d \n\nNo, asshole. I don\u2019t feel honored. \n\nMoral of the story, skip men in their thirties entirely. Just ignore them completely. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk y\u2019all.",

Being \u201cbrutally honest\u201d isn\u2019t a personality trait worth bragging about nor is it an excuse for being an absolute prick. \n\nI had a 33 year old POT message me last week. His profile was set up for him and his (male) friend. He tried three times to convince me to come spend an evening at their Christmas week beach house cooking for them. After turning him down twice, citing the pandemic as my excuse for not meeting up with a strange man at their rental house to serve them, I finally took the bait and asked what was in it for me. He told me, absolutely not ironically, that I could take the third bedroom in their beach house for the week, eat/drink whatever I wanted, and fuck whichever of them I pleased. He tried to pitch it as a vacation, but the beach he was traveling to is a beach that I live at and don\u2019t need to serve two dudes for days on end in order to spend time enjoying. \ud83d\ude02",

Because I have three sisters that I\u2019m close to I do have thoughts of \u201c is this how I would want one of my sisters to be treated by a guy\u201d in reflecting upon my own actions and behaviors when I am with a woman.

Some of us really are trying to do this right and find a good meaningful SR built on mutual respect. Discounting younger SDs out of hand limits choices on both sides and makes it a little harder for everyone to find the right situation for themselves.\n\nI don't expect to change your mind about this, but I still wanted to at least voice my perspective as a younger SD who is hopefully not an asshole. I hope you can find what your looking for and get into the right kind of SR for yourself with someone who will treat you with respect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: this thread makes me sad. The fact that so many SDs have done the awful things I have read so far is completely unacceptable. I just want everyone to know that we are not all like this.",

So these young rich men in their 20s and 30s get away with being arrogant, rude and just overall bad personality as many women give them pass for it. You see it with Athlets all the time, they treat women badly but still get pass from everyone because they are young handsome, rich and famous. \n\nOn top of that, young rich men who enter sugar bowl have even more personality issues and tend to be arrogant with their early success. SDs in their 30s think they can just get women without putting much effort in it. I realized men who had work really hard for their success understand the reality and more humble.",

My mother was not in the picture from 12 on. My grandmas were my mother figures. ALSO, because one of them has advance Alzheimer's for the last handful of years I helped take care of her after work and on weekends (so almost every day of the week for a few hours) until Corona started. My other grandmother moved to Florida and I talked to her for a couple hours a week on the phone until she passed away Spring 2019. \n\nI am close with my living Grandfather, yes, but he can either be a majorly nice and funny guy, or a major asshole. My grandmas were just nice and motherly.",

Then I made sufficient enough money to lose the 80-100 hour work week and traveled and dated to my heart\u2019s content. Id love to think im a better person/partner for that.\n\nThe point is, a man in his 30s thats sugaring is probably new at it, can and probably will change, and with the right partner, develop into a better human being.\n\nThat said, you may be too mature emotionally for us, i say go ahead and pay us no mind and skip to the end! But you may find a path with no obstacles incredibly boring.",

All I\u2019m saying is that if an SB comes across an SD your age, it\u2019s more than likely that something along the lines of what I - and other SBs in comments - have noted here will occur. \n\nAs I said above, there are some exceptions to the rule. I\u2019m sure there are. Have I heard about them from people I trust in the bowl or experienced those exceptions myself? No, but I\u2019m sure there are still exceptions. \n\nThe rule stands though.",
