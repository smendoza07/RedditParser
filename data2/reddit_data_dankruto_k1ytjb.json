It\u2019s in-line with the themes the story is tryna tell. \n\nPlus I don\u2019t even think Naruto would even *attempt* (he never tried to anyways) TNJ against the likes of Orochimaru, Deidara, Kakazu, ect, because what would he even say.

But it could also be argued he doesn\u2019t mind killing people who he deems actually evil, because there\u2019s really no way he would know that his rasenshuriken wouldn\u2019t kill Kakuzu (so his intent was probably to kill).",
