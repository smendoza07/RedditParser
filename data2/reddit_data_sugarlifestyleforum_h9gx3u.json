    "body": "Sometimes. I realize many SBs take the NSA approach, but I think some of the old school SBs may feel similarly. Surely, I\u2019m not the only one. \n\nWhen I made an account on SA last year, I didn\u2019t know what I would find and wasn\u2019t really sure how to articulate what I was looking for. I\u2019ve  come to realize that I have found exactly what I was looking for and so much more. \n\nThe general feel throughout the Sugar Bowl is that a SB is to put on their \u201cbest face\u201d and create a fantasy experience for their SD. I\u2019m so glad that I have found a man that wants me to be me, the real me. He wants me with or without makeup, happy or sad (I\u2019m a pretty upbeat person in general), and to be my shoulder to cry on. He wants to know what obstacles I face so he can help me through them.\n\nWe are both very aware of our true realities:\n- We have a 30+ age gap\n- He\u2019s married\n- I have young children\n\nI have many various wounds from vanilla dating that make me very hesitant to pursue a traditional \u201cforever\u201d relationship. My SD fulfills my fantasy of having a deep, meaningful connection with a long term lover. He gives me the financial fantasy and freedom of having a two income household. (I don\u2019t receive child support.) He takes care of my every need and encourages me to provide a full life for myself and my children. He is the most romantic man I have ever met and has exceeded my expectations many times over.\n\nI am so happy to have found this truly amazing man and yet, somehow, he thinks he\u2019s the lucky one. \n\nTLDR: Some SBs want to the live the \u201ctaken care of\u201d fantasy, but not necessarily in the ways one might initially think.",

            "body": "As an SB myself I\u2019m always hesitant after hearing about the norms of sugar relationships and how to apply it to my own. I always worry about overstepping my boundaries with my SD whether it being emotional, physical, personal etc. So this was quite reassuring to hear from another SB with a married SD that a deeper level of connection is possible and has been made from sugaring. \n\nStay happy girl, you deserve it! x",

I was hesitant at first and have opened up slowly, but I\u2019m a little surprised actually with some of the things I\u2019ve shared. I never expected to go there with a SD.\n\nIt is possible!

As I've said many times, it's my nightmare that my long term SB feels like she has to be \"on\" all the time... I'm hoping we're both our relaxed real selves.",

I dated a wonderful SB years ago and it took me too long to realize that she also enjoyed the fantasy, a \u201crich boyfriend,\u201d a life of ease, the restaurants and trips...to pretend to be the high-society girl she never got to be. That it wasn\u2019t just about being helped financially, but that when she chatted and spent time with me, she could forget about her grueling deadend job, her psychotic roommate, her tortured family relationship, and the dust many of her dreams had become. I wasn\u2019t her white knight \u2014 I was her white lie she could tell herself, and a way to find magic as the threads of years pulled through her fingers. I feel honored I was able to bring her joy, brief as it was.",
