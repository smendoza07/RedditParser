International fans who wonder why the [3 letter acrostic poems are so popular in K-Variety would learn so in a small window in the corner.](http://atkmagazine.com/2016/10/19/korean-word-games-seen-korean-variety-shows/)\n\nIt's also nice to learn some things of Korean culture such as food.\n\nBut the biggest casualty of the lack of trivial subs would be the jokes. Everyone on this show can throw barbs or light humor in the spirit of fun. Those jokes mostly fall lost due to the speed of the translation for longer dialogue.\n\nAll these small things add up to a bigger involvement for the viewer and it's such a shame we don't have something like that now.",

            "body": "Around the same time period, or maybe even a bit earlier than that, anime subs also does the same thing. I can't think of one particular subgroup, but there were a lot of good ones (and I can only remember the troll groups at the tip of my tongue right now). They will write karaoke lyrics for opening and ending songs, and write translator notes for jokes, honorifics and references. They'll even do crazy typesetting to fit the opening and ending theme animations! It was a free market for many shows, with lots of roles such as typesetting, editors, translators, timers, etc. A full team that's not paid, mind you! It usually takes around 1 week for it to be subbed from getting the RAW version of the show (not aired, mind you!) since many are busy with their actually paid full time jobs. Until anime fans who barely knows a lick of Japanese started criticising about translation issues, quality issues and kept spamming their websites why it takes them VERY long from the air date to sub. Until eventually most got fed up by the constant demanding fans, plus the fact that their translations are scrutinised each week as well as the rise of companies like Crunchyroll made them think \"fuck it, I'm not paid at all for this shit!\". These are 20minute shows but with so much work to do and passion can only take them for so long. \n\n\nI can't even begin to imagine the hardwork iSubs put into Running Man during those period of time especially for a 1hr30min live action show where people often tend to talk at the same time, and with Korean texts on the screen to translate as well. I'm pretty sure that they also encountered the same problem as back then (there is literally no difference in attitude between an anime fan and a kpop fan are) and I understand why they are now defunct. I really can't appreciate them enough, the quality they gave to the show was always good and their passion shows. I hope those people who worked on iSubs are enjoying their life now, proud that they are one of the people who made Running Man be recognised internationally. Infinite Challenge was more popular in Korea but it didn't catch on unlike RM internationally since they didn't have a dedicated team of subber. So iSubs may technically be one of the reasons RM is still airing today compared to its competitors",
