    "body": "I knew he cared about me and loved me in whatever way you can in this sort of relationship..\n\nBut when I officially lost my job because of COVID yesterday and was ready to drop my classes for the next semester.. he was the one who came through. Immediately my entire semesters tuition in my paypal. I cried. It\u2019s not THAT much money, but to me in my uncertain situation it meant everything to me to be able to continue my education without interruption. I support most of my family financially and this is honestly the first time where someone said, \u201cHey.. I have this. Relax and keep doing exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nNot to mention that he fully believes in me and what I\u2019m capable of and only wants to see me succeed in every way. \n\nHe was the only one to follow through (even after some big talk from others) and I cannot wait until this is over and I get to see him again. I have a feeling he\u2019s going to love my way of thanking him \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude1c\ud83e\udd70",

If the SD had financial troubles, would you see him and let him give you your ppm 10 weeks later? I guess not.\n\nThen you need to return the favour. I don't know the arrangement between you two but you need to return the favour to let him know that it matters to you.\n\nFor me, I was new to this sb and she was nearly kicked out of college for late fees. Long story short, I decided to step up and covered it for her.\n\nThe fees was 10xppm and she somehow calculated it as 8xppm. Which is fine with me as it is not a big deal for me.\n\nThen she started coming to date late by one hour and leaving early. And cancelling date last minute after I had already arrived at her town.\n\nIn the end, I cut my losses and stopped seeing her, with 5 ppm still outstanding.\n\nShe never understood why I threw those monies away. She never did. I was just disappointed.\n\nSo don't be that SB.",
