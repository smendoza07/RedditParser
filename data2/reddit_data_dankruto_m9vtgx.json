There was so much they could have done with Sasuke's character, so many ways they could have written his story to play out differently than the original--something fanfiction writers have been doing for years now. Hell, even sticking with the basic storyline where Sasuke ends up joining Orochimaru, there are ton of different ways they could have rewritten that, but they decided on that weak shit. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you have any ideas for how they could've written Sasuke differently this AU? Or better yet, if you could have written a canon divergence storyline like the filler, how would it differ from the original series and the filler's AU?",

                                                    "body": "That's brilliant. Also, if the curse mark amplifies negative emotions such as rage and jealousy, I'm sure it could have intensified Sasuke's fears and paranoias as well. For instance, Sasuke's fears that he wouldn't be strong enough to stop the Sound Four if they went after the people closest to him, and the idea that they would continue to pose a threat to Konoha so long as Sasuke remained in the Village. Hell in the original canon it's stated that the Village's resources were stretched thin in the months following Orochimaru's assault during the Chunin Exams, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to attack or infiltration by outside forces. That fact was proven as much when Itachi and Kisame showed up, fought four Jonins, put Kakashi in a coma, and only left because they realized Naruto wasn't there. Even if the village does manage to ward off attacks by the Sound Four, the resources and manpower required to do so would be taking away from the rest of their defenses, leaving them even more open to attack. \n\nNot to mention that the Sound Four could play some serious mind games with Sasuke to get their point across. Even if they don't go after the rest of Team 7 directly, they could begin offing random civilians or shinobi and leaving clues at the crime scene indicating that they were the ones doing it, such as the curse mark's symbol written in blood on a wall or the floor nearby--and heavily implying that Naruto or Sakura or Kakashi could be next by choosing victims that resemble the other members of Team 7, or by altering the corpses so they posses their most easily recognizable features, such as carving Naruto's whisker markings into one of the victim's cheeks with a blade, giving a female victim a headband worn in the exact same way Sakura wears hers and dying her hair pink, or putting a mask on one of the corpses that covers the lower half of the victim's face and wrapping a strip of fabric around their head so that it covers their left eye, so that they look just like Kakashi. Actually, since the curse mark is made up of three tomoe, maybe they could just cut the heads off all three of the victims and arrange them in a pattern on the floor so that the blood stains and drag marks look like the curse mark symbol. They could set it up in a way that makes Sasuke more likely to be the first person to stumble across the crime scene by stalking him for a few days ahead of time to learn his routine, scouting out which areas Sasuke visits most frequently (preferably alone) and at what times, and then when the time comes for the actual killings they leave the bodies in those exact locations a little while before the time Sasuke usually arrives. This of course would also alert Sasuke to the fact that they're watching him constantly, which would make anyone paranoid, and it would further enforce the idea that no place is safe from the Sound Four. Here's another idea; before the murders begin, the Sound Four will just start off by leaving ominous shit on Sasuke's doorstep or window sill, like a dead fox with one of it's eyes ripped out that's been impaled by a cherry blossom branch, maybe with some instant ramen mixed into it's exposed guts where they spill out of it's abdomen and a bloodstained copy of Icha Icha paradise laying between it's front paws. Bonus points if a crow just happens to be picking at the remains when Sasuke sees it. Okay, the ominous warnings probably wouldn't be that elaborate right off the bat--maybe they'd start by placing a dead frog that's been stabbed with a kunai inside an empty cup of instant ramen and stuffing it in his mailbox, and then work their way up to the fox over several weeks of leaving increasingly disturbing shit laying around for Sasuke to find. \n\nOops, this took quite a macabre turn. Didn't mean to go on a psychological horror on you, I guess I just found myself getting inspired. But even if the mind games weren't quite as severe as those conjured by my own twisted imagination, I can imagine Sasuke would still get the memo that his teammates and the other villagers will never be even remotely safe until Orochimaru gets what he wants. Even if it's not an overwhelming all out attack like the assault that was launched during the Chunin Exams, these stealth based infiltration operations would be devastatingly effective at undermining any sense of security Sasuke feels within Konoha, and any faith he has that the village would be able to protect his teammates. As it stands he feels helpless to do anything about it, but if he were to train hard enough under Orochimaru, he might eventually become strong enough to kill the snake and eliminate the threat he poses to himself and Konoha altogether. Failure means losing his body and becoming a vessel for Orochimaru, but if he succeeds, the payoff would be incredible. Also, he'd have the strength necessary to kill his brother (who is coincidentally a member of the Akatsuki, meaning that he is a threat to Konoha and especially to Naruto) and avenge the death of his family. \n\nNow THAT would be a badass plot.",

One of the things I hated about Shippuden is that no one really felt like friends or that they even liked each other (or at least Team 7 to anyone else). The only person who felt like they had an actual relationship with someone outside their team was Sakura, Lee, and Ino. Lee may have not been particular close to anyone, but his attempts felt more genuine. This was also one of the only ways to get content about anyone other than Team 7, which is necessary because Team 7 aren\u2019t the only people living interesting lives here. I may have been a bit irritated and uneasy about the tone \u201cshift\u201d with Sasuke being absent, but in hindsight, it makes sense and makes me appreciate it more. Life doesn\u2019t need to be put on pause because of Sasuke - they\u2019re still ninja with a job to do, and a life to live.",

Shame that we had to see it in filler, i think whether you like sasuke or not this episode made you smile and like him just a little better even if it\u2019s not much. \n\nHell if they made a side series where we got to see episodes like this i would have definitely watched it, although i don\u2019t want them to do that anymore due to the art style as since that has changed it won\u2019t feel the same. it doesn\u2019t hold the same charm as the original art style for when they were kids. Even in shippuden when they did flashbacks to when they were kids it didn\u2019t feel right because of how simple and fluid they made the animation and art style. \n\nBut oh well, shows over.

There was so much they could have done with Sasuke's character, so many ways they could have written his story to play out differently than the original--something fanfiction writers have been doing for years now. Hell, even sticking with the basic storyline where Sasuke ends up joining Orochimaru, there are ton of different ways they could have rewritten that, but they decided on that weak shit. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you have any ideas for how they could've written Sasuke differently this AU? Or better yet, if you could have written a canon divergence storyline like the filler, how would it differ from the original series and the filler's AU?",

                                            "body": "That's brilliant. Also, if the curse mark amplifies negative emotions such as rage and jealousy, I'm sure it could have intensified Sasuke's fears and paranoias as well. For instance, Sasuke's fears that he wouldn't be strong enough to stop the Sound Four if they went after the people closest to him, and the idea that they would continue to pose a threat to Konoha so long as Sasuke remained in the Village. Hell in the original canon it's stated that the Village's resources were stretched thin in the months following Orochimaru's assault during the Chunin Exams, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to attack or infiltration by outside forces. That fact was proven as much when Itachi and Kisame showed up, fought four Jonins, put Kakashi in a coma, and only left because they realized Naruto wasn't there. Even if the village does manage to ward off attacks by the Sound Four, the resources and manpower required to do so would be taking away from the rest of their defenses, leaving them even more open to attack. \n\nNot to mention that the Sound Four could play some serious mind games with Sasuke to get their point across. Even if they don't go after the rest of Team 7 directly, they could begin offing random civilians or shinobi and leaving clues at the crime scene indicating that they were the ones doing it, such as the curse mark's symbol written in blood on a wall or the floor nearby--and heavily implying that Naruto or Sakura or Kakashi could be next by choosing victims that resemble the other members of Team 7, or by altering the corpses so they posses their most easily recognizable features, such as carving Naruto's whisker markings into one of the victim's cheeks with a blade, giving a female victim a headband worn in the exact same way Sakura wears hers and dying her hair pink, or putting a mask on one of the corpses that covers the lower half of the victim's face and wrapping a strip of fabric around their head so that it covers their left eye, so that they look just like Kakashi. Actually, since the curse mark is made up of three tomoe, maybe they could just cut the heads off all three of the victims and arrange them in a pattern on the floor so that the blood stains and drag marks look like the curse mark symbol. They could set it up in a way that makes Sasuke more likely to be the first person to stumble across the crime scene by stalking him for a few days ahead of time to learn his routine, scouting out which areas Sasuke visits most frequently (preferably alone) and at what times, and then when the time comes for the actual killings they leave the bodies in those exact locations a little while before the time Sasuke usually arrives. This of course would also alert Sasuke to the fact that they're watching him constantly, which would make anyone paranoid, and it would further enforce the idea that no place is safe from the Sound Four. Here's another idea; before the murders begin, the Sound Four will just start off by leaving ominous shit on Sasuke's doorstep or window sill, like a dead fox with one of it's eyes ripped out that's been impaled by a cherry blossom branch, maybe with some instant ramen mixed into it's exposed guts where they spill out of it's abdomen and a bloodstained copy of Icha Icha paradise laying between it's front paws. Bonus points if a crow just happens to be picking at the remains when Sasuke sees it. Okay, the ominous warnings probably wouldn't be that elaborate right off the bat--maybe they'd start by placing a dead frog that's been stabbed with a kunai inside an empty cup of instant ramen and stuffing it in his mailbox, and then work their way up to the fox over several weeks of leaving increasingly disturbing shit laying around for Sasuke to find. \n\nOops, this took quite a macabre turn. Didn't mean to go on a psychological horror on you, I guess I just found myself getting inspired. But even if the mind games weren't quite as severe as those conjured by my own twisted imagination, I can imagine Sasuke would still get the memo that his teammates and the other villagers will never be even remotely safe until Orochimaru gets what he wants. Even if it's not an overwhelming all out attack like the assault that was launched during the Chunin Exams, these stealth based infiltration operations would be devastatingly effective at undermining any sense of security Sasuke feels within Konoha, and any faith he has that the village would be able to protect his teammates. As it stands he feels helpless to do anything about it, but if he were to train hard enough under Orochimaru, he might eventually become strong enough to kill the snake and eliminate the threat he poses to himself and Konoha altogether. Failure means losing his body and becoming a vessel for Orochimaru, but if he succeeds, the payoff would be incredible. Also, he'd have the strength necessary to kill his brother (who is coincidentally a member of the Akatsuki, meaning that he is a threat to Konoha and especially to Naruto) and avenge the death of his family. \n\nNow THAT would be a badass plot.",

There was so much they could have done with Sasuke's character, so many ways they could have written his story to play out differently than the original--something fanfiction writers have been doing for years now. Hell, even sticking with the basic storyline where Sasuke ends up joining Orochimaru, there are ton of different ways they could have rewritten that, but they decided on that weak shit. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you have any ideas for how they could've written Sasuke differently this AU? Or better yet, if you could have written a canon divergence storyline like the filler, how would it differ from the original series and the filler's AU?",

                                    "body": "That's brilliant. Also, if the curse mark amplifies negative emotions such as rage and jealousy, I'm sure it could have intensified Sasuke's fears and paranoias as well. For instance, Sasuke's fears that he wouldn't be strong enough to stop the Sound Four if they went after the people closest to him, and the idea that they would continue to pose a threat to Konoha so long as Sasuke remained in the Village. Hell in the original canon it's stated that the Village's resources were stretched thin in the months following Orochimaru's assault during the Chunin Exams, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to attack or infiltration by outside forces. That fact was proven as much when Itachi and Kisame showed up, fought four Jonins, put Kakashi in a coma, and only left because they realized Naruto wasn't there. Even if the village does manage to ward off attacks by the Sound Four, the resources and manpower required to do so would be taking away from the rest of their defenses, leaving them even more open to attack. \n\nNot to mention that the Sound Four could play some serious mind games with Sasuke to get their point across. Even if they don't go after the rest of Team 7 directly, they could begin offing random civilians or shinobi and leaving clues at the crime scene indicating that they were the ones doing it, such as the curse mark's symbol written in blood on a wall or the floor nearby--and heavily implying that Naruto or Sakura or Kakashi could be next by choosing victims that resemble the other members of Team 7, or by altering the corpses so they posses their most easily recognizable features, such as carving Naruto's whisker markings into one of the victim's cheeks with a blade, giving a female victim a headband worn in the exact same way Sakura wears hers and dying her hair pink, or putting a mask on one of the corpses that covers the lower half of the victim's face and wrapping a strip of fabric around their head so that it covers their left eye, so that they look just like Kakashi. Actually, since the curse mark is made up of three tomoe, maybe they could just cut the heads off all three of the victims and arrange them in a pattern on the floor so that the blood stains and drag marks look like the curse mark symbol. They could set it up in a way that makes Sasuke more likely to be the first person to stumble across the crime scene by stalking him for a few days ahead of time to learn his routine, scouting out which areas Sasuke visits most frequently (preferably alone) and at what times, and then when the time comes for the actual killings they leave the bodies in those exact locations a little while before the time Sasuke usually arrives. This of course would also alert Sasuke to the fact that they're watching him constantly, which would make anyone paranoid, and it would further enforce the idea that no place is safe from the Sound Four. Here's another idea; before the murders begin, the Sound Four will just start off by leaving ominous shit on Sasuke's doorstep or window sill, like a dead fox with one of it's eyes ripped out that's been impaled by a cherry blossom branch, maybe with some instant ramen mixed into it's exposed guts where they spill out of it's abdomen and a bloodstained copy of Icha Icha paradise laying between it's front paws. Bonus points if a crow just happens to be picking at the remains when Sasuke sees it. Okay, the ominous warnings probably wouldn't be that elaborate right off the bat--maybe they'd start by placing a dead frog that's been stabbed with a kunai inside an empty cup of instant ramen and stuffing it in his mailbox, and then work their way up to the fox over several weeks of leaving increasingly disturbing shit laying around for Sasuke to find. \n\nOops, this took quite a macabre turn. Didn't mean to go on a psychological horror on you, I guess I just found myself getting inspired. But even if the mind games weren't quite as severe as those conjured by my own twisted imagination, I can imagine Sasuke would still get the memo that his teammates and the other villagers will never be even remotely safe until Orochimaru gets what he wants. Even if it's not an overwhelming all out attack like the assault that was launched during the Chunin Exams, these stealth based infiltration operations would be devastatingly effective at undermining any sense of security Sasuke feels within Konoha, and any faith he has that the village would be able to protect his teammates. As it stands he feels helpless to do anything about it, but if he were to train hard enough under Orochimaru, he might eventually become strong enough to kill the snake and eliminate the threat he poses to himself and Konoha altogether. Failure means losing his body and becoming a vessel for Orochimaru, but if he succeeds, the payoff would be incredible. Also, he'd have the strength necessary to kill his brother (who is coincidentally a member of the Akatsuki, meaning that he is a threat to Konoha and especially to Naruto) and avenge the death of his family. \n\nNow THAT would be a badass plot.",

There was so much they could have done with Sasuke's character, so many ways they could have written his story to play out differently than the original--something fanfiction writers have been doing for years now. Hell, even sticking with the basic storyline where Sasuke ends up joining Orochimaru, there are ton of different ways they could have rewritten that, but they decided on that weak shit. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you have any ideas for how they could've written Sasuke differently this AU? Or better yet, if you could have written a canon divergence storyline like the filler, how would it differ from the original series and the filler's AU?",

                            "body": "That's brilliant. Also, if the curse mark amplifies negative emotions such as rage and jealousy, I'm sure it could have intensified Sasuke's fears and paranoias as well. For instance, Sasuke's fears that he wouldn't be strong enough to stop the Sound Four if they went after the people closest to him, and the idea that they would continue to pose a threat to Konoha so long as Sasuke remained in the Village. Hell in the original canon it's stated that the Village's resources were stretched thin in the months following Orochimaru's assault during the Chunin Exams, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to attack or infiltration by outside forces. That fact was proven as much when Itachi and Kisame showed up, fought four Jonins, put Kakashi in a coma, and only left because they realized Naruto wasn't there. Even if the village does manage to ward off attacks by the Sound Four, the resources and manpower required to do so would be taking away from the rest of their defenses, leaving them even more open to attack. \n\nNot to mention that the Sound Four could play some serious mind games with Sasuke to get their point across. Even if they don't go after the rest of Team 7 directly, they could begin offing random civilians or shinobi and leaving clues at the crime scene indicating that they were the ones doing it, such as the curse mark's symbol written in blood on a wall or the floor nearby--and heavily implying that Naruto or Sakura or Kakashi could be next by choosing victims that resemble the other members of Team 7, or by altering the corpses so they posses their most easily recognizable features, such as carving Naruto's whisker markings into one of the victim's cheeks with a blade, giving a female victim a headband worn in the exact same way Sakura wears hers and dying her hair pink, or putting a mask on one of the corpses that covers the lower half of the victim's face and wrapping a strip of fabric around their head so that it covers their left eye, so that they look just like Kakashi. Actually, since the curse mark is made up of three tomoe, maybe they could just cut the heads off all three of the victims and arrange them in a pattern on the floor so that the blood stains and drag marks look like the curse mark symbol. They could set it up in a way that makes Sasuke more likely to be the first person to stumble across the crime scene by stalking him for a few days ahead of time to learn his routine, scouting out which areas Sasuke visits most frequently (preferably alone) and at what times, and then when the time comes for the actual killings they leave the bodies in those exact locations a little while before the time Sasuke usually arrives. This of course would also alert Sasuke to the fact that they're watching him constantly, which would make anyone paranoid, and it would further enforce the idea that no place is safe from the Sound Four. Here's another idea; before the murders begin, the Sound Four will just start off by leaving ominous shit on Sasuke's doorstep or window sill, like a dead fox with one of it's eyes ripped out that's been impaled by a cherry blossom branch, maybe with some instant ramen mixed into it's exposed guts where they spill out of it's abdomen and a bloodstained copy of Icha Icha paradise laying between it's front paws. Bonus points if a crow just happens to be picking at the remains when Sasuke sees it. Okay, the ominous warnings probably wouldn't be that elaborate right off the bat--maybe they'd start by placing a dead frog that's been stabbed with a kunai inside an empty cup of instant ramen and stuffing it in his mailbox, and then work their way up to the fox over several weeks of leaving increasingly disturbing shit laying around for Sasuke to find. \n\nOops, this took quite a macabre turn. Didn't mean to go on a psychological horror on you, I guess I just found myself getting inspired. But even if the mind games weren't quite as severe as those conjured by my own twisted imagination, I can imagine Sasuke would still get the memo that his teammates and the other villagers will never be even remotely safe until Orochimaru gets what he wants. Even if it's not an overwhelming all out attack like the assault that was launched during the Chunin Exams, these stealth based infiltration operations would be devastatingly effective at undermining any sense of security Sasuke feels within Konoha, and any faith he has that the village would be able to protect his teammates. As it stands he feels helpless to do anything about it, but if he were to train hard enough under Orochimaru, he might eventually become strong enough to kill the snake and eliminate the threat he poses to himself and Konoha altogether. Failure means losing his body and becoming a vessel for Orochimaru, but if he succeeds, the payoff would be incredible. Also, he'd have the strength necessary to kill his brother (who is coincidentally a member of the Akatsuki, meaning that he is a threat to Konoha and especially to Naruto) and avenge the death of his family. \n\nNow THAT would be a badass plot.",

                    "body": "That's brilliant. Also, if the curse mark amplifies negative emotions such as rage and jealousy, I'm sure it could have intensified Sasuke's fears and paranoias as well. For instance, Sasuke's fears that he wouldn't be strong enough to stop the Sound Four if they went after the people closest to him, and the idea that they would continue to pose a threat to Konoha so long as Sasuke remained in the Village. Hell in the original canon it's stated that the Village's resources were stretched thin in the months following Orochimaru's assault during the Chunin Exams, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to attack or infiltration by outside forces. That fact was proven as much when Itachi and Kisame showed up, fought four Jonins, put Kakashi in a coma, and only left because they realized Naruto wasn't there. Even if the village does manage to ward off attacks by the Sound Four, the resources and manpower required to do so would be taking away from the rest of their defenses, leaving them even more open to attack. \n\nNot to mention that the Sound Four could play some serious mind games with Sasuke to get their point across. Even if they don't go after the rest of Team 7 directly, they could begin offing random civilians or shinobi and leaving clues at the crime scene indicating that they were the ones doing it, such as the curse mark's symbol written in blood on a wall or the floor nearby--and heavily implying that Naruto or Sakura or Kakashi could be next by choosing victims that resemble the other members of Team 7, or by altering the corpses so they posses their most easily recognizable features, such as carving Naruto's whisker markings into one of the victim's cheeks with a blade, giving a female victim a headband worn in the exact same way Sakura wears hers and dying her hair pink, or putting a mask on one of the corpses that covers the lower half of the victim's face and wrapping a strip of fabric around their head so that it covers their left eye, so that they look just like Kakashi. Actually, since the curse mark is made up of three tomoe, maybe they could just cut the heads off all three of the victims and arrange them in a pattern on the floor so that the blood stains and drag marks look like the curse mark symbol. They could set it up in a way that makes Sasuke more likely to be the first person to stumble across the crime scene by stalking him for a few days ahead of time to learn his routine, scouting out which areas Sasuke visits most frequently (preferably alone) and at what times, and then when the time comes for the actual killings they leave the bodies in those exact locations a little while before the time Sasuke usually arrives. This of course would also alert Sasuke to the fact that they're watching him constantly, which would make anyone paranoid, and it would further enforce the idea that no place is safe from the Sound Four. Here's another idea; before the murders begin, the Sound Four will just start off by leaving ominous shit on Sasuke's doorstep or window sill, like a dead fox with one of it's eyes ripped out that's been impaled by a cherry blossom branch, maybe with some instant ramen mixed into it's exposed guts where they spill out of it's abdomen and a bloodstained copy of Icha Icha paradise laying between it's front paws. Bonus points if a crow just happens to be picking at the remains when Sasuke sees it. Okay, the ominous warnings probably wouldn't be that elaborate right off the bat--maybe they'd start by placing a dead frog that's been stabbed with a kunai inside an empty cup of instant ramen and stuffing it in his mailbox, and then work their way up to the fox over several weeks of leaving increasingly disturbing shit laying around for Sasuke to find. \n\nOops, this took quite a macabre turn. Didn't mean to go on a psychological horror on you, I guess I just found myself getting inspired. But even if the mind games weren't quite as severe as those conjured by my own twisted imagination, I can imagine Sasuke would still get the memo that his teammates and the other villagers will never be even remotely safe until Orochimaru gets what he wants. Even if it's not an overwhelming all out attack like the assault that was launched during the Chunin Exams, these stealth based infiltration operations would be devastatingly effective at undermining any sense of security Sasuke feels within Konoha, and any faith he has that the village would be able to protect his teammates. As it stands he feels helpless to do anything about it, but if he were to train hard enough under Orochimaru, he might eventually become strong enough to kill the snake and eliminate the threat he poses to himself and Konoha altogether. Failure means losing his body and becoming a vessel for Orochimaru, but if he succeeds, the payoff would be incredible. Also, he'd have the strength necessary to kill his brother (who is coincidentally a member of the Akatsuki, meaning that he is a threat to Konoha and especially to Naruto) and avenge the death of his family. \n\nNow THAT would be a badass plot.",
