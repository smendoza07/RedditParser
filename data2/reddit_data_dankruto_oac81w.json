None of the characters or arcs in the series so far made me be like, dang, this is something I haven't seen before. \nThe movie was a bit better with tanjiros dream and rengokus.. moment... both giving me goosebumps, but u just haven't been able to truly care for a character the way u have in other shows. Don't get me wrong I love the series and their characters i just feel most of them have been very plane so far. They have like 2 characteristics which they just overuse sometimes. \n\nI still love it, especially the fights and the funnier moments sometimes work rly well. The series also looks fucking stunning and the movie was overall great. I just don't see the characters as walking masterpieces",

None of the characters or arcs in the series so far made me be like, dang, this is something I haven't seen before. \nThe movie was a bit better with tanjiros dream and rengokus.. moment... both giving me goosebumps, but u just haven't been able to truly care for a character the way u have in other shows. Don't get me wrong I love the series and their characters i just feel most of them have been very plane so far. They have like 2 characteristics which they just overuse sometimes. \n\nI still love it, especially the fights and the funnier moments sometimes work rly well. The series also looks fucking stunning and the movie was overall great. I just don't see the characters as walking masterpieces",

None of the characters or arcs in the series so far made me be like, dang, this is something I haven't seen before. \nThe movie was a bit better with tanjiros dream and rengokus.. moment... both giving me goosebumps, but u just haven't been able to truly care for a character the way u have in other shows. Don't get me wrong I love the series and their characters i just feel most of them have been very plane so far. They have like 2 characteristics which they just overuse sometimes. \n\nI still love it, especially the fights and the funnier moments sometimes work rly well. The series also looks fucking stunning and the movie was overall great. I just don't see the characters as walking masterpieces",

None of the characters or arcs in the series so far made me be like, dang, this is something I haven't seen before. \nThe movie was a bit better with tanjiros dream and rengokus.. moment... both giving me goosebumps, but u just haven't been able to truly care for a character the way u have in other shows. Don't get me wrong I love the series and their characters i just feel most of them have been very plane so far. They have like 2 characteristics which they just overuse sometimes. \n\nI still love it, especially the fights and the funnier moments sometimes work rly well. The series also looks fucking stunning and the movie was overall great. I just don't see the characters as walking masterpieces",

I know people don't think he was relevant and few people liked him as a character, but he was there to show the true \"dark\" side of the good guys. \n\nHe showed how the Covert-ops Ninjas operate and are more quick to deadly force and assassinations; this was the organization that basically created the internal confict in Itachi choosing the village over his own clan.\n\nHe was relevant enough to not be killed by the ol' Naruto's Lover.",
