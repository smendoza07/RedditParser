    "body": "So I ended up going out to meet the guy, but as I parked I heard air coming out of my tire. It had been punctured pretty badly so I figured I\u2019d run in and tell him since I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it to a shop with how quickly the air was coming out. He was really cool about it and came out with me, we kind of laughed it off together. \n\nI don\u2019t know how tf to put on a spare but I have all the stuff for it, and he said he knows how. I called my boyfriend to tell him what happened and that I think I can handle it. (Edit: realized I misspoke. Clarifying because there\u2019s confusion in the comments. Not sure if it makes a difference but I actually answered the call from my boyfriend because I\u2019d tried calling him before I went into the restaurant and he didn\u2019t answer. When I was walking out with POT, bf called back and I answered to tell him it\u2019s all good)\n\nBut as he started reaching for the tools he was like, \u201cyou know, actually I\u2019m just wondering why your boyfriend\u2019s not here. This is a domestic thing.\u201d \ud83d\ude02 and I was like no totally, you thought you were going to have a nice drink and dinner, not lay on the sidewalk and change a tire. Feel free to leave! \n\nSo he dipped. I took it as a sign that my tire saved me from a bad date, lol. Because after he left I never got a follow up text or anything to make sure I got it figured out! I\u2019m sure he must have sized me up and realized I\u2019m not his type so just ghosted, which is fair. But random men walking by stopped to ask if we need any help, but my date couldn\u2019t be bothered?! Haha\n\nHe was also really judgmental that I didn\u2019t drive straight to a shop and just call him instead of wasting time running inside. But the closest shop was a half mile away and it was rush hour and there was no way I\u2019d make it in time. He just made me feel stupid for that and I didn\u2019t really feel like I had space to explain my thought process. I hate being around people who make you feel dumb like that! \n\nAlso, I was just thinking if this happened on my first date with my boyfriend, or with my last SD, or with various friends I\u2019ve met online, most of them totally would have stuck around and it would turn into an impromptu car maintenance date. And those are the kinds of dudes I\u2019m looking for! \ud83d\ude02",

That said, I'll also note that it's one thing to know that your POT has a boyfriend, it's another that she calls him right in front of you after you've known her for 2 minutes and are about to change her tire.  For some guys, that could be a pretty shocking dose of reality, towards a woman in whom he's invested almost nothing, and the suspension of disbelief might be broken completely.  If he's less secure than he thought about you having a boyfriend, or relying on DADT, there might be no way back from this.  Perhaps that's dodging a bullet also.",

What actually happened is I answered a call from my boyfriend because I\u2019d called him before I went into the restaurant. But same thing. \n\nI guess I\u2019ve been non-monogamous for so long that it\u2019s normal for my date to answer calls/texts from their partners occasionally, openly talk about them, etc. for someone who isn\u2019t as used to that I can see how it would be surprising. Being okay with your SB having a boyfriend in theory vs actually seeing her communicate with him shouldn\u2019t make much of a difference for someone who is truly comfortable with that dynamic though.",

All of a sudden this guy may show up, while you are trying to pick up his girlfriend. Of course they girl would have claimed that he's ok with it, but who knows.",

I think that\u2019s why I really take my time finding an SD. Finding diamonds in the rough who don\u2019t have that alpha male mentality is next to impossible.

Let me have my moment of wanting him to check on me! Lol. Nah but honestly I didn\u2019t message him because him ditching the way he did put a bad taste in my mouth and I didn\u2019t really see it going anywhere anyway. Probably the same thing happened on his end and I don\u2019t blame him for that. Clearly it wasn\u2019t a match, might as well skip the formalities",

I'm pretty non-monogamous when it comes to this lifestyle, I mean - I get it. I do. But I have to say, aside from the two SB's I had at the same time that didn't know each other until they were with me separately? I'm not so sure I will extend much effort into an SR where she's already attached in a formal fashion.\n\nWhy? Inevitably _every single time_ I have dated someone in an open situation, it's ended hard. Usually if my SB has a BF, he goes down the Jealous Highway 101 every time and drama ensues.\n\nThe last one had a GF, and after almost three months in? GF wants more commitment, SB can't give it, then SB tells me later \"so sorry, I can't be a companion I'm too broken hearted.\" and not a peep since. \n\nSo nah. I learn they're otherwise committed I don't put much stock in it lasting for any great length of time. At least not after the last one. That one hurt.",

If I meet somebody who has rules like that in place it\u2019s a haaard pass.

What actually happened is I answered a call from my boyfriend because I\u2019d called him before I went into the restaurant. But same thing. \n\nI guess I\u2019ve been non-monogamous for so long that it\u2019s normal for my date to answer calls/texts from their partners occasionally, openly talk about them, etc. for someone who isn\u2019t as used to that I can see how it would be surprising. Being okay with your SB having a boyfriend in theory vs actually seeing her communicate with him shouldn\u2019t make much of a difference for someone who is truly comfortable with that dynamic though.",

I wouldn\u2019t do that in the middle of dinner for gods sake, but I JUST met the guy and JUST found out I had a flat tire and was figuring out how to solve a problem. Again, wtf? It\u2019s totally ridiculous to shame me for not taking care of this man\u2019s emotions before dealing with/acting on the situation at hand.\n\nEdit: also to call my boyfriend a suitcase pimp is so fucking stupid of you, I can\u2019t even. He\u2019s my life partner\u2026of four years\u2026. We live a 20 minute walk away from where I was meeting for the date. Obviously I would call him for help. Also, by calling him that you\u2019re insinuating I\u2019m an escort which, again what the fuck? What\u2019s your problem? Ever had a partner that you could lean on when problems arise in your life, dude?",

I didn\u2019t need his help, wasn\u2019t expecting it, wasn\u2019t mad that he left, didn\u2019t care about his money, and fixed the problem by myself without a problem.

Often as a way to scam money from you before meeting, or as an excuse not to show up.

All of a sudden this guy may show up, while you are trying to pick up his girlfriend. Of course they girl would have claimed that he's ok with it, but who knows.",

If your partner is imposing rules on you, it\u2019s because they\u2019re jealous/insecure and projecting that onto you. I have a big boundary in relationships that I won\u2019t let my partner or my partner\u2019s partner interfere in our relationship. If I meet somebody who has rules like that in place it\u2019s a haaard pass. Those are the sorts of questions you have to ask on a first date, or even before you meet, before getting emotionally involved. \n\nSomeone who is typically monogamous getting into all that might not have the language/knowledge/experience to know how to protect themselves and others, and set healthy boundaries",

But yeah, in the moment I did fantasize about hitting it off and having a funny first date story. I have a handful of friends/exes/previous SDs that totally would have helped and laughed it off together after. If you want to twist that into me being a terrible delusional woman somehow, go for it.

If your partner is imposing rules on you, it\u2019s because they\u2019re jealous/insecure and projecting that onto you. I have a big boundary in relationships that I won\u2019t let my partner or my partner\u2019s partner interfere in our relationship. If I meet somebody who has rules like that in place it\u2019s a haaard pass. Those are the sorts of questions you have to ask on a first date, or even before you meet, before getting emotionally involved. \n\nSomeone who is typically monogamous getting into all that might not have the language/knowledge/experience to know how to protect themselves and others, and set healthy boundaries",

He\u2019s my life partner\u2026of four years\u2026. We live a 20 minute walk away from where I was meeting for the date. Obviously I would call him for help.

I was thinking maybe my partner could come down and fix it and I could still make the date, maybe we could fix it together, maybe I should cancel, and it all happened within like 5 minutes. I wasn\u2019t being my most cool, calm and collected self. What I really should have done is just text him and tell him I can\u2019t make it so I wouldn\u2019t have had to mess with that whole drama.",
