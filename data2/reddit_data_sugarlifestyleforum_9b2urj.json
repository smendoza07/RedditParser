My ex was actually not conventionally attractive at all (very out of shape, not a conventionally attractive face, etc) but he became my best friend when I met him and the idea of making him feel good was arousing to me.  I found myself drawn to things about him in his own way (his eyes, his laugh, etc). \n\nOver the course of a couple of years his business boomed and he became extremely wealthy.  Still to this day people make the joke to me that there\u2019s no way I was with him for his looks... and it drives me insane.  I was absolutely attracted to him because of who he was to me.  \n\nJust wanted to add my 2 cents ",
