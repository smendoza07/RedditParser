If you were to have it buzzed for a longer period I\u2019m sure they would eventually say that your hair at any longer length doesn\u2019t look good on you. It looks fine on you as far as I can tell. Most importantly if you like it you should get a buzz cut once again!",

In my opinion the hair cut suits you, but the most important thing is that you feel comfortable and you like it. \n\nI dye my hair pink and black and sometimes it looks a bit mad, and some people react really negatively to me purely because of their own preconceived notions of what someone with dyed hair must be like, but I don't give a shit because I wanted pink and black hair as a child, now I'm an adult I can have it if I want.
