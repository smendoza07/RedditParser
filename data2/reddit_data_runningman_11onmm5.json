I just wanted to delete them off my device and thought they're way too good not to revisit. \n\nThis is one of my favorite moments in running man. We don't get nearly enough of their interactions, and I'm done complaining about that. I've accepted that that's just how it is. But, look at that woman turning into a small child when she makes a mess and has to call for big sister, knowing fully well she's gonna get a scolding. \n\nAlso, knowing SJH had a dog she loves so much, this is even cuter because the way she drags SoMin off to the side to clean her up is exactly how a dog mom does it: dragging by the leashe, then softly scolding her puppy as she cleans. \n\nI'm not calling anyone a dog. \ud83d\ude01 Just making that clear. Just something cute I noticed.",
