    "body": "Tl;dr classy move\n\nMet a young lady for an M&G this weekend; morning coffee at an upscale coffee house. She was a few minutes late, but charming and even more attractive than in her photos. I gave her a small wrapped gift and she looked surprised, very pleased, and gave me a hug. I planned on us getting our coffees and walking, but she wore boots with 4-inch stilettos so while she was initially up for a walk that didn't last too long. \n\nWe ended up sitting in my car and talking, which led to us holding hands, a little bit of kissing (but nothing more), and her asking me what I was doing for the rest of the day.\n\nI suggested she joined me at my place for dinner, and she agreed. (We had talked about a ppm before the M&G).\n\nWhen she showed up, she had with her a bakery box full of desserts. When I said \"you really didn't have to bring anything\" she replied \"but you bought the coffee.\"\n\nSugar is sweet.",
