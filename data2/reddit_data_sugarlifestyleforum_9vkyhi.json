    "body": "So just had a M&G with a girl from Brooklyn. She was cute and we have a lot in common. After we agreed to a meeting place in Midtown I mentioned it should be convenient to get to since it\u2019s near a main subway hub. \n\nShe then says something to the effect \u201cWait, what?! You\u2019re not going to send a car to pick me up?!\u201d  I guess I was a little surprised since the subway would be twice as fast as driving from BK to Manhattan. Whatever, I offered to cover her Uber costs. Then she says \u201cyou don\u2019t drive around in Manhattan? Is that preference or because you don\u2019t have it like that?\u201d  That comment annoyed me. I told her I Uber, subway, or walk depending on what\u2019s faster and more convenient. Only a dummy would take a ride across town during certain times of the day. \n\nAs you can imagine the M&G sucked. After giving her an envelope to more than cover her Uber costs, she opened it to see how much! Then tells me this would cover the transportation but not for her time. I would have walked out right then but was really enjoying my fish entree!\n\nShe then starts this diatribe about how she deserves to be spoiled and says in this spaced out way \u201cI\u2019m Shaya\u201d., like that changes anything. Yea I know who you are. So what?! \n\nOne of the weirdest M&G I\u2019ve had. Just wanted to share. \n\n",

Most of the time for me it\u2019s absolutely the quickest way from A to B over sitting in a car in Manhattan gridlock. Sometimes my SD likes getting me a car home when it\u2019s really late, which is always appreciated, but every M&G I\u2019ve taken public transport to, usually just requesting somewhere that\u2019s convenient to whatever line I need to take back.\n\nEven though the MTA can be annoying with all the delays (I\u2019ll see Andrew Cuomo in _hell_) I like that people from all socioeconomic strata take it, everyday. It\u2019s not just a \u201cpoor person\u201d thing? That comment would\u2019ve irked me too, were I an SD.",

The way she asked was awful but I don\u2019t think her asking for it in and of itself is that surprisingly. \n\n\nHey if you wanna get into a pissing contest with yourself over how dangerous the subway is for young women like myself and other SB\u2019s and how disgusting it is despite myself living here and getting desensitized to it, go right ahead. If you think it makes you cool that you\u2019re okay with how dirty and unkempt the subway is while it reeks of piss and some crazy homeless people...yikes ",

Almost all SB are appreciative when I suggest meeting someplace in the middle or close to them.  Many offer to meet close to me.  The divas are the ones who want everything to be about them and only care about themselves.   I spoil SB's that appreciate being spoiled, vs the diva SB that demands and insists to be spoiled when we have not even met yet.\n\nLet's keep this respectful.  We have a difference in opinion.  I am definitely not in the wrong place.  I assume you are successful sugaring.  So am I.   NYC has thousands of attractive SB's.  ",
