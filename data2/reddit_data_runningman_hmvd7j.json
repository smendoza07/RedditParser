It shows how Running Man can illustrate change over time in a way that only a variety show can.\n\nThe episode gave Haha the spotlight he deserved and was a fitting sendoff to his \"playboy\" character from earlier episodes, especially when they showed his proposal to Byul and told her \"please be my last love\" - a line that he had said to many guests over the first 100 episodes.",
