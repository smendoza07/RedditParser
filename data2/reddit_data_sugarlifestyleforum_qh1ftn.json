If the age of consent was raised, then they would be considered underage. No one is stopping 18/19 yr olds from having sex with each other, they are going to do it anyways. The point of these laws is to protect underage children from being influenced by older people who have the knowledge and skill set to potentially take advantage of them. Children are, for the most part, afraid of confronting older people as they are seen as authority figures. The issue is the power imbalance between a child and an adult. We are all stupid kids at 18/19 and we think we know it all until we look back and cringe. I once tried to date a 24yr old when I was 16 and god damn, do I cringe and Im so happy I didnt have sex with him bc now I see him for the predator he really was. Thank god I wasnt one of those child brides!",

Just bc a 14yr old girl is showing signs of an adult woman doesnt mean that mentally that 14yr old child has the mentally capacity to deal with what comes with being sexually active. There is a massive amount of life experiences missing from a 15yr old girl vs. a 50+ year man.\n\nI look at my own 14yr old sister and she is a child in my eyes. She still plays roblox and pokemon. All she wants to do is go to school, find a career, and play with her friends. Shes not even hinting signs that she has a crush on a classmate or anything. She does not have the mentally capacity to be sexually active nor is able to properly birth a baby when she is a child herself. She should live her childhood childfree jfc",

Most normies would say all SDs are \"creepy\" because they want to be with women much younger than they are. Most SDs who prefer 18-19 year olds would say pedophiles are \"creepy\". Most pedophiles would say infantofiles are \"creepy\".\n\nBasically it seems the goalposts for \"creepy\" move to the point where the person making the judgment is in the all clear, and people who do not share the same preferences are \"creepy\".\n\nBarely legal in the USA is not barely legal across all nations, cultures, nor histories. Also, an 18 year old who grew up too fast is far more interesting and mature than a 30 year old who was sheltered by her relatively affluent and generous upbringing.

My lifetime earnings will be less, my peak salary comes at an earlier age. And university is ridiculously overpriced. \n\nBeing an SB means I\u2019m taking control of my financial future and making up for that pay gap. More money never hurt anyone, I can invest it, buy property, or pay for a higher degree (Masters), which is what I\u2019m doing.\n\nMen get to make more money just because they\u2019re men. So if I can cash in because I\u2019m pretty and young-looking, damn right I\u2019m going to do it. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, at any age.\n\nAnd again, I\u2019ll close with, you\u2019re how old and on these sites? You\u2019re in no position to judge anyone.",

If the age of consent was raised, then they would be considered underage. No one is stopping 18/19 yr olds from having sex with each other, they are going to do it anyways. The point of these laws is to protect underage children from being influenced by older people who have the knowledge and skill set to potentially take advantage of them. Children are, for the most part, afraid of confronting older people as they are seen as authority figures. The issue is the power imbalance between a child and an adult. We are all stupid kids at 18/19 and we think we know it all until we look back and cringe. I once tried to date a 24yr old when I was 16 and god damn, do I cringe and Im so happy I didnt have sex with him bc now I see him for the predator he really was. Thank god I wasnt one of those child brides!",

Its creepy for a much older person to be with an 18/19 yr old. They have TEEN right there in their ages.\n\nThe laws can be changed and Im all for raising the ages. There are some political groups who would love to lower the age of consent. Im speaking of a hypothetical in which the age of consent is raised. That would become the new legal standards to which behaviors/actions would be applied to.",

If the age of consent was raised, then they would be considered underage. No one is stopping 18/19 yr olds from having sex with each other, they are going to do it anyways. The point of these laws is to protect underage children from being influenced by older people who have the knowledge and skill set to potentially take advantage of them. Children are, for the most part, afraid of confronting older people as they are seen as authority figures. The issue is the power imbalance between a child and an adult. We are all stupid kids at 18/19 and we think we know it all until we look back and cringe. I once tried to date a 24yr old when I was 16 and god damn, do I cringe and Im so happy I didnt have sex with him bc now I see him for the predator he really was. Thank god I wasnt one of those child brides!",

But let\u2019s say I am for whatever reason. It is so very evident when someone is underage, in looks and in speaking with them. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t randomly sexualize people. When I\u2019m out and about I don\u2019t look at people with the express intent to find them hot or not. I recognize people as generally attractive, sure. Not in an \u201cI want to bang them\u201d way, but just recognizing someone is conventionally attractive. Because there\u2019s something called *context*, which amazingly lets us know what is appropriate and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAs a side note, you may want to proofread your responses. In your first response to me, you\u2019ve used \u201cof\u201d when you meant \u201coff\u201d. In the second you say \u201cyour are\u201d instead of \u201cyou are\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d.

If the age of consent was raised, then they would be considered underage. No one is stopping 18/19 yr olds from having sex with each other, they are going to do it anyways. The point of these laws is to protect underage children from being influenced by older people who have the knowledge and skill set to potentially take advantage of them. Children are, for the most part, afraid of confronting older people as they are seen as authority figures. The issue is the power imbalance between a child and an adult. We are all stupid kids at 18/19 and we think we know it all until we look back and cringe. I once tried to date a 24yr old when I was 16 and god damn, do I cringe and Im so happy I didnt have sex with him bc now I see him for the predator he really was.

She does not have the mentally capacity to be sexually active nor is able to properly birth a baby when she is a child herself. She should live her childhood childfree jfc",

Not in an \u201cI want to bang them\u201d way, but just recognizing someone is conventionally attractive.

If the age of consent was raised, then they would be considered underage. No one is stopping 18/19 yr olds from having sex with each other, they are going to do it anyways. The point of these laws is to protect underage children from being influenced by older people who have the knowledge and skill set to potentially take advantage of them. Children are, for the most part, afraid of confronting older people as they are seen as authority figures. The issue is the power imbalance between a child and an adult. We are all stupid kids at 18/19 and we think we know it all until we look back and cringe. I once tried to date a 24yr old when I was 16 and god damn, do I cringe and Im so happy I didnt have sex with him bc now I see him for the predator he really was. Thank god I wasnt one of those child brides!",

            "body": "I literally explained how the law works dude. Under the current set of laws, 18/19 is not considered underage. If the age of consent was raised, then they would be considered underage. No one is stopping 18/19 yr olds from having sex with each other, they are going to do it anyways. The point of these laws is to protect underage children from being influenced by older people who have the knowledge and skill set to potentially take advantage of them. Children are, for the most part, afraid of confronting older people as they are seen as authority figures. The issue is the power imbalance between a child and an adult. We are all stupid kids at 18/19 and we think we know it all until we look back and cringe. I once tried to date a 24yr old when I was 16 and god damn, do I cringe and Im so happy I didnt have sex with him bc now I see him for the predator he really was. Thank god I wasnt one of those child brides!",
