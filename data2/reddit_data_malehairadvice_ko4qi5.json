If you can provide a name and a picture, it absolutely helps the barber to know what you're going after, especially if you have a different hair type that he needs to work around. Instead of just going \"uhh I dunno, I just saw this picture\" to every question the barber asks. With a name he can look up other pictures before going to the barber, get more info, and see if he likes it or maybe even tweak it a little.",
