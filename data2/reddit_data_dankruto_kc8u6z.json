Hashirama is in a league of his own. And the legendary sannin are a big fucking deal. As you can tell, orochimaru, tsunade and jiraiya have no match, their abilities are exceptional without having kekkei genkai or kekkei touta. Also Sasuke certainly could use sage mode. But why doesn't he? He trained under orochimaru I'm sure he could've used him to train with sage mode? Also why doesn't tsunade or orochimaru use sage mode? Kabuto learning sage mode I didn't like either. It was unnecessary and certainly should not have been possible for him in such state. Kishimoto took many liberties with the story which he most certainly can, but go ahead and watch the myouboku episodes again why can't everyone learn sage mode.",

Naruto lost his father and now he lost his master which was like a grandfather for him and he was depressed. What did Sakura do? She didn't even say she was sorry. And i don't remember Naruto making joke about uchiha being dead. Sakura was useless. When you show me 10 pictures of her being usefull that doesn't mean she usefull. That means the character is so useless that you can only show me 10 pictutes. She is one of the main characters but you acting likd she has same screen time with tenten. She haven't relasied any of her mistakes. She was piece of shit whole show and unlike Sasuke paying for his sins she got what she wanted. She married Sasuke. I mean i don't think you should be genius to understand that character is useless when she couldn't take an eye out and hesitated even though she was a master medical ninja.",

I think the show made it clear that Itachi only retreated because he was working as a spy for Konoha within Akatsuki, so obviously he wouldn\u2019t want to do an all-out fight against Jiraya. \n\nItachi and Kissame would have defeated Jiraya if they fought there, and that\u2019s why Itachi retreated.",

Hashirama is in a league of his own. And the legendary sannin are a big fucking deal. As you can tell, orochimaru, tsunade and jiraiya have no match, their abilities are exceptional without having kekkei genkai or kekkei touta. Also Sasuke certainly could use sage mode. But why doesn't he? He trained under orochimaru I'm sure he could've used him to train with sage mode? Also why doesn't tsunade or orochimaru use sage mode? Kabuto learning sage mode I didn't like either. It was unnecessary and certainly should not have been possible for him in such state. Kishimoto took many liberties with the story which he most certainly can, but go ahead and watch the myouboku episodes again why can't everyone learn sage mode.",

He was also obsessed with getting orochimaru\u2019s powers, so getting snake sage jutsu doesn\u2019t seem that unbelievable to me. \n\nSasuke is stronger than Hashirama, so I\u2019m not sure how Hashirama being \u201con a league of his own\u201d matters here. \n\n Anyways, Sasuke is always portrayed as a genius when it comes to chakra, so he should also be able to LEARN sage jutsu.

And i don't remember Naruto making joke about uchiha being dead. Sakura was useless. When you show me 10 pictures of her being usefull that doesn't mean she usefull. That means the character is so useless that you can only show me 10 pictutes. She is one of the main characters but you acting likd she has same screen time with tenten. She haven't relasied any of her mistakes. She was piece of shit whole show and unlike Sasuke paying for his sins she got what she wanted. She married Sasuke. I mean i don't think you should be genius to understand that character is useless when she couldn't take an eye out and hesitated even though she was a master medical ninja.",

Hashirama is in a league of his own. And the legendary sannin are a big fucking deal. As you can tell, orochimaru, tsunade and jiraiya have no match, their abilities are exceptional without having kekkei genkai or kekkei touta. Also Sasuke certainly could use sage mode. But why doesn't he? He trained under orochimaru I'm sure he could've used him to train with sage mode? Also why doesn't tsunade or orochimaru use sage mode? Kabuto learning sage mode I didn't like either. It was unnecessary and certainly should not have been possible for him in such state. Kishimoto took many liberties with the story which he most certainly can, but go ahead and watch the myouboku episodes again why can't everyone learn sage mode.",

And i don't remember Naruto making joke about uchiha being dead. Sakura was useless. When you show me 10 pictures of her being usefull that doesn't mean she usefull. That means the character is so useless that you can only show me 10 pictutes. She is one of the main characters but you acting likd she has same screen time with tenten. She haven't relasied any of her mistakes. She was piece of shit whole show and unlike Sasuke paying for his sins she got what she wanted. She married Sasuke.

As you can tell, orochimaru, tsunade and jiraiya have no match, their abilities are exceptional without having kekkei genkai or kekkei touta. Also Sasuke certainly could use sage mode. But why doesn't he? He trained under orochimaru I'm sure he could've used him to train with sage mode? Also why doesn't tsunade or orochimaru use sage mode? Kabuto learning sage mode I didn't like either. It was unnecessary and certainly should not have been possible for him in such state. Kishimoto took many liberties with the story which he most certainly can, but go ahead and watch the myouboku episodes again why can't everyone learn sage mode.",

I think Minato having sage mode is pretty laughable since why did he not use it during the Kurama invasion? \n\nKabuto acquiring sage made seems plausible to me, since he was shown to be talented with medical ninjutsu which requires a lot of precise chakra control. He was also obsessed with getting orochimaru\u2019s powers, so getting snake sage jutsu doesn\u2019t seem that unbelievable to me. \n\nSasuke is stronger than Hashirama, so I\u2019m not sure how Hashirama being \u201con a league of his own\u201d matters here. \n\n Anyways, Sasuke is always portrayed as a genius when it comes to chakra, so he should also be able to LEARN sage jutsu. I never said he already has it.",

And i don't remember Naruto making joke about uchiha being dead. Sakura was useless. When you show me 10 pictures of her being usefull that doesn't mean she usefull. That means the character is so useless that you can only show me 10 pictutes. She is one of the main characters but you acting likd she has same screen time with tenten. She haven't relasied any of her mistakes. She was piece of shit whole show and unlike Sasuke paying for his sins she got what she wanted. She married Sasuke.

Jiraiya was fucking powerful too bad we didn't get to really see how much. I'm sure if it wasn't for nagato who really had all the upper hands, jiraiya wouldn't go down that easily.

Naruto lost his father and now he lost his master which was like a grandfather for him and he was depressed. What did Sakura do? She didn't even say she was sorry. And i don't remember Naruto making joke about uchiha being dead. Sakura was useless. When you show me 10 pictures of her being usefull that doesn't mean she usefull. That means the character is so useless that you can only show me 10 pictutes. She is one of the main characters but you acting likd she has same screen time with tenten. She haven't relasied any of her mistakes. She was piece of shit whole show and unlike Sasuke paying for his sins she got what she wanted. She married Sasuke. I mean i don't think you should be genius to understand that character is useless when she couldn't take an eye out and hesitated even though she was a master medical ninja.",

I don\u2019t really consider naruto as my top anime or anything like that, and Sasuke is definitely not my favourite character even from naruto characters, so you are entirely wrong in that front. \n\nYou started this whole argument about Sasuke not being able to learn sage jutsu and only Jiraya has ever been able to do so, and that\u2019s how this whole conversation started. Just cuz he has a shitty personality doesn\u2019t mean he cannot learn sage mode lol.",
