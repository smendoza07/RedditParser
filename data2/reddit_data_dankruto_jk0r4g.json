There's like 14 years of real time sitting there with Checkov's gun pointed at a question mark like \"who's it gonna be\"; the trigger growing heavy with time. And then the answer is nobody. Nobody dies from popping open the 8th gate. Checkov's gun just gets unloaded and thrown in the garbage.",

The one good thing Boruto does consistently over Naruto is character development for both main and side characters. They focus on the whole squad, not just Team 7, and their actions and interactions feel all-around more realistic. The overarching plot also looks good but the execution is a bit lacking.\n\nFights just make you pull your hair out for how stupid some characters' strategy is (like, they know Isshiki shrinks anything chakra based, but that ain't gonna stop Sasuke or Naruto from throwing the seventh Chidori/Rasengan at him just to get shrunk again and again and waste chakra smh).\n\nThe panels in the last chapters were kinda wasted on re-explaining again things that were already previously explained. This and watching Amado smoke the 997th cigarette. Given the wait is a whole month, not weekly as it was with Naruto, and how the art is also more simplified in Boruto, people feel like waiting a whole month for this isn't really justified.",

Senju chakra + Uchicha chakra + 9 beasts = Rikudou Sennin chakra\n\n2.'Rikudou chakra + ged\u014d statue = Kaguya's chakra \n\nHagoromo explains this during 4th ninja war. Madara had Hashirama's cells transplanted into his body. This gave him a power boost and that's actually when Rinnegan emerges - when EMS user receives chakra of Hagoromo or mixes Indra and Asura chakras. Madara managed to do the latter almost by accident, while just trying to steal Hashirama's powers like mokuton or sennin mod\u014d. When Madara also absorbed chakra of 9 beasts, his chakra became a full-ass Hagoromo chakra, which allowed Rikudou sennin to reappear as a ghost (episode around 421). Only then Madara (or his higher body half) absorbed Ged\u014d statue, becoming vessel for not Hagoromo, but Kaguya.\n\nBack to the Boruto thing - if Sasuke gets a new arm, he's reproducing Madara's process and becomes new almost-Hagoromo, which bears a lot of risks, as you're one step closer to becoming new Kaguya vessel. 'Only' tailed beasts and Ged\u014d remain to reproduce of what happened during 4th ninja war. Also - having Rinnegan means being able to summon Ged\u014d in the first place, so double the fun.",

Now not only does Sasuke not have 8.5 tailed beasts to power him up with, Naruto has the full 9 tails, AND Sasuke is missing an arm. Sasuke is full tiers below Naruto and is strictly weaker. \n  \nAND Part 2: Naruto also got Hashirama cells on top of all of that.",

Sasuke gets his gift from the sage which gives him rinnegan. Naruto gets upgraded cloak mode,  chakra from all 9 beasts, AND specifically a chakra upgrade from the sage... Then somehow Sasuke is keeping up with Naruto in both speed and massive chakra blasts.",

So many factors show you are wrong. \n\nAnd you didn't show me anything about Kishimoto saying they were equal. And he also has said things his own works disprove so. Even if he did...he'd have to give a good reason why. I'm not saying Sasuke isn't close. Hell even as an adult before this new power up of Naruto's he may HAVE been equal. As an adult. And only because Naruto slacked off in training. Honestly I believe if Naruto kept training with the same ferver he used to and did after the war but before the Last, I think he'd be waaaay above Sasuke. \n\nAnd might actually be able to slightly hold off on Isshiki. That's my opinion tho, I don't state it as fact. It's just a theory. A NARUTO THEORY.",

He only had half of Kurama. He has ALL now. \nC. Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. Which we know he was holding back. Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right. And not cuz she's marrying me. Cuz trust me we've had some hella debates over wether or not Naruto would trash God mode Madara. \nYou just are whiney and can't pull out feats. I just did.

The only reason he even was able to do so in the fight with sasuke was because sasuke was overconfident and let him. Why wouldn't he have done that against jigen if he could?\n2. Cop out again\n3. Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more.

I mean fuck that whole ashura indra yin yang plot of naruto, what the fuck does it even matter all you gotta say is naruto is stronger you get the upvotes. Still though I wonder why naruto always ends up getting beaten worse than sasuke when it comes to Isshiki. Boy got beaten so bad he was missing from a whole chapter while sasuke fought him. Also pretending like this isn't a sacrifice move from naruto and that he's natrually this strong good job.",

If you want to talk about rasengan vs chidori I think we have conclusive proof at the end of naruto part 1\n3. Stfu with your fucking bullshit. Do you not remember one single thing from Naruto's sage mode training? How Pa kept bashing him over the head to keep him from absorbing too much. It was never fucking stated that Naruto's own chakra was stopping him from turning into a frog. Where the fuck did you get that from? They only said his chakra levels were high enough to be able to handle sage mode safely.\n4. Eat multi shadow clone cocks bitch and shove your attitude up your ass you lying trash",

The one good thing Boruto does consistently over Naruto is character development for both main and side characters. They focus on the whole squad, not just Team 7, and their actions and interactions feel all-around more realistic. The overarching plot also looks good but the execution is a bit lacking.\n\nFights just make you pull your hair out for how stupid some characters' strategy is (like, they know Isshiki shrinks anything chakra based, but that ain't gonna stop Sasuke or Naruto from throwing the seventh Chidori/Rasengan at him just to get shrunk again and again and waste chakra smh).\n\nThe panels in the last chapters were kinda wasted on re-explaining again things that were already previously explained. This and watching Amado smoke the 997th cigarette. Given the wait is a whole month, not weekly as it was with Naruto, and how the art is also more simplified in Boruto, people feel like waiting a whole month for this isn't really justified.",

Senju chakra + Uchicha chakra + 9 beasts = Rikudou Sennin chakra\n\n2.'Rikudou chakra + ged\u014d statue = Kaguya's chakra \n\nHagoromo explains this during 4th ninja war. Madara had Hashirama's cells transplanted into his body. This gave him a power boost and that's actually when Rinnegan emerges - when EMS user receives chakra of Hagoromo or mixes Indra and Asura chakras. Madara managed to do the latter almost by accident, while just trying to steal Hashirama's powers like mokuton or sennin mod\u014d. When Madara also absorbed chakra of 9 beasts, his chakra became a full-ass Hagoromo chakra, which allowed Rikudou sennin to reappear as a ghost (episode around 421). Only then Madara (or his higher body half) absorbed Ged\u014d statue, becoming vessel for not Hagoromo, but Kaguya.\n\nBack to the Boruto thing - if Sasuke gets a new arm, he's reproducing Madara's process and becomes new almost-Hagoromo, which bears a lot of risks, as you're one step closer to becoming new Kaguya vessel. 'Only' tailed beasts and Ged\u014d remain to reproduce of what happened during 4th ninja war. Also - having Rinnegan means being able to summon Ged\u014d in the first place, so double the fun.",

Sasuke gets his gift from the sage which gives him rinnegan. Naruto gets upgraded cloak mode,  chakra from all 9 beasts, AND specifically a chakra upgrade from the sage...

So many factors show you are wrong. \n\nAnd you didn't show me anything about Kishimoto saying they were equal. And he also has said things his own works disprove so. Even if he did...he'd have to give a good reason why. I'm not saying Sasuke isn't close. Hell even as an adult before this new power up of Naruto's he may HAVE been equal. As an adult. And only because Naruto slacked off in training. Honestly I believe if Naruto kept training with the same ferver he used to and did after the war but before the Last, I think he'd be waaaay above Sasuke. \n\nAnd might actually be able to slightly hold off on Isshiki. That's my opinion tho, I don't state it as fact. It's just a theory. A NARUTO THEORY.",

He only had half of Kurama. He has ALL now. \nC. Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. Which we know he was holding back. Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right.

Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child.

If you want to talk about rasengan vs chidori I think we have conclusive proof at the end of naruto part 1\n3. Stfu with your fucking bullshit. Do you not remember one single thing from Naruto's sage mode training? How Pa kept bashing him over the head to keep him from absorbing too much. It was never fucking stated that Naruto's own chakra was stopping him from turning into a frog. Where the fuck did you get that from? They only said his chakra levels were high enough to be able to handle sage mode safely.\n4. Eat multi shadow clone cocks bitch and shove your attitude up your ass you lying trash",

The one good thing Boruto does consistently over Naruto is character development for both main and side characters. They focus on the whole squad, not just Team 7, and their actions and interactions feel all-around more realistic. The overarching plot also looks good but the execution is a bit lacking.\n\nFights just make you pull your hair out for how stupid some characters' strategy is (like, they know Isshiki shrinks anything chakra based, but that ain't gonna stop Sasuke or Naruto from throwing the seventh Chidori/Rasengan at him just to get shrunk again and again and waste chakra smh).\n\nThe panels in the last chapters were kinda wasted on re-explaining again things that were already previously explained. This and watching Amado smoke the 997th cigarette. Given the wait is a whole month, not weekly as it was with Naruto, and how the art is also more simplified in Boruto, people feel like waiting a whole month for this isn't really justified.",

Senju chakra + Uchicha chakra + 9 beasts = Rikudou Sennin chakra\n\n2.'Rikudou chakra + ged\u014d statue = Kaguya's chakra \n\nHagoromo explains this during 4th ninja war. Madara had Hashirama's cells transplanted into his body. This gave him a power boost and that's actually when Rinnegan emerges - when EMS user receives chakra of Hagoromo or mixes Indra and Asura chakras. Madara managed to do the latter almost by accident, while just trying to steal Hashirama's powers like mokuton or sennin mod\u014d. When Madara also absorbed chakra of 9 beasts, his chakra became a full-ass Hagoromo chakra, which allowed Rikudou sennin to reappear as a ghost (episode around 421). Only then Madara (or his higher body half) absorbed Ged\u014d statue, becoming vessel for not Hagoromo, but Kaguya.\n\nBack to the Boruto thing - if Sasuke gets a new arm, he's reproducing Madara's process and becomes new almost-Hagoromo, which bears a lot of risks, as you're one step closer to becoming new Kaguya vessel. 'Only' tailed beasts and Ged\u014d remain to reproduce of what happened during 4th ninja war. Also - having Rinnegan means being able to summon Ged\u014d in the first place, so double the fun.",

And the Animal Path is useless.\n\nEach Rinnegan is unique, comparing Sasuke's Rinnegan to Pain's is a waste of time. Madara can create corporal shadows in the Limbo World,  Momoshiki is able to absorb any ninjutsu with his right Rinnegan and subsequently release it in an amplified form from his left Rinnegan, as well as transform chakra and living individuals into edibles, when his Rinnegan glow blue, Urashiki can displace himself and transport himself into the past to redo events.

So many factors show you are wrong. \n\nAnd you didn't show me anything about Kishimoto saying they were equal. And he also has said things his own works disprove so. Even if he did...he'd have to give a good reason why. I'm not saying Sasuke isn't close. Hell even as an adult before this new power up of Naruto's he may HAVE been equal. As an adult. And only because Naruto slacked off in training. Honestly I believe if Naruto kept training with the same ferver he used to and did after the war but before the Last, I think he'd be waaaay above Sasuke. \n\nAnd might actually be able to slightly hold off on Isshiki. That's my opinion tho, I don't state it as fact. It's just a theory. A NARUTO THEORY.",

Kurama was asleep after he gave naruto the last iota of his power. They are equal and in Boruto sasuke is perhaps even stronger. At least Isshiki thinks Sasuke is the bigger threat.\n4.

The fight...in the final valley has been so scrutinized and shown to be on naruto's side. \nA. He didn't have to draw power from ALL the Other Beast plust the other half of Kurama. \nB. He only had half of Kurama. He has ALL now. \nC. Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. Which we know he was holding back. Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right. And not cuz she's marrying me. Cuz trust me we've had some hella debates over wether or not Naruto would trash God mode Madara. \nYou just are whiney and can't pull out feats. I just did.

Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

Yeah ..that's naruto's power that he ALWAYS has...\n5. Wrong hahahaha. Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child.

If you want to talk about rasengan vs chidori I think we have conclusive proof at the end of naruto part 1\n3. Stfu with your fucking bullshit. Do you not remember one single thing from Naruto's sage mode training? How Pa kept bashing him over the head to keep him from absorbing too much. It was never fucking stated that Naruto's own chakra was stopping him from turning into a frog. Where the fuck did you get that from? They only said his chakra levels were high enough to be able to handle sage mode safely.\n4. Eat multi shadow clone cocks bitch and shove your attitude up your ass you lying trash",

The one good thing Boruto does consistently over Naruto is character development for both main and side characters. They focus on the whole squad, not just Team 7, and their actions and interactions feel all-around more realistic. The overarching plot also looks good but the execution is a bit lacking.\n\nFights just make you pull your hair out for how stupid some characters' strategy is (like, they know Isshiki shrinks anything chakra based, but that ain't gonna stop Sasuke or Naruto from throwing the seventh Chidori/Rasengan at him just to get shrunk again and again and waste chakra smh).\n\nThe panels in the last chapters were kinda wasted on re-explaining again things that were already previously explained. This and watching Amado smoke the 997th cigarette. Given the wait is a whole month, not weekly as it was with Naruto, and how the art is also more simplified in Boruto, people feel like waiting a whole month for this isn't really justified.",

Senju chakra + Uchicha chakra + 9 beasts = Rikudou Sennin chakra\n\n2.'Rikudou chakra + ged\u014d statue = Kaguya's chakra \n\nHagoromo explains this during 4th ninja war. Madara had Hashirama's cells transplanted into his body. This gave him a power boost and that's actually when Rinnegan emerges - when EMS user receives chakra of Hagoromo or mixes Indra and Asura chakras. Madara managed to do the latter almost by accident, while just trying to steal Hashirama's powers like mokuton or sennin mod\u014d. When Madara also absorbed chakra of 9 beasts, his chakra became a full-ass Hagoromo chakra, which allowed Rikudou sennin to reappear as a ghost (episode around 421). Only then Madara (or his higher body half) absorbed Ged\u014d statue, becoming vessel for not Hagoromo, but Kaguya.\n\nBack to the Boruto thing - if Sasuke gets a new arm, he's reproducing Madara's process and becomes new almost-Hagoromo, which bears a lot of risks, as you're one step closer to becoming new Kaguya vessel. 'Only' tailed beasts and Ged\u014d remain to reproduce of what happened during 4th ninja war. Also - having Rinnegan means being able to summon Ged\u014d in the first place, so double the fun.",

Madara can create corporal shadows in the Limbo World,  Momoshiki is able to absorb any ninjutsu with his right Rinnegan and subsequently release it in an amplified form from his left Rinnegan, as well as transform chakra and living individuals into edibles, when his Rinnegan glow blue, Urashiki can displace himself and transport himself into the past to redo events.

So many factors show you are wrong. \n\nAnd you didn't show me anything about Kishimoto saying they were equal. And he also has said things his own works disprove so. Even if he did...he'd have to give a good reason why. I'm not saying Sasuke isn't close. Hell even as an adult before this new power up of Naruto's he may HAVE been equal. As an adult. And only because Naruto slacked off in training. Honestly I believe if Naruto kept training with the same ferver he used to and did after the war but before the Last, I think he'd be waaaay above Sasuke. \n\nAnd might actually be able to slightly hold off on Isshiki. That's my opinion tho, I don't state it as fact. It's just a theory. A NARUTO THEORY.",

Kurama was asleep after he gave naruto the last iota of his power. They are equal and in Boruto sasuke is perhaps even stronger. At least Isshiki thinks Sasuke is the bigger threat.\n4.

He only had half of Kurama. He has ALL now. \nC. Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. Which we know he was holding back. Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right.

Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

Also pretending like this isn't a sacrifice move from naruto and that he's natrually this strong good job.",

Naruto literally borrowed kuramas power to use in that rasengan. Kurama went to sleep right after giving naruto all his remianing remaining chakra. Sasuke was using his own power. If you want to talk about rasengan vs chidori I think we have conclusive proof at the end of naruto part 1\n3. Stfu with your fucking bullshit. Do you not remember one single thing from Naruto's sage mode training? How Pa kept bashing him over the head to keep him from absorbing too much. It was never fucking stated that Naruto's own chakra was stopping him from turning into a frog. Where the fuck did you get that from? They only said his chakra levels were high enough to be able to handle sage mode safely.\n4. Eat multi shadow clone cocks bitch and shove your attitude up your ass you lying trash",

There's like 14 years of real time sitting there with Checkov's gun pointed at a question mark like \"who's it gonna be\"; the trigger growing heavy with time. And then the answer is nobody. Nobody dies from popping open the 8th gate. Checkov's gun just gets unloaded and thrown in the garbage.",

The one good thing Boruto does consistently over Naruto is character development for both main and side characters. They focus on the whole squad, not just Team 7, and their actions and interactions feel all-around more realistic. The overarching plot also looks good but the execution is a bit lacking.\n\nFights just make you pull your hair out for how stupid some characters' strategy is (like, they know Isshiki shrinks anything chakra based, but that ain't gonna stop Sasuke or Naruto from throwing the seventh Chidori/Rasengan at him just to get shrunk again and again and waste chakra smh).\n\nThe panels in the last chapters were kinda wasted on re-explaining again things that were already previously explained. This and watching Amado smoke the 997th cigarette. Given the wait is a whole month, not weekly as it was with Naruto, and how the art is also more simplified in Boruto, people feel like waiting a whole month for this isn't really justified.",

And the Animal Path is useless.\n\nEach Rinnegan is unique, comparing Sasuke's Rinnegan to Pain's is a waste of time. Madara can create corporal shadows in the Limbo World,  Momoshiki is able to absorb any ninjutsu with his right Rinnegan and subsequently release it in an amplified form from his left Rinnegan, as well as transform chakra and living individuals into edibles, when his Rinnegan glow blue, Urashiki can displace himself and transport himself into the past to redo events.  Sasuke's Rinnegan allows him to shift spaces within a certain range of himself.",

Even if he did...he'd have to give a good reason why. I'm not saying Sasuke isn't close. Hell even as an adult before this new power up of Naruto's he may HAVE been equal. As an adult. And only because Naruto slacked off in training. Honestly I believe if Naruto kept training with the same ferver he used to and did after the war but before the Last, I think he'd be waaaay above Sasuke. \n\nAnd might actually be able to slightly hold off on Isshiki.

Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right.

The only reason he even was able to do so in the fight with sasuke was because sasuke was overconfident and let him. Why wouldn't he have done that against jigen if he could?\n2. Cop out again\n3. Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

I actually fucking answered it. \n3. Also not a cop out since the rest of the answer was in letters...so this is you just padding numbers. \n4. Yeah ..that's naruto's power that he ALWAYS has...\n5. Wrong hahahaha. Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child. Not knowing physics and saying a whiny autist when you DON'T know me. I worked hard to get where I am and I did it without whining like a child who thinks Sasuke is a God.",

Naruto and Sasuke were both brought back to 100% by the sage. Did you even read a word I typed out before?\n3. Their fight ended in a draw. Facts don't care about your feelings. Kurama was asleep after he gave naruto the last iota of his power. They are equal and in Boruto sasuke is perhaps even stronger. At least Isshiki thinks Sasuke is the bigger threat.\n4. This is not a new kurama power up. It's his version of the 8th gate.",

The fight...in the final valley has been so scrutinized and shown to be on naruto's side. \nA. He didn't have to draw power from ALL the Other Beast plust the other half of Kurama. \nB. He only had half of Kurama. He has ALL now. \nC. Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. Which we know he was holding back. Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right. And not cuz she's marrying me. Cuz trust me we've had some hella debates over wether or not Naruto would trash God mode Madara. \nYou just are whiney and can't pull out feats. I just did. Like before to combat yours. What say you now? Please go ahead. I can debate a lot and I got more.",

The only reason he even was able to do so in the fight with sasuke was because sasuke was overconfident and let him. Why wouldn't he have done that against jigen if he could?\n2. Cop out again\n3. Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

Wrong hahahaha. Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child.

He only had half of Kurama. He has ALL now. \nC. Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke. Which we know he was holding back. Which of you know ANYTHING about fighting, that allows blows to actually do damage and wear you down even more. \nD. The final attack Sasuke was going DOWN at terminal velocity, with his most powerful chidori while Naruto was going UP with a basic rasengan. \nE. You have ZERO feats to show Sasuke is more powerful in boruto. And even Sasuke denies this when talking to Boruto. \nF. Eight gates is a power up ya dumbass. \nG. Isshiki is prolly more worried about Sasuke for the eye and teleportation issues. Isshiki is also more worried about Boruto but I don't see you saying Boruto is stronger. \nH. It isn't my feelings lmao. I'm autistic. If you know any Autistics we tend to be blunt and not care about feelings. \nG. I'm getting married to an Uchiha fanatic who legit says I'm right. And not cuz she's marrying me. Cuz trust me we've had some hella debates over wether or not Naruto would trash God mode Madara. \nYou just are whiney and can't pull out feats. I just did. Like before to combat yours. What say you now? Please go ahead. I can debate a lot and I got more.",

The only reason he even was able to do so in the fight with sasuke was because sasuke was overconfident and let him. Why wouldn't he have done that against jigen if he could?\n2. Cop out again\n3. Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro. We saw how the fight ended at their absolutes best. Peace out.",

I actually fucking answered it. \n3. Also not a cop out since the rest of the answer was in letters...so this is you just padding numbers. \n4. Yeah ..that's naruto's power that he ALWAYS has...\n5. Wrong hahahaha. Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child.

Keep these cop outs to yourself please\n4. Just like naruto got butt loads of sage chakra from kurama which has been shown to be incredibly potent.\n5. Naruto wasn't trying to kill sasuke DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT. Doesn't mean he wasn't teying to win. When has Naruto ever faced an opponent with the intention to kill with the exception of Orochimaru and when he lost control against pain? He was literally OUT OF CHAKRA at the end of the battle.\n6. Terminal velocity from a 2 story fall which they met halfway? Don't make me laugh \n7. Sasuke has been humbled since his fight. I never stated that he IS steonger just that Isshiki sees him as a bugger threat than naruto. Also Isshiki doesn't see boruto as a threat at all. He just wants to use him to nourish the god tree\n8. A very whiny autist I'm supposing. Nothing at all to support your feats but terminal velocity and sasuke can't do this or that anymore. Not a very compelling argument at all. Anyways keep at it bro.

Wrong hahahaha. Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child.

I actually fucking answered it. \n3. Also not a cop out since the rest of the answer was in letters...so this is you just padding numbers. \n4. Yeah ..that's naruto's power that he ALWAYS has...\n5. Wrong hahahaha. Sasuke even tells him he isn't going all out and it pisses him off. Go re-read that shit bruh. Naruto was fighting for far longer against three GOD level opponents. Sasuke...fought against ONE fully, ONE with help after Naruto and the others weakened. And was absent for a lot of Kaguya. \n6. If you think the statues are only two stories I'm done. Go back to school. Unless you're a kid. I am a bioengineer kid. It takes more force to jump up to meet, and to push down. You can hit terminal easily when you push down towards gravity. \n7. Boruto scared isshiki for a second in the second to last chapter. \n8. I supported my feats by mentioning what Sasuke had done(feats) in the final battle. And yeah it matters what he can't do. Because Naruto can do literally everything he could then plus more. Sasuke has worked up his rennigan, and I'll give him that but it still runs out too fast. \n\nThis is the last time I'm responding cuz you're obviously a child. Not knowing physics and saying a whiny autist when you DON'T know me. I worked hard to get where I am and I did it without whining like a child who thinks Sasuke is a God.",
