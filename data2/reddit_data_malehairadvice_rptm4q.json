At least use some product to add texture, thickness, or even possibly wave. Mullets look best with a stronger hairline, but best with thicker and curlier/wavier hair. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t pull it off with fine straight hair but you just don\u2019t have any of the right pieces to pull off this puzzle. No hate man! My hair is a mess right now too!",
