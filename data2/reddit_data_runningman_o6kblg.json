    "body": "LKS is a variety monster. We all know that. He's been blessed by the variety gods and gives 110% every time. He's got impeccable timing and unnaturally bad luck, scripted or not. His presence dominates the show and thus he ends up getting most of the screen time.\n\nHowever, that is also a problem in itself. He dominated the screen time. He gets the punishment many times because he puts himself in that position for entertainment's sake. In a show that was crowded enough with 8 members, LKS was a mainstay in screen time consistency. Now that he's gone, there's gonna be a lot of \"it's not the same without LKS\" and \"how can the show survive without LKS?\" Yes, absolutely it's different now. But I'd say it's a disservice to the other members if we all get hung up about the show losing its mojo without LKS.\n\nHis absence now allows for completely new dynamics. Bringing in JSM and YSC refreshed some stuff but the show's crew dynamic was still fairly consistent because LKS was one of the central pillars of the show. Other members will now be able to flourish even more and step their game up. We got a brief glimpse of this when he was out during his recovery. This was also mentioned in the latest episode, him being gone means SBS doesn't need to pay him. This allows for RM to have a bigger budget unless SBS decides to just withhold that money.\n\nLKS's absence will be felt for a long time but the crew and the show will have a new dynamic that will let them flourish even more.",

Not in your face or over the top funny but a very unique way of funny. Doesn't come often but when it does, he has you laughing out loud \n\nLKS in my opinion isn't a unique character. Can could easily be replaced. I mean since, Si Chan has come in he already lost the Maknae role and just get bullied by Jae Suk mainly. His traitor role is overplayed and you can see it in the other members faces when he does it too much. \n\nI'm looking forward to the new look of Running man.

For the past few episodes the noticeable awkwardness between him and JSM is really hard to watch. After people here in reddit started to notice it, I always anticipate their interactions every new weekly episode and hoping that it will improve. In his last few episodes their interaction was literally near zero. I'm a fan of the show and all of the members but I hate to see them giving their all to make us laugh while I think their could be some kind of beef going on between the members. Dont get me wrong I don't hate him or anything but him leaving was also a career move for him. Recently he won best supporting actor If I remember correctly and this might be his stepping stone for more serious/big roles and only hoping the best for him in the future. 11 years and 559 episodes is already enough content for an actor who works at a comedy variety show. \n\nHoping in the future fans won't bug him that he should return if his \"ankles\" will get better. Cannot believe so many people are really naive that he is hurt while YJS rides his back and the members never once mentioned  his injured \"ankles\".",

He did his job extremely well, but even the most devoted employees would eventually choose to follow their own path. \n\nAlthough they joke, it has never not been apparent just how much LKS loves acting. He has never picked any variety shows except RM and Busted (And I suspect his involvement with Busted was a combination of YJS's presence and Netflix money). He constantly picks challenging roles and experimental projects. In spite of his ambitions, he still remained steadfast with the RM cast and crew for eleven whole years, internal issues notwithstanding.

He has repeatedly mentioned that he loves acting. He is good enough to keep getting prominent roles and that is success in itself no? \n\nNot gonna downvote but it is a little presumptuous to measure success based on popularity. Oh Jung Se, supporting actor in Its okay to not be okay, got all the accolades and the public love. The baeksang best actor award wasn't given to Song Joongki for Vincenzo. Despite both Vincenzo and Joongki's popularity, the award was given to Shin Ha-Kyun of Beyond Evil, an almost 50 year old seasoned actor. Even outside of Korea, Parasite is unarguably the most popular Korean film, and you can't really attribute the success of the standout actors like Song Kang Ho and Lee Jeong-Eun to their appearance. \n\nPoint is Kwangsoo does not need to be popular he only need to be a good actor attached to interesting highbudget projects. He is popular enough to get those projects. You never know, he could star, maybe even as a supporting role, in a film as big as Parasite. He wants to pick projects that could challenge him to be characters beyond the Girin character he created for RM. And how can you blame the guy for not wanted to be pigeonholed in a single role for the rest of his life.",

I truly believe the PD will not push him to return if he's not 100%. And it's nearly 1.5 to 2 years too.\n\nI respect his decision whatever the reasons. He has given his all, 110%.

Some people might enjoy it but as someone who loves the old format of the show I do not enjoy Sechan. He might create a new dynamic but I do not like that new dynamic.\n\nAll I wanted was for the show to go back to its old format of episodes with the addition of Somin only and Bo Oil actually did it. Bo Pil PDs games remind me of the old episodes.\n\nBut the thing that other members were not receiving screentime when Lee Kwang Soo was there is simply wrong. \n\nAnd this new thing that Sechan will replace Lee Kwang Soo I don't like it. I want the focus to be on more older members and keep the format that way rather than moulding the format of the show to feature more of Yang Sechan.",

His traitor role is overplayed and you can see it in the other members faces when he does it too much. \n\nI'm looking forward to the new look of Running man.

He did his job extremely well, but even the most devoted employees would eventually choose to follow their own path. \n\nAlthough they joke, it has never not been apparent just how much LKS loves acting. He has never picked any variety shows except RM and Busted (And I suspect his involvement with Busted was a combination of YJS's presence and Netflix money). He constantly picks challenging roles and experimental projects. In spite of his ambitions, he still remained steadfast with the RM cast and crew for eleven whole years, internal issues notwithstanding.

He has repeatedly mentioned that he loves acting.

Oh Jung Se, supporting actor in Its okay to not be okay, got all the accolades and the public love. The baeksang best actor award wasn't given to Song Joongki for Vincenzo. Despite both Vincenzo and Joongki's popularity, the award was given to Shin Ha-Kyun of Beyond Evil, an almost 50 year old seasoned actor. Even outside of Korea, Parasite is unarguably the most popular Korean film, and you can't really attribute the success of the standout actors like Song Kang Ho and Lee Jeong-Eun to their appearance. \n\nPoint is Kwangsoo does not need to be popular he only need to be a good actor attached to interesting highbudget projects. He is popular enough to get those projects. You never know, he could star, maybe even as a supporting role, in a film as big as Parasite. He wants to pick projects that could challenge him to be characters beyond the Girin character he created for RM. And how can you blame the guy for not wanted to be pigeonholed in a single role for the rest of his life.",

I don\u2019t foresee him being a lead actor due to a celebrities popularity in acting being based on looks. I mean when I think of Kang Ha Neul, Song Joong Ki, Lee Dong Wook, Hyun Bin, I don\u2019t see Kwang Soo mentally in these guys\u2019s tier. Do supporting actors get the same recognition? Idk. Runningman is popular overseas but not in Korea so it\u2019s even harder for him to get recognition because no ones going to watch a drama JUST because Kwangsoo is in it.",

He has repeatedly mentioned that he loves acting. He is good enough to keep getting prominent roles and that is success in itself no? \n\nNot gonna downvote but it is a little presumptuous to measure success based on popularity. Oh Jung Se, supporting actor in Its okay to not be okay, got all the accolades and the public love. The baeksang best actor award wasn't given to Song Joongki for Vincenzo. Despite both Vincenzo and Joongki's popularity, the award was given to Shin Ha-Kyun of Beyond Evil, an almost 50 year old seasoned actor. Even outside of Korea, Parasite is unarguably the most popular Korean film, and you can't really attribute the success of the standout actors like Song Kang Ho and Lee Jeong-Eun to their appearance. \n\nPoint is Kwangsoo does not need to be popular he only need to be a good actor attached to interesting highbudget projects. He is popular enough to get those projects. You never know, he could star, maybe even as a supporting role, in a film as big as Parasite. He wants to pick projects that could challenge him to be characters beyond the Girin character he created for RM. And how can you blame the guy for not wanted to be pigeonholed in a single role for the rest of his life.",

Oh Jung Se, supporting actor in Its okay to not be okay, got all the accolades and the public love. The baeksang best actor award wasn't given to Song Joongki for Vincenzo. Despite both Vincenzo and Joongki's popularity, the award was given to Shin Ha-Kyun of Beyond Evil, an almost 50 year old seasoned actor. Even outside of Korea, Parasite is unarguably the most popular Korean film, and you can't really attribute the success of the standout actors like Song Kang Ho and Lee Jeong-Eun to their appearance. \n\nPoint is Kwangsoo does not need to be popular he only need to be a good actor attached to interesting highbudget projects. He is popular enough to get those projects. You never know, he could star, maybe even as a supporting role, in a film as big as Parasite. He wants to pick projects that could challenge him to be characters beyond the Girin character he created for RM. And how can you blame the guy for not wanted to be pigeonholed in a single role for the rest of his life.",
