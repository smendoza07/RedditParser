    "body": "... that my older sister was highly likely a sugar baby in her younger years. \n\nShe always dated men older than our dad, who would spoil her with gifts, dental work and travel trips but being the innocent person that I was (and still am lol), I never made the connection that she was probably those men's sugar baby. \n\n... until today when she posted this image on Facebook: [https://imgur.com/a/i8F9QWJ](https://imgur.com/a/i8F9QWJ)\n\nShe's married now, ironically to a guy more than 10 years younger than her when all her life, she loved older men. In case some of you might think she's an SM too, that's likely not possible as well as I know very well her financial situation (which is not the best).\n\nStrange that I thought I had stumbled upon the sugar bowl on my own when probably, some of the memories of seeing my sister with her \"bfs\" probably influenced me somehow to join the bowl. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, if any of y'all have been told to work from home like me, remember to stand up and stretch regularly and always wash your hands for 20 seconds.\n\nTake care and stay safe everyone!",

I thought to myself what kind of friends does she know that are that generous? \n\nNow that i'm older i realized their older sister in America was basically a spoiled gf all along uptil her marriage. So the women on that side of the family have some kinda luck to keep attracting dudes willing to spend on them & theres a lot more people in the bowl than we know.",
