Like we never really see Kuruma in his glorious form but even just no tail transform makes Naruto 500% more scary. Also, Garaa and 1-tail were absolutely killing people left and right and almost invincible. We know that even the weakest of tailed beasts is just mass destruction weapon and it makes us more curious how the strongest will be like.\n\nThen Kishimoto jobbed all tailed beasts to boost Akatsuki and we never really know for sure how strong they are, until the last part but then Naruto has became Goku. Naruto has track record of hyping up things then just jobbed them for no reason.",

When he went ninetails on Pain it was so hype I couldn\u2019t stop giggling. It was actually chilling. The score, the situation, the plain hopelessness and raw pain Naruto was experiencing. It was the best arc in the show IMO. At the end it just looks okay. It didn\u2019t have the same badass effect it once did.",

Like we never really see Kuruma in his glorious form but even just no tail transform makes Naruto 500% more scary. Also, Garaa and 1-tail were absolutely killing people left and right and almost invincible. We know that even the weakest of tailed beasts is just mass destruction weapon and it makes us more curious how the strongest will be like.\n\nThen Kishimoto jobbed all tailed beasts to boost Akatsuki and we never really know for sure how strong they are, until the last part but then Naruto has became Goku. Naruto has track record of hyping up things then just jobbed them for no reason.",
