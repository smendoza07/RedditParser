I just read the chapters with Kimimaro and they\u2019re awesome but utterly grotesque and macabre.\n\nThe peak of this was his shoulder splitting open and him pushing his arm bone out into a sword. The muscles snapping around it made me gag as I read. \n\nI\u2019m near the end of the series now and it\u2019s somehow the opposite? People are trading eyes like marbles, limbs are very optional, and you can stand upright and live after having a hole the size of a bowling ball put through the middle of your chest. This does cause the coughing up of blood, maybe a little more than a normal blow to the abdomen.",

I just read the chapters with Kimimaro and they\u2019re awesome but utterly grotesque and macabre.\n\nThe peak of this was his shoulder splitting open and him pushing his arm bone out into a sword. The muscles snapping around it made me gag as I read. \n\nI\u2019m near the end of the series now and it\u2019s somehow the opposite? People are trading eyes like marbles, limbs are very optional, and you can stand upright and live after having a hole the size of a bowling ball put through the middle of your chest. This does cause the coughing up of blood, maybe a little more than a normal blow to the abdomen.",
