There are a few where I'm not a fan of the animation, but it doesn't mean that the fight isn't awesome. I read the manga, I know the fights were awesome. That doesn't mean I have to like animation where people turn into soup. \n\n2) Bleach fights are a mess of an entirely different order of magnitude. The Bleach show was PLAGUED with so much needless extra animation, just to draw out the series because they were trying to space out the show. I thought the episode recaps were bad in Naruto, but in Bleach, they are just unbearable. You are effectively watching the same fight two or three times between two or three episodes, because they recap *the entire fight*. It's miserable, and I wouldn't want any show to suffer from that. \n\n3) You are presenting a false dichotomy. This isn't an either/or. It isn't like the only options are \"Naruto characters turn to soup\" and \"Bleach fights where every second is recapped and it takes 10 minutes to show 10 seconds of action\". There are a lot of styles of animation, and all I'm saying is I don't like fights where the characters melt. We can expect quality from the things we enjoy. We don't have to settle for one of two bad options. \n\n4) I actually have no problem with this animation style when it is done properly. In fact, when done properly, it shouldn't even really be noticeable. The problem with these fights specifically is that it is really noticeable, because the frames of the deformed characters last too long. \n\nIt's okay to criticize art. Fans can like the series and criticize the animation. It's arguably the most iconic and popular anime of the last 30 years (if not one of the most), and one of my personal favorites, but that doesn't mean it's exempt from criticism. But for some reason, fans take it really personally when you say you don't like the animation of a few fights. I don't fully understand why. It's okay for people to not like stuff.",

I recognize  that that fight's different animation style is a creative choice and skilled professionals still spent a fair amount of time on it.\n\nMy point was that I double checked and there's definitely more than just a few seconds of that episode that uses that animation style because it's easy to see when it switches back and forth between the simpler, stylized \"it's mostly smear frames\" style and the regular style.\n\nSo I'm not really sure what else I might've been wrong about.",

There are a few where I'm not a fan of the animation, but it doesn't mean that the fight isn't awesome. I read the manga, I know the fights were awesome. That doesn't mean I have to like animation where people turn into soup. \n\n2) Bleach fights are a mess of an entirely different order of magnitude. The Bleach show was PLAGUED with so much needless extra animation, just to draw out the series because they were trying to space out the show. I thought the episode recaps were bad in Naruto, but in Bleach, they are just unbearable. You are effectively watching the same fight two or three times between two or three episodes, because they recap *the entire fight*. It's miserable, and I wouldn't want any show to suffer from that. \n\n3) You are presenting a false dichotomy. This isn't an either/or. It isn't like the only options are \"Naruto characters turn to soup\" and \"Bleach fights where every second is recapped and it takes 10 minutes to show 10 seconds of action\". There are a lot of styles of animation, and all I'm saying is I don't like fights where the characters melt. We can expect quality from the things we enjoy. We don't have to settle for one of two bad options. \n\n4) I actually have no problem with this animation style when it is done properly. In fact, when done properly, it shouldn't even really be noticeable. The problem with these fights specifically is that it is really noticeable, because the frames of the deformed characters last too long. \n\nIt's okay to criticize art. Fans can like the series and criticize the animation. It's arguably the most iconic and popular anime of the last 30 years (if not one of the most), and one of my personal favorites, but that doesn't mean it's exempt from criticism. But for some reason, fans take it really personally when you say you don't like the animation of a few fights. I don't fully understand why. It's okay for people to not like stuff.",

I recognize  that that fight's different animation style is a creative choice and skilled professionals still spent a fair amount of time on it.\n\nMy point was that I double checked and there's definitely more than just a few seconds of that episode that uses that animation style because it's easy to see when it switches back and forth between the simpler, stylized \"it's mostly smear frames\" style and the regular style.\n\nSo I'm not really sure what else I might've been wrong about.",

There are a few where I'm not a fan of the animation, but it doesn't mean that the fight isn't awesome. I read the manga, I know the fights were awesome. That doesn't mean I have to like animation where people turn into soup. \n\n2) Bleach fights are a mess of an entirely different order of magnitude. The Bleach show was PLAGUED with so much needless extra animation, just to draw out the series because they were trying to space out the show. I thought the episode recaps were bad in Naruto, but in Bleach, they are just unbearable. You are effectively watching the same fight two or three times between two or three episodes, because they recap *the entire fight*. It's miserable, and I wouldn't want any show to suffer from that. \n\n3) You are presenting a false dichotomy. This isn't an either/or. It isn't like the only options are \"Naruto characters turn to soup\" and \"Bleach fights where every second is recapped and it takes 10 minutes to show 10 seconds of action\". There are a lot of styles of animation, and all I'm saying is I don't like fights where the characters melt. We can expect quality from the things we enjoy. We don't have to settle for one of two bad options. \n\n4) I actually have no problem with this animation style when it is done properly. In fact, when done properly, it shouldn't even really be noticeable. The problem with these fights specifically is that it is really noticeable, because the frames of the deformed characters last too long. \n\nIt's okay to criticize art. Fans can like the series and criticize the animation. It's arguably the most iconic and popular anime of the last 30 years (if not one of the most), and one of my personal favorites, but that doesn't mean it's exempt from criticism. But for some reason, fans take it really personally when you say you don't like the animation of a few fights. I don't fully understand why. It's okay for people to not like stuff.",

Pain fight wasn't haphazardly slapped together in a few hours from shitty sketches drawn by a drunk person. It was a harsh joke. I recognize  that that fight's different animation style is a creative choice and skilled professionals still spent a fair amount of time on it.\n\nMy point was that I double checked and there's definitely more than just a few seconds of that episode that uses that animation style because it's easy to see when it switches back and forth between the simpler, stylized \"it's mostly smear frames\" style and the regular style.\n\nSo I'm not really sure what else I might've been wrong about.",

            "body": "A few things:\n\n1) I like the fights in Naruto. A lot. Many of them are awesome. Most of them are really well animated. There are a few where I'm not a fan of the animation, but it doesn't mean that the fight isn't awesome. I read the manga, I know the fights were awesome. That doesn't mean I have to like animation where people turn into soup. \n\n2) Bleach fights are a mess of an entirely different order of magnitude. The Bleach show was PLAGUED with so much needless extra animation, just to draw out the series because they were trying to space out the show. I thought the episode recaps were bad in Naruto, but in Bleach, they are just unbearable. You are effectively watching the same fight two or three times between two or three episodes, because they recap *the entire fight*. It's miserable, and I wouldn't want any show to suffer from that. \n\n3) You are presenting a false dichotomy. This isn't an either/or. It isn't like the only options are \"Naruto characters turn to soup\" and \"Bleach fights where every second is recapped and it takes 10 minutes to show 10 seconds of action\". There are a lot of styles of animation, and all I'm saying is I don't like fights where the characters melt. We can expect quality from the things we enjoy. We don't have to settle for one of two bad options. \n\n4) I actually have no problem with this animation style when it is done properly. In fact, when done properly, it shouldn't even really be noticeable. The problem with these fights specifically is that it is really noticeable, because the frames of the deformed characters last too long. \n\nIt's okay to criticize art. Fans can like the series and criticize the animation. It's arguably the most iconic and popular anime of the last 30 years (if not one of the most), and one of my personal favorites, but that doesn't mean it's exempt from criticism. But for some reason, fans take it really personally when you say you don't like the animation of a few fights. I don't fully understand why. It's okay for people to not like stuff.",
