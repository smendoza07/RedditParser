    "body": "This is just a little reminder, it doesn't matter if you're an SD or an SB, the person sitting on the other side of the table at the next M&G or date you go on is a human person, who breathes and has feelings and emotions and reacts to your behavior.  Be firm and put your foot down when they misstep and next them when they show you crazy, but when they don't - treat them well.\n\nIn sugar dating there is always the temptation to get whatever you can get, at the cost of dehumanizing the other person.  Don't do that.\n\nPSA over.",

I am sorry this happened to you and I am so happy you stand your ground and keep your confidence as you should. Never ever second guess yourself like you say. If someone attempts to waste your time walk away. Frankly at that point I wouldnt even care about 30 because it is just emotional torture not worth it. You will always find someone who values your time and respect you.",

Your free trial membership about to run out?\n\nOr the gents who just send a digit amount that\u2019s pretty much insulting.\nFour bills ? For what, coffee?\n\nThere\u2019s a couple very important possible emergency expenses that minimum need to be allotted for for the health safety of the SB by the SD\u2019s maintenance funds. So that alone (two things come to mind) is already a k and a half ...\n\nI just relocated to SoCal so maybe I\u2019m getting this wanna-be LA con-daddy vibe from these thirtysomething y/ o guys...I felt way more at ease and \u201csafe\u201d with papi\u2019s in the suburbs of Chicago.\nAn authenticity and aggressive yet gentle and chivalrous demeanor that I see I miss... \n\n\nMy first experience was kind of accidental, but I took those digits and never looked back. the \u201c***lionaires \u201d who bat an eye at a few grand aren\u2019t really *** figure anything\u2019s, just sad hearted boys, who\u2019s actions suggest a compromised relationship with their mother. \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\ude05\n\n\nIt\u2019s all a very curios condition. \nResearch is a bulk portion of my education so both sides of the behaviors intrigue me. \n\nI\u2019ve heard some sketchy stories from guys on SA about SoCal chicks and the rip off game that is seemly rampant now. For some reason all that comes to mind is tweaker chicks with that\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\nI inadvertently use the SA platform almost as a bare minimum playing field of I do well without the men, I don\u2019t need them for squat. My networth is heavier then most of the dwads trying to holler. But I HATE being swindled by losers, lying, and trying to sleezeball into my pants. Disgusts me that large populations of men behave with this mentality. And ya, dinner isn\u2019t a ticket into my pants. Or any woman\u2019s pants. Period .\n\nThat\u2019s where SA is kind of like the fair. \nWhy charge an admission fee?\nTo keep the trash out. \n\nExcuse my rant. I really enjoy yall\u2019s reflections on experiences. \n\nY\u2019all playing with world domination. Get it. \u2764\ufe0f",

I am sorry this happened to you and I am so happy you stand your ground and keep your confidence as you should. Never ever second guess yourself like you say. If someone attempts to waste your time walk away. Frankly at that point I wouldnt even care about 30 because it is just emotional torture not worth it.
