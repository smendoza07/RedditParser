Did it happen in the movie or the anime ?\n\nBut the fact still stands that boruto is said to be a prodigy since he graduated at the top of his class, could perform various chakra nature jutsu before he even graduated and had decent fight experience before the chunin exams. \n\nAnd its been literally shown that the only reason he cheated during the exams was bc he didnt had any confidence in his own abilities and didn't wanted to put in thoyghts n efforts to win by his own account l and wanted to take the easy way out of situations so that he could show naruto how talented he was.\n\n He was able to take down/go toe to toe against jonin level ninjas before the chunin exams so it doesn't make sense why he'd be weaker against alot of genin level kids(except shinki who really was powerful)",

Momoshiki couldn\u2019t just side step it, yet Boruto manages to easily sidestep Momoshikis guard in order to land a second attack on him. \n\nI can\u2019t stress the difference in power that should be apparent in any human and the ten tails, I mean Momoshiki is literally at this point in the story, the strongest character to appear. A being lesser than Momoshiki (talking about 10 tails) was so powerful that the entire shinobi alliance would not be able to kill it. \n\nAnother lesser being (Kaguya with ten tails absorbed) was so powerful that the combined efforts of Ninetails Six Paths Sage Mode Naruto, Rinnegan Six Paths amped Sasuke, Double EMS Kakashi, and Sakura (lol) all fighting together had no chance of killing her, the only way they could stop her and save the world was to seal her away with some hacks sealing Jutsu granted to them by the sage of six paths.\n\nBoruto just side stepped and slapped the creature more powerful than her. \n\nIt\u2019s like poorly written fanfiction.",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

However, going from not being able to touch the water clones to being able to out pace them because of running up trees? Oof. Water Clones are 1/10 the power of the user, so, they went from less than 1/10th the power of a elite jonin to above 1/10 in a week... \n\nThere's other stuff and it's fine if someone is ok with it but power scaling has always been wacky.",

Kakashi became Hokage and who was his role model in life? Obito, whom before he got crushed by that rock, wanted to be Hokage. And Naruto when he finally was ready, became the Seventh because all throughout the series, he told everyone he was going to be Hokage someday.\n\nSo for the first three no one wanted the job but the next four they either wanted it or were influenced by someone close to them who did.

So the manga is an underdeveloped and bland mess, missing key character development moments that just jumps from hype moment to hype moment with no substance or context in the slightest. And the anime is filler hell trying to not catch up to the manga, which ultimately undermines the tension and build up of the actually important arcs. \n\nAnd yes, I know it's technically not filler as it is all canon, but the sheer amount of pointless episodes where nothing really happens just so the anime doesn't catch up is absurd.",

It barely works, and then Kakashi is the one who finishes Zabuza with the water dragon. \n\nOn the other hand, Konohamaru just cannot seem to keep up with some of the newer characters. Boruto hits harder, speed blitzes faster, and is just stronger in every way, plus eye hax, and now seal hax.

I do hope we see the return of the tailed beasts but I doubt it!<\n\nAnyways all the new characters in boruto are kinda shitty compared to narutos characters. I get that naruto did set the bar really high with people like madara, orochimaru, kabuto, itachi, nagato, minato, hashirama, tobirama, hagaromo, gaara, shino even, danzo (i hate him but he was good character wise), the entirety of the akutski, all this shit. Borutos good characters consist of aliens and literal ninja robots. Deepa was probably on the better end of boruto charicters but they killed him off too. \n\nsorry for this random rant but like, idk i thought boruto was going to be lit for a while but now i lost that hope again",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

It barely works, and then Kakashi is the one who finishes Zabuza with the water dragon. \n\nOn the other hand, Konohamaru just cannot seem to keep up with some of the newer characters.

He has the other tailed beasts technically (though it seems the creators are trashing a lot of old naruto stuff so probably wont use it anymore even if he can), and then sage mode which he can use in seconds. I do hope we see the return of the tailed beasts but I doubt it!<\n\nAnyways all the new characters in boruto are kinda shitty compared to narutos characters. I get that naruto did set the bar really high with people like madara, orochimaru, kabuto, itachi, nagato, minato, hashirama, tobirama, hagaromo, gaara, shino even, danzo (i hate him but he was good character wise), the entirety of the akutski, all this shit. Borutos good characters consist of aliens and literal ninja robots. Deepa was probably on the better end of boruto charicters but they killed him off too. \n\nsorry for this random rant but like, idk i thought boruto was going to be lit for a while but now i lost that hope again",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

The only real damage he takes after that is Sasuke destroying 1 of his rinnegan, he still had the energy to then slap this sasuke many metres away, and to create a Jutsu which almost matched that Uzumaki rasengan shit, yet 12 year old Boruto is finessing him and sidestepping his guard??\n\nHow is Boruto sidestepping someone who can blitz kage level opponents?",

Kakashi became Hokage and who was his role model in life? Obito, whom before he got crushed by that rock, wanted to be Hokage. And Naruto when he finally was ready, became the Seventh because all throughout the series, he told everyone he was going to be Hokage someday.\n\nSo for the first three no one wanted the job but the next four they either wanted it or were influenced by someone close to them who did.

Momoshiki couldn\u2019t just side step it, yet Boruto manages to easily sidestep Momoshikis guard in order to land a second attack on him. \n\nI can\u2019t stress the difference in power that should be apparent in any human and the ten tails, I mean Momoshiki is literally at this point in the story, the strongest character to appear. A being lesser than Momoshiki (talking about 10 tails) was so powerful that the entire shinobi alliance would not be able to kill it. \n\nAnother lesser being (Kaguya with ten tails absorbed) was so powerful that the combined efforts of Ninetails Six Paths Sage Mode Naruto, Rinnegan Six Paths amped Sasuke, Double EMS Kakashi, and Sakura (lol) all fighting together had no chance of killing her, the only way they could stop her and save the world was to seal her away with some hacks sealing Jutsu granted to them by the sage of six paths.\n\nBoruto just side stepped and slapped the creature more powerful than her. \n\nIt\u2019s like poorly written fanfiction.",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

The only real damage he takes after that is Sasuke destroying 1 of his rinnegan, he still had the energy to then slap this sasuke many metres away, and to create a Jutsu which almost matched that Uzumaki rasengan shit, yet 12 year old Boruto is finessing him and sidestepping his guard??\n\nHow is Boruto sidestepping someone who can blitz kage level opponents?",

Momoshiki couldn\u2019t just side step it, yet Boruto manages to easily sidestep Momoshikis guard in order to land a second attack on him. \n\nI can\u2019t stress the difference in power that should be apparent in any human and the ten tails, I mean Momoshiki is literally at this point in the story, the strongest character to appear. A being lesser than Momoshiki (talking about 10 tails) was so powerful that the entire shinobi alliance would not be able to kill it. \n\nAnother lesser being (Kaguya with ten tails absorbed) was so powerful that the combined efforts of Ninetails Six Paths Sage Mode Naruto, Rinnegan Six Paths amped Sasuke, Double EMS Kakashi, and Sakura (lol) all fighting together had no chance of killing her, the only way they could stop her and save the world was to seal her away with some hacks sealing Jutsu granted to them by the sage of six paths.\n\nBoruto just side stepped and slapped the creature more powerful than her. \n\nIt\u2019s like poorly written fanfiction.",

This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

Momoshiki couldn\u2019t just side step it, yet Boruto manages to easily sidestep Momoshikis guard in order to land a second attack on him. \n\nI can\u2019t stress the difference in power that should be apparent in any human and the ten tails, I mean Momoshiki is literally at this point in the story, the strongest character to appear. A being lesser than Momoshiki (talking about 10 tails) was so powerful that the entire shinobi alliance would not be able to kill it. \n\nAnother lesser being (Kaguya with ten tails absorbed) was so powerful that the combined efforts of Ninetails Six Paths Sage Mode Naruto, Rinnegan Six Paths amped Sasuke, Double EMS Kakashi, and Sakura (lol) all fighting together had no chance of killing her, the only way they could stop her and save the world was to seal her away with some hacks sealing Jutsu granted to them by the sage of six paths.\n\nBoruto just side stepped and slapped the creature more powerful than her. \n\nIt\u2019s like poorly written fanfiction.",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

This is part 1 Gai in his base form, that was the speed difference between a Jonin of Gai\u2019s Calibre and Gaara and all the other genins there. This Part 1 Gai in his base form, his speed does not even approach that of someone like Momoshiki, who scales past Kaguya, yet Boruto is slipping his guard like it was nothing.\n\nEven if I could see into the future, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finesse the Flash in a fight, or Superman, or even Batman for that matter most likely, but Boruto is doing it to a God more powerful than all the tailed beasts combined, including Kurama, which half of his chakra alone in its most base chakra mode was enough to change Naruto from a regular shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nMakes no sense.",

A being lesser than Momoshiki (talking about 10 tails) was so powerful that the entire shinobi alliance would not be able to kill it. \n\nAnother lesser being (Kaguya with ten tails absorbed) was so powerful that the combined efforts of Ninetails Six Paths Sage Mode Naruto, Rinnegan Six Paths amped Sasuke, Double EMS Kakashi, and Sakura (lol) all fighting together had no chance of killing her, the only way they could stop her and save the world was to seal her away with some hacks sealing Jutsu granted to them by the sage of six paths.\n\nBoruto just side stepped and slapped the creature more powerful than her. \n\nIt\u2019s like poorly written fanfiction.",
