    "body": "[Previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/12etp04/weird_mg_this_morning_pot_wore_wheelies/)\n\nAfter the m&g I wasn\u2019t excited about wheelie girl and not sure of another date,,,but the positive comments here persuaded me reconsider and think I\u2019m missing out on something great. 2nd date ended up just as weird as the m&g.  \n\nWe meet at a steak restaurant last night and she didn\u2019t wear wheelies,,,sorry Reddit. I almost told her she has many Reddit fans but thought she would get creeped. We talk about what food  to order,,,she said her favorite is green bean casserole.  \n\nI said yuck I don\u2019t like green beans in any form,,,but she said in a loud voice \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that,,, I said I like *green peen casserole.*\u201d  wtf. I was in shock and embarrassed people heard her. Then she has a serious look for few seconds and starts laughing ,,,such a weird girl. I don\u2019t know maybe she is growing on me or making me more uncomfortable,,hard to tell.  \n\nEdit: I will probably do a 3rd date for community entertainment,,,wish me luck.",

Once free, she was nutty and weird but loveable.\n\nI'm trying to think of some of the crazy things she would say, often inappropriate...but the only one that comes to mind right now is lets say she saw a cool car, \"thats derrrrricious with extra ERRRRs.\" or wear a pizza onesie out, or come home with weird animals.\"\n\nOr I ride motorcycles and she wanted her own. Instead of one she could go on rides with me, she chose a ural with a side car so she could bring her dog or get groceries in. \n\nAsk her a question involving math and she would just say \"potato\"",

And actually had a sweet message\u2026..\n\nThe plot was that the main character went on a terrible blind date with a woman, \u201cMissy,\u201d who came across as VERY quirky and at times downright crazy. Long story short, without spoiling the movie, he ends up stuck with her on a corporate trip. \u201cMissy\u201d continues to be quirky and crazy but he discovers she has a great heart and lives life to the fullest\u2026 and she teaches him a thing or two. \n\nSorry for the tangent, but check out the movie !!",

Once free, she was nutty and weird but loveable.\n\nI'm trying to think of some of the crazy things she would say, often inappropriate...but the only one that comes to mind right now is lets say she saw a cool car, \"thats derrrrricious with extra ERRRRs.\" or wear a pizza onesie out, or come home with weird animals.\"\n\nOr I ride motorcycles and she wanted her own. Instead of one she could go on rides with me, she chose a ural with a side car so she could bring her dog or get groceries in. \n\nAsk her a question involving math and she would just say \"potato\"",
