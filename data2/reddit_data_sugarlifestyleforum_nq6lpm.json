    "body": "Some dude from Seeking says he\u2019s okay with my PPM, and he\u2019s okay with meeting 2-6x monthly. \n\nThen tells me he needs to be the only man in my life. I told him \u201csure, for PPMx5 in allowance we can do 4 dates a month, daily texting, and occasional steamy snaps, and you can be my only SD.\u201d \n\nSuddenly he\u2019s all \u201cewww I can\u2019t afford that! What about PPMx2 for 3 meets and some snaps?\u201d\n\nI was like \u201cSir, this is not a buy two get one free sale. I\u2019m a sugar baby. Reconsider what you just said \ud83d\ude02\u201d\n\nTLDR: man who can\u2019t afford the cost of sugaring is still trying to get some sweetness. If he can\u2019t afford to maintain an ongoing sugar relationship, then he\u2019s a fake sugar daddy and he shouldn\u2019t be on a sugar site.",

In the same way a SB needs to have several SDs to cover her lifestyle or simply her needs, we as SDs wonder why to stay with one SB when with the same amount of money you can have 2 or 3 SBs OR you just turn into a serial SD and change SB every month, especially if the girl is going to \"charge\" you for every hour spent together or even every text you exchange...that makes you feel as a SD like a client and not as somebody special...and SDs will not stay for long in an relationship like that.\nI screen girls out that when I perceive they have this kind of transactional approach to the Sugar Bowl even if I can afford their demands.",

I think SDs likely generally have a budget, and at least for a LTSR, do not alter it for different commitments from their SB. The amount is set and provided. SB's however are looking for as close to their vanilla preference, as fit, and as attractive as they can find, and still receive a ppm/allowance. They may be willing to decrease the amount if the guy is close enough to vanilla, or even drop payment all together. I had 1 POT SB, very attractive, educated, pleasant, and to me very desirable. She could not bring herself to have a SR with me, and ended up months later with a much younger, fitter, attractive man who just paid her car payment, about 20% of what I was offering. I do not think if I doubled my offer it would have mattered.",

Yes, on the one hand you offered her more, but it is a sacrifice of sorts to be intimate with someone you aren't genuinely attracted to, and there is still a risk that she might not get much in return. Imagine from a girls perspective, it would be better to be ripped off/deceived by someone you find hot than someone you feel like you would never sleep with without the benefits. \n\nIf she had an arrangement with less financial help but more physical attraction, she probably feels more benefitted because she isn't really making a sacrifice but is still getting a reward. I feel increasingly pragmatic about all kinds of dating as time goes on, and it really is a risk/benefit analysis. Basically it is in her best interest and that's just part of the game. \n\nIt's different once trust is built and that's why many successful arrangements happen where an attractive girl feels valued and supported by her SD, regardless of his age or appearance.",

They just don't exist in the volume required and never can exist. Its just math and the logical corollary of this is while a few SBs may end up happy, most SBs are always going to end up disappointed.\n\nI have two sources of money, income from my dreary day to day existence as an essentially middle class professional, and inherited money that I did not deserve or earn. In my professional capacity I earn about 200K which is well short of the 1% but nonetheless still in about the top 3% of salary earners in my country. After compulsory retirement savings, tax, and expensive school fees there is not a lot left free to support a young woman financially. Personally I would say its actually impossible to any meaningful level and I wouldnt even bother if that was my only money, its only my inherited money that allows me to do it. And yet guys in this sort of salary bracket probably make up most of the SD population, and have more money than most of the male population.\n\nJust some context on why SBs always report encountering 'cheap' men. There are too many SBs chasing too few SDs, the money just isnt out there. Of course many of these men may just be stingy cheapasses as well but ultimately its math.",

Having a wonderful commitment free relationship involving caring, sharing, dates, and sex. \n\nIf a man only has enough money for a quick fuck 2x a month, then he\u2019s not a Sugar Daddy. He\u2019s defintiely not a Sugar Daddy if he expects a woman who\u2019s out of his league to save herself for him alone, and he\u2019s only offering to spoil her in the amount of two quick fucks. That\u2019s a selfish delusional John right thurrr, tbh. \n\nSugar Daddies are not normal. What they want is not normal. They are the exception. The money they have to spend is exceptional. What they expect in return is exceptional.\n\nThere is no shame in being normal. There is no shame in wanting exceptional things. \n\nThere is shame in asking for an exceptional experience when you only have normal money to spend",

Society placed a very high value on intact two-parent families because we recognized that if we didn't sanctify such values under law, we'd have the complete societal breakdown, crime, corruption of the abject welfare state, rampant illegitimacy, etc that we actually do have today because we abandoned the morals and laws that prevented the wide-spread licentiousness which has resulted in most young women having your mindset.  It doesn't ever OCCUR to you to cultivate virtue, to prepare yourself to be a good wife, to associate with people in such a way as to position yourself to be courted and wooed. People like you actually believe such a mindset is stupid, backward, archaic and oppressive, etc.  Yet you do and will endlessly complain about how you're treated when you act like a throwaway piece of garbage instead of a virtuous woman suitable for creating and sustaining a family.",

If a SB says that she needs to be spoiled, even as high a failure rate as I have, I next. Spoiling is what a grand parent does to their grandchild. The grandchild does nothing to deserve the benefit given by the grandparent, so the kid is \"spoiled\" into learning that she receives these gifts for nothing. A SB earns everything that she receives. She spends time with a man who is not like her vanilla preference, she praises him, satisfies him, keeps him happy. Due to her time and efforts he gives to her to reward her behavior, show his appreciation, and encourage more of the same by paying it forward.",

You can blow 10x of that easily if you can't control the spending. Sugaring is expensive.\n\nPPMx2 for 3 meets a month and exclusive like a 2 for 3 sale with a gift?",

                    "body": "As a fat, older (53), disabled-quadriplegic, open marriage SD, I have a very difficult time finding SBs that I am attracted to. I think (although I'm not confident of my theory) that there are different criteria for SDs and SBs in how they choose their partner. I think SDs likely generally have a budget, and at least for a LTSR, do not alter it for different commitments from their SB. The amount is set and provided. SB's however are looking for as close to their vanilla preference, as fit, and as attractive as they can find, and still receive a ppm/allowance. They may be willing to decrease the amount if the guy is close enough to vanilla, or even drop payment all together. I had 1 POT SB, very attractive, educated, pleasant, and to me very desirable. She could not bring herself to have a SR with me, and ended up months later with a much younger, fitter, attractive man who just paid her car payment, about 20% of what I was offering. I do not think if I doubled my offer it would have mattered.",

Yes, on the one hand you offered her more, but it is a sacrifice of sorts to be intimate with someone you aren't genuinely attracted to, and there is still a risk that she might not get much in return. Imagine from a girls perspective, it would be better to be ripped off/deceived by someone you find hot than someone you feel like you would never sleep with without the benefits. \n\nIf she had an arrangement with less financial help but more physical attraction, she probably feels more benefitted because she isn't really making a sacrifice but is still getting a reward. I feel increasingly pragmatic about all kinds of dating as time goes on, and it really is a risk/benefit analysis. Basically it is in her best interest and that's just part of the game. \n\nIt's different once trust is built and that's why many successful arrangements happen where an attractive girl feels valued and supported by her SD, regardless of his age or appearance.",

Women have told us stories of them being raped and other men being stiffed.

That is how I entered the bowl and Ive been fortunate enough to find good, honest SDs. As an SB who is poly, Im genuinely attracted to both my SDs, therefore it feels gross to allow someone to give me less.

Somehow whenever I do that, I get told I\u2019m the escort?\n\nYes, I\u2019m totally an escort because I actually want a nice kind man who will see me 4x a month, give me financial support, and care about me in ways other than just how well I fuck him.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not at all a John because he wants to see me twice a month, in a hotel room, do nothing but fuck, and give me the lowest amount of money he can get away with. \n\nYep, that\u2019s how it is \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",

It doesn't ever OCCUR to you to cultivate virtue, to prepare yourself to be a good wife, to associate with people in such a way as to position yourself to be courted and wooed. People like you actually believe such a mindset is stupid, backward, archaic and oppressive, etc.  Yet you do and will endlessly complain about how you're treated when you act like a throwaway piece of garbage instead of a virtuous woman suitable for creating and sustaining a family.",

I think SDs likely generally have a budget, and at least for a LTSR, do not alter it for different commitments from their SB. The amount is set and provided. SB's however are looking for as close to their vanilla preference, as fit, and as attractive as they can find, and still receive a ppm/allowance. They may be willing to decrease the amount if the guy is close enough to vanilla, or even drop payment all together. I had 1 POT SB, very attractive, educated, pleasant, and to me very desirable. She could not bring herself to have a SR with me, and ended up months later with a much younger, fitter, attractive man who just paid her car payment, about 20% of what I was offering. I do not think if I doubled my offer it would have mattered.",

Yes, on the one hand you offered her more, but it is a sacrifice of sorts to be intimate with someone you aren't genuinely attracted to, and there is still a risk that she might not get much in return. Imagine from a girls perspective, it would be better to be ripped off/deceived by someone you find hot than someone you feel like you would never sleep with without the benefits. \n\nIf she had an arrangement with less financial help but more physical attraction, she probably feels more benefitted because she isn't really making a sacrifice but is still getting a reward. I feel increasingly pragmatic about all kinds of dating as time goes on, and it really is a risk/benefit analysis. Basically it is in her best interest and that's just part of the game. \n\nIt's different once trust is built and that's why many successful arrangements happen where an attractive girl feels valued and supported by her SD, regardless of his age or appearance.",

Society placed a very high value on intact two-parent families because we recognized that if we didn't sanctify such values under law, we'd have the complete societal breakdown, crime, corruption of the abject welfare state, rampant illegitimacy, etc that we actually do have today because we abandoned the morals and laws that prevented the wide-spread licentiousness which has resulted in most young women having your mindset.  It doesn't ever OCCUR to you to cultivate virtue, to prepare yourself to be a good wife, to associate with people in such a way as to position yourself to be courted and wooed. People like you actually believe such a mindset is stupid, backward, archaic and oppressive, etc.  Yet you do and will endlessly complain about how you're treated when you act like a throwaway piece of garbage instead of a virtuous woman suitable for creating and sustaining a family.",

A SB earns everything that she receives. She spends time with a man who is not like her vanilla preference, she praises him, satisfies him, keeps him happy. Due to her time and efforts he gives to her to reward her behavior, show his appreciation, and encourage more of the same by paying it forward.",

Yes, on the one hand you offered her more, but it is a sacrifice of sorts to be intimate with someone you aren't genuinely attracted to, and there is still a risk that she might not get much in return. Imagine from a girls perspective, it would be better to be ripped off/deceived by someone you find hot than someone you feel like you would never sleep with without the benefits. \n\nIf she had an arrangement with less financial help but more physical attraction, she probably feels more benefitted because she isn't really making a sacrifice but is still getting a reward. I feel increasingly pragmatic about all kinds of dating as time goes on, and it really is a risk/benefit analysis. Basically it is in her best interest and that's just part of the game. \n\nIt's different once trust is built and that's why many successful arrangements happen where an attractive girl feels valued and supported by her SD, regardless of his age or appearance.",

It doesn't ever OCCUR to you to cultivate virtue, to prepare yourself to be a good wife, to associate with people in such a way as to position yourself to be courted and wooed.

Society placed a very high value on intact two-parent families because we recognized that if we didn't sanctify such values under law, we'd have the complete societal breakdown, crime, corruption of the abject welfare state, rampant illegitimacy, etc that we actually do have today because we abandoned the morals and laws that prevented the wide-spread licentiousness which has resulted in most young women having your mindset.  It doesn't ever OCCUR to you to cultivate virtue, to prepare yourself to be a good wife, to associate with people in such a way as to position yourself to be courted and wooed. People like you actually believe such a mindset is stupid, backward, archaic and oppressive, etc.  Yet you do and will endlessly complain about how you're treated when you act like a throwaway piece of garbage instead of a virtuous woman suitable for creating and sustaining a family.",

Rape is mostly a risk females inherit just because they were born.  Sad but true. It doesn't mean your predestined outcome in a sugaring gone wrong situation is rape or that you automatically trump in any argument because rape exists.  \n\nThe only two options are not get raped or be stiffed.  Both sides have risks and rewards.\n\nSometimes watching this stuff is like \"They forgot the ketchup and I 'm sad\" and someone comes along and says \"So what, I could have been raped!\".  Yes, that statement is true but it often is an extreme reaction and doesn't really have anything to do with the situation at hand.",

Women have told us stories of them being raped and other men being stiffed. In the grand scheme of things, rape is worse than losing a couple of Benjamins.\n\nI wrote about good-faith SBs, people who enter the bowl not wanting to screw people over. That is how I entered the bowl and Ive been fortunate enough to find good, honest SDs. As an SB who is poly, Im genuinely attracted to both my SDs, therefore it feels gross to allow someone to give me less. My sugar partners are in the same age range and I prefer to date people 50+ anyways. If a dude in his 60s offered me half of what my sugar partners give me, it wouldnt matter how good the chemistry was. I\u2019d reject him.",
