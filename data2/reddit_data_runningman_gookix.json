    "body": "Okay just being honest here. When the PD changed back to Chul Min, I was happy because the episodes before started to get more and more boring. And PD Chul Min did deliver. The games were funny and I enjoyed watching RM more. So when I heard that Chul Min was leaving and there will be another PD, I was expecting RM to be different and somewhat fearing that it will get boring and less fun. It\u2019s been several episodes with the new PD, and I actually enjoyed the new games thoroughly. They\u2019re new games and they are funny as heck. Especially the \u201cDefend the cookies\u201d game. Too bad they won\u2019t play that game anymore. Anyway, I just want to say that I am happy with the new PD. Not sure if the writers changed or not but the new games they brought are fresh and fun. Love this show! It\u2019s amazing how this show had been my favorite show ever since the first episode. And that\u2019s been more than 500 episodes and 10 years!! Good job, Running Man!",
