To imply that Naruto was capable of that consistent level of leadership, maturity, and responsibility is absurd. We love Naruto for his faults, the reason the story is so good is because those faults have held him back at time and we the fans as imperfect humans relate to that. The only two that deserved Chunin were shikamaru and Shino. Even Neji had too many personal demons to be considered mature let\u2019s not forget he attempted to kill his younger weaker female cousin all because of her position in the clan.",

Why wouldn't women also want shino present? While this is realtively harmless in the grand scheme of things, that doesn't mean it isn't problematic. People like to use the word sexist in only extreme scenarios, and yes we need to differentiate between extreme sexism and microaggressions, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't label microaggressions for what they are.",

To imply that Naruto was capable of that consistent level of leadership, maturity, and responsibility is absurd. We love Naruto for his faults, the reason the story is so good is because those faults have held him back at time and we the fans as imperfect humans relate to that. The only two that deserved Chunin were shikamaru and Shino. Even Neji had too many personal demons to be considered mature let\u2019s not forget he attempted to kill his younger weaker female cousin all because of her position in the clan.",

Why wouldn't women also want shino present? While this is realtively harmless in the grand scheme of things, that doesn't mean it isn't problematic. People like to use the word sexist in only extreme scenarios, and yes we need to differentiate between extreme sexism and microaggressions, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't label microaggressions for what they are.",

Even Neji had too many personal demons to be considered mature let\u2019s not forget he attempted to kill his younger weaker female cousin all because of her position in the clan.",

Why wouldn't women also want shino present? While this is realtively harmless in the grand scheme of things, that doesn't mean it isn't problematic. People like to use the word sexist in only extreme scenarios, and yes we need to differentiate between extreme sexism and microaggressions, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't label microaggressions for what they are.",

We love Naruto for his faults, the reason the story is so good is because those faults have held him back at time and we the fans as imperfect humans relate to that. The only two that deserved Chunin were shikamaru and Shino. Even Neji had too many personal demons to be considered mature let\u2019s not forget he attempted to kill his younger weaker female cousin all because of her position in the clan.",

Why wouldn't women also want shino present? While this is realtively harmless in the grand scheme of things, that doesn't mean it isn't problematic.

Why wouldn't women also want shino present? While this is realtively harmless in the grand scheme of things, that doesn't mean it isn't problematic.
