    "body": "Just today as I was checking Linked-in, I saw that I had a connect request from someone I had a meet and greet once with years ago. Before I go to block him, I take the opportunity to do some googling, for curiosity's sake. \n\nAnd oh my gosh, all the headlines are as follows:\n\"Husband of Unsolved murder victim arrested for stabbing\"\n\"Husband whose wife was killed in unsolved slaying accused of stabbing\"\n\"Millis man accused in stabbing to be in court\"\n\nAnd so on and so fourth...\n\nHe was a fucking asshole on the meet and greet, including arriving late and not apologizing, ordering for me, and immediately wanting to play a \"question\" game, which of course he tried to turn sexual, in the middle of a fucking PF Chang's. \n\nNeedless to say I noped away from that heart-throb. But damn, it's unnerving how easily he found me... After all these years. \n\nEven if he didn't murder his wife (I think he did), he was abusive to her, and she had a restraining order on him, as well as their multiple kids. \n\nThis shit is just freaky. Always trust your gut, folks. \n\nsorry guys but HOLY SHIT. still processing this all. WHAT THE FUCK.",

I saw a POT that I never wanted to see again in my \u201cWho you may know\u201d on instagram. That\u2019s extremely dangerous! Like, wth instagram and Facebook. \nAnyways, make sure you delete all numbers connected to potentials from your phone.. I think that\u2019s what these sites are using to match us and stuff.

            "body": "That is extremely extremely unnerving but I am going to try to say something to relieve you a bit, hopefully. Social media platforms like that have very sophisticated ways of linking people together and then recommending them as connections. Sometimes those algorithms don't get it right and they suggest people totally random and sometimes they suggest people you actively don't want to be connected to. That's why people see like their boyfriend's ex-girlfriends step-mom in Find Friends on Facebook. Their priority is getting more connected users so they don't optimism for accuracy.\n\nSo it's probably most likely that you were recommended as a connection (rather than actually tried to hunt you down and reach out to you years later). Hopefully if that happened he added you not because he recognized you but because he was like \"hey a pretty girl why not\". It's also possible he just unthinkingly likes everyone recommended to him. I have probably 1,000 connections on LinkedIn and about 90% of them are people I have never met, who don't live in my city or work in my field, and I just unthinkingly accepted everyone cuz I check it like once a year and just clear them all out quickly.",
