There were two other close ranged jonin with them during that fight, Asuma didn't die because of Shikamaru, he died because they had no idea what they were up against. The only reason Asuma lasted as long as he did was because of Shikamarus jutsu style. The Sharingan would have done nothing to help him in that fight, even with Genjutsu, it would have been the same as when he got caught by the possession jutsu only worse because Kakazu would have gotten involved sooner. The Sharingan is useful in most cases but not so much when you are fighting a literal immortal.",

There were two other close ranged jonin with them during that fight, Asuma didn't die because of Shikamaru, he died because they had no idea what they were up against. The only reason Asuma lasted as long as he did was because of Shikamarus jutsu style. The Sharingan would have done nothing to help him in that fight, even with Genjutsu, it would have been the same as when he got caught by the possession jutsu only worse because Kakazu would have gotten involved sooner.

If shikamaru is able to distract him with a sharingan and not losing a drop of blood in the process(which should be possible because child sasuke did it) then mostly likely asuma wouldnt have died.",

There were two other close ranged jonin with them during that fight, Asuma didn't die because of Shikamaru, he died because they had no idea what they were up against. The only reason Asuma lasted as long as he did was because of Shikamarus jutsu style. The Sharingan would have done nothing to help him in that fight, even with Genjutsu, it would have been the same as when he got caught by the possession jutsu only worse because Kakazu would have gotten involved sooner. The Sharingan is useful in most cases but not so much when you are fighting a literal immortal.",

There were two other close ranged jonin with them during that fight, Asuma didn't die because of Shikamaru, he died because they had no idea what they were up against. The only reason Asuma lasted as long as he did was because of Shikamarus jutsu style. The Sharingan would have done nothing to help him in that fight, even with Genjutsu, it would have been the same as when he got caught by the possession jutsu only worse because Kakazu would have gotten involved sooner. The Sharingan is useful in most cases but not so much when you are fighting a literal immortal.",
