Second, that was before he died and left a karma. It's been established in Boruto that when an Ohsutsuki uses Karma to revive they evolve and become stronger. Upon being forced to revive inside Jigen, Isshiki went from pushing a drained and ambushed Naruto and Sasuke to kicking them around at full strength like tin cans. It's a massive power spike. Finally, I like Sasuke. I have for a long time. And yes, he got nerfed so the plot can calm down a little and not have every enemy be stronger than Kaguya, but it made sense in-universe, it was explained, and it was needed. People crying about Sasuke losing his Rinnegan come across as children upset that their favorite toy lost an arm. That, to me, feels like the real disrespect to his character.",

Well, kaguya had potential but it was never fulfilled because boruto had to happen for money reasons. \n\nQuick question, why do you like Sasuke? No offense, like what you want, but im just curious because I've never been able to stand him. \n\nI still don't understand how you get stronger from being newly born. Like do you get the strength of the host because if so then momoshikki is still weak as fuck and should be beat by Naruto easily since boruto is a weak ass child. \n\nYou said that not every enemy is stronger then kaguya and that it makes sense in universe, but to me it doesn't at all. Boruto as a whole just doesn't make sense and was badly set up, but nerfing Naruto and Sasuke even though they should be in their prime is just ridiculous. Like making Naruto a little slower and rusty, fine, sure, but when he can't even produce 1 shadow clone or chase down a random ass villager, there's a problem (parent child day episode). And most people take borutos anime as canon, and i haven't read the manga, I tried but the art was atroshish, so I pray to God this is filler, but kishimoto himself stated that boruto anime is canon. Nerfing the 2 when they are much older, maybe 50 or 60 (going off the sanins ages) and maybe even older with Naruto, makes sense. But. . . . Now im rambling and forgot what I was talking about",

I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",

If he\u2019d never gotten it he\u2019d probably be at least close to Minato\u2019s level by the time we meet him, since he wouldn\u2019t be forced to develop his techniques around it and could continue to refine his generalist techniques like he was before getting it. It definitely helps him in combat, but it\u2019s really hindered his long-term development. Think that\u2019s why he advanced so far so fast as Hokage Kakashi in the light novels.",

Or how about Boroshiki, who he had Naruto's help defeating the weaker version of, who moved so fast that his Rinnegan couldn't even pick up on it until it was crushed and dead? You can complain all you want if you think the Ohtsutskis are too strong or whatever, fine. But straight up lying like this, insulting the people working on it, just to protect your pride that you've tied to Sasuke? That ain't it, chief. We can do better.",

Second, that was before he died and left a karma. It's been established in Boruto that when an Ohsutsuki uses Karma to revive they evolve and become stronger. Upon being forced to revive inside Jigen, Isshiki went from pushing a drained and ambushed Naruto and Sasuke to kicking them around at full strength like tin cans. It's a massive power spike. Finally, I like Sasuke. I have for a long time. And yes, he got nerfed so the plot can calm down a little and not have every enemy be stronger than Kaguya, but it made sense in-universe, it was explained, and it was needed. People crying about Sasuke losing his Rinnegan come across as children upset that their favorite toy lost an arm. That, to me, feels like the real disrespect to his character.",

Well, kaguya had potential but it was never fulfilled because boruto had to happen for money reasons. \n\nQuick question, why do you like Sasuke? No offense, like what you want, but im just curious because I've never been able to stand him. \n\nI still don't understand how you get stronger from being newly born. Like do you get the strength of the host because if so then momoshikki is still weak as fuck and should be beat by Naruto easily since boruto is a weak ass child. \n\nYou said that not every enemy is stronger then kaguya and that it makes sense in universe, but to me it doesn't at all. Boruto as a whole just doesn't make sense and was badly set up, but nerfing Naruto and Sasuke even though they should be in their prime is just ridiculous. Like making Naruto a little slower and rusty, fine, sure, but when he can't even produce 1 shadow clone or chase down a random ass villager, there's a problem (parent child day episode). And most people take borutos anime as canon, and i haven't read the manga, I tried but the art was atroshish, so I pray to God this is filler, but kishimoto himself stated that boruto anime is canon. Nerfing the 2 when they are much older, maybe 50 or 60 (going off the sanins ages) and maybe even older with Naruto, makes sense. But. . . . Now im rambling and forgot what I was talking about",

I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",

Second, that was before he died and left a karma. It's been established in Boruto that when an Ohsutsuki uses Karma to revive they evolve and become stronger. Upon being forced to revive inside Jigen, Isshiki went from pushing a drained and ambushed Naruto and Sasuke to kicking them around at full strength like tin cans. It's a massive power spike. Finally, I like Sasuke. I have for a long time. And yes, he got nerfed so the plot can calm down a little and not have every enemy be stronger than Kaguya, but it made sense in-universe, it was explained, and it was needed. People crying about Sasuke losing his Rinnegan come across as children upset that their favorite toy lost an arm. That, to me, feels like the real disrespect to his character.",

No offense, like what you want, but im just curious because I've never been able to stand him. \n\nI still don't understand how you get stronger from being newly born. Like do you get the strength of the host because if so then momoshikki is still weak as fuck and should be beat by Naruto easily since boruto is a weak ass child. \n\nYou said that not every enemy is stronger then kaguya and that it makes sense in universe, but to me it doesn't at all. Boruto as a whole just doesn't make sense and was badly set up, but nerfing Naruto and Sasuke even though they should be in their prime is just ridiculous. Like making Naruto a little slower and rusty, fine, sure, but when he can't even produce 1 shadow clone or chase down a random ass villager, there's a problem (parent child day episode). And most people take borutos anime as canon, and i haven't read the manga, I tried but the art was atroshish, so I pray to God this is filler, but kishimoto himself stated that boruto anime is canon. Nerfing the 2 when they are much older, maybe 50 or 60 (going off the sanins ages) and maybe even older with Naruto, makes sense. But. . . . Now im rambling and forgot what I was talking about",

I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",

It's been established in Boruto that when an Ohsutsuki uses Karma to revive they evolve and become stronger. Upon being forced to revive inside Jigen, Isshiki went from pushing a drained and ambushed Naruto and Sasuke to kicking them around at full strength like tin cans. It's a massive power spike. Finally, I like Sasuke. I have for a long time. And yes, he got nerfed so the plot can calm down a little and not have every enemy be stronger than Kaguya, but it made sense in-universe, it was explained, and it was needed. People crying about Sasuke losing his Rinnegan come across as children upset that their favorite toy lost an arm. That, to me, feels like the real disrespect to his character.",

Well, kaguya had potential but it was never fulfilled because boruto had to happen for money reasons. \n\nQuick question, why do you like Sasuke? No offense, like what you want, but im just curious because I've never been able to stand him. \n\nI still don't understand how you get stronger from being newly born. Like do you get the strength of the host because if so then momoshikki is still weak as fuck and should be beat by Naruto easily since boruto is a weak ass child. \n\nYou said that not every enemy is stronger then kaguya and that it makes sense in universe, but to me it doesn't at all. Boruto as a whole just doesn't make sense and was badly set up, but nerfing Naruto and Sasuke even though they should be in their prime is just ridiculous. Like making Naruto a little slower and rusty, fine, sure, but when he can't even produce 1 shadow clone or chase down a random ass villager, there's a problem (parent child day episode). And most people take borutos anime as canon, and i haven't read the manga, I tried but the art was atroshish, so I pray to God this is filler, but kishimoto himself stated that boruto anime is canon. Nerfing the 2 when they are much older, maybe 50 or 60 (going off the sanins ages) and maybe even older with Naruto, makes sense. But. . . . Now im rambling and forgot what I was talking about",

I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",

It's been established in Boruto that when an Ohsutsuki uses Karma to revive they evolve and become stronger. Upon being forced to revive inside Jigen, Isshiki went from pushing a drained and ambushed Naruto and Sasuke to kicking them around at full strength like tin cans. It's a massive power spike. Finally, I like Sasuke. I have for a long time. And yes, he got nerfed so the plot can calm down a little and not have every enemy be stronger than Kaguya, but it made sense in-universe, it was explained, and it was needed. People crying about Sasuke losing his Rinnegan come across as children upset that their favorite toy lost an arm. That, to me, feels like the real disrespect to his character.",

Well, kaguya had potential but it was never fulfilled because boruto had to happen for money reasons. \n\nQuick question, why do you like Sasuke? No offense, like what you want, but im just curious because I've never been able to stand him. \n\nI still don't understand how you get stronger from being newly born. Like do you get the strength of the host because if so then momoshikki is still weak as fuck and should be beat by Naruto easily since boruto is a weak ass child. \n\nYou said that not every enemy is stronger then kaguya and that it makes sense in universe, but to me it doesn't at all. Boruto as a whole just doesn't make sense and was badly set up, but nerfing Naruto and Sasuke even though they should be in their prime is just ridiculous. Like making Naruto a little slower and rusty, fine, sure, but when he can't even produce 1 shadow clone or chase down a random ass villager, there's a problem (parent child day episode). And most people take borutos anime as canon, and i haven't read the manga, I tried but the art was atroshish, so I pray to God this is filler, but kishimoto himself stated that boruto anime is canon. Nerfing the 2 when they are much older, maybe 50 or 60 (going off the sanins ages) and maybe even older with Naruto, makes sense. But. . . . Now im rambling and forgot what I was talking about",

                            "body": "Yeah, the anime is atrocious. I tried watching it way back when and it threw me off of Boruto for years. I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",

Well, kaguya had potential but it was never fulfilled because boruto had to happen for money reasons. \n\nQuick question, why do you like Sasuke? No offense, like what you want, but im just curious because I've never been able to stand him. \n\nI still don't understand how you get stronger from being newly born. Like do you get the strength of the host because if so then momoshikki is still weak as fuck and should be beat by Naruto easily since boruto is a weak ass child. \n\nYou said that not every enemy is stronger then kaguya and that it makes sense in universe, but to me it doesn't at all. Boruto as a whole just doesn't make sense and was badly set up, but nerfing Naruto and Sasuke even though they should be in their prime is just ridiculous. Like making Naruto a little slower and rusty, fine, sure, but when he can't even produce 1 shadow clone or chase down a random ass villager, there's a problem (parent child day episode). And most people take borutos anime as canon, and i haven't read the manga, I tried but the art was atroshish, so I pray to God this is filler, but kishimoto himself stated that boruto anime is canon. Nerfing the 2 when they are much older, maybe 50 or 60 (going off the sanins ages) and maybe even older with Naruto, makes sense. But. . . . Now im rambling and forgot what I was talking about",

                    "body": "Yeah, the anime is atrocious. I tried watching it way back when and it threw me off of Boruto for years. I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",

I also used to think the manga art was bad too, but it's actually really good. It's just that Ikemoto has a more realistic and detailed artstyle than Kishimoto, and he has some trouble trying to simplify it to look like his. It gets much better as you read though. For reference, Ikemoto did the backgrounds on Naruto since like chapter 3 or something up until the end. His backgrounds and environments in Boruto are breathtaking. I can link some if you want.\n\nI used to hate Sasuke as a kid. I thought he was kind of a bully and a dickhead. But as I grew older I just kind of grew the ability to empathize with him. His whole family was slaughtered by his favorite member of that family who then forced him to relive the experience over and over again. I totally get feeling betrayed and angry and wanting to hunt Itachi down and kill him. I understand working at something you've been so single-minded at and the shock of being outclassed by someone you thought was a goof that didn't take things seriously. It feels like whatever you're doing isn't good enough. Of course he'd leave with one of the legendary Sanin after Naruto just training with one of them buffed him up so much. After he killed Itachi he was straight up having a mental breakdown where he was not allowed by Obito the proper time to process or grieve his rage and feeling of betrayal of Itachi was magnified and turned to the Leaf. Then after meeting Itachi again he finally got the necessary time to sift through everything and processes it all. He got to say goodbye. And he decides he's still beyond pissed off about a system where people like Itachi can be forced into becoming people like Itachi. And so, he talks to the Hokage. He hears them out since for once his head is cool enough to reason again, and he decides that the Leaf isn't the problem but human nature. So his new plan, after seeing Madara unite the entire world in order to fight him, is to essentially do that. Just become a strong boogeyman that forces the world into peace with itself through shared hatred of him. But he knows he has to kill Naruto to do it since he's the one person who not only wouldn't let him shoulder that burden, but could also challenge him. He gets his arm blown off and realizes that Naruto is strong enough to do it his way, both in resolve and strength. But he still can't live peacefully himself with all the crimes he's committed, so he pushes himself into self-imposed exile until he feels like he's made up for it, all the meanwhile protecting the village from the shadows, doing to the unclean things so Naruto wouldn't have to.\n\nThe karma doesn't add powers or it wouldn't have made Borushiki so strong. It's more like, it uses your genes or potential to strengthen upon resurrection than your current power.",

If I remember correctly, the raikage wanted Sasuke killed but Kakashi and tsunade intervened. I say Kakashi because I think in a light novel, or the anime, Kakashi says that Sasuke would be dead if he wasn't kage. Tsunade and the other kage give Sasuke the punishment of fixing everything he's done and wiping the remains of kaguya and her influence away, and that Naruto basically owned him. If he did anything wrong or was suspicious in anyway, Naruto would have to kill him with no objections. He's basically facing the same punishment as orochimaru, only difference being that Sasuke has a little more freedom and is free to go where he wants. \n\nI can understand why Sasuke was the way he is, I just don't like him. I've never been able to really like the \"cool\" emo type of character. I don't like his design, and as anime only, his voice acting in both sub and dub was off some times and made him come off as . . . Idk. I just don't like that type of character I guess. \n\nThat explanation doesn't make any sense to me. I just don't understand the whole idea of karma. Wouldn't Naruto or hinata have gotten toneris karma (one of the few otsosuki i actually enjoyed) since they killed him? I mean that's how boruto got his.",
