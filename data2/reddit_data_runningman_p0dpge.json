It was one of those short film style MVs, and Tiny appears towards the end as a hired gun to kill KJK's MV onscreen lover. While watching the MV few months ago, I thought I know this guy and compared his tattoos. He had some hair and fewer tattoos then now.\n\nI orginally thought they met at LA concert not too long before RM started, Tiny has a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JKt1ny) with rehearsals for the concert with KJK, HaHa, Gary, 2PM, Kara etc.",
