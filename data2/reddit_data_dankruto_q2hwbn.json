Orochimaru running around in a normal Jonin outfit was way better looking that his later outfits... Something very unerving about how easy he blends in. Also loved his dynamic with Kabuto, Orochimaru wasn't actually sure if Kabuto would kill Sasuke.\n\nEveryone in team 7 was useful, yes even Sakura, and the fights weren't about how big your Jutsu were, but how tricky you could be. Within the context of Narutoverse, any win they pulled out of their ass was deserved (unlike say, Sasuke getting away from Deidara despite having almost no chakra).\n\nPost Sound invasion/timeskip is good, but damn that Pre-timeskip shit was just the best.\n\nI'm reading the manga again from start and hot damn have people forgotten quite a few things (partially bc fanfiction, like how Kakashi says that Rock Lee is a genius and it takes more than hard work to open the inner gates).",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",

Orochimaru running around in a normal Jonin outfit was way better looking that his later outfits... Something very unerving about how easy he blends in. Also loved his dynamic with Kabuto, Orochimaru wasn't actually sure if Kabuto would kill Sasuke.\n\nEveryone in team 7 was useful, yes even Sakura, and the fights weren't about how big your Jutsu were, but how tricky you could be. Within the context of Narutoverse, any win they pulled out of their ass was deserved (unlike say, Sasuke getting away from Deidara despite having almost no chakra).\n\nPost Sound invasion/timeskip is good, but damn that Pre-timeskip shit was just the best.\n\nI'm reading the manga again from start and hot damn have people forgotten quite a few things (partially bc fanfiction, like how Kakashi says that Rock Lee is a genius and it takes more than hard work to open the inner gates).",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",

Orochimaru running around in a normal Jonin outfit was way better looking that his later outfits... Something very unerving about how easy he blends in. Also loved his dynamic with Kabuto, Orochimaru wasn't actually sure if Kabuto would kill Sasuke.\n\nEveryone in team 7 was useful, yes even Sakura, and the fights weren't about how big your Jutsu were, but how tricky you could be. Within the context of Narutoverse, any win they pulled out of their ass was deserved (unlike say, Sasuke getting away from Deidara despite having almost no chakra).\n\nPost Sound invasion/timeskip is good, but damn that Pre-timeskip shit was just the best.\n\nI'm reading the manga again from start and hot damn have people forgotten quite a few things (partially bc fanfiction, like how Kakashi says that Rock Lee is a genius and it takes more than hard work to open the inner gates).",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",

Orochimaru running around in a normal Jonin outfit was way better looking that his later outfits... Something very unerving about how easy he blends in. Also loved his dynamic with Kabuto, Orochimaru wasn't actually sure if Kabuto would kill Sasuke.\n\nEveryone in team 7 was useful, yes even Sakura, and the fights weren't about how big your Jutsu were, but how tricky you could be. Within the context of Narutoverse, any win they pulled out of their ass was deserved (unlike say, Sasuke getting away from Deidara despite having almost no chakra).\n\nPost Sound invasion/timeskip is good, but damn that Pre-timeskip shit was just the best.\n\nI'm reading the manga again from start and hot damn have people forgotten quite a few things (partially bc fanfiction, like how Kakashi says that Rock Lee is a genius and it takes more than hard work to open the inner gates).",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",

Orochimaru running around in a normal Jonin outfit was way better looking that his later outfits... Something very unerving about how easy he blends in. Also loved his dynamic with Kabuto, Orochimaru wasn't actually sure if Kabuto would kill Sasuke.\n\nEveryone in team 7 was useful, yes even Sakura, and the fights weren't about how big your Jutsu were, but how tricky you could be. Within the context of Narutoverse, any win they pulled out of their ass was deserved (unlike say, Sasuke getting away from Deidara despite having almost no chakra).\n\nPost Sound invasion/timeskip is good, but damn that Pre-timeskip shit was just the best.\n\nI'm reading the manga again from start and hot damn have people forgotten quite a few things (partially bc fanfiction, like how Kakashi says that Rock Lee is a genius and it takes more than hard work to open the inner gates).",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",

There was no reason for it.\n\nThey told us people got more powerful instead of showing us how they got more powerful.\n\nNothing really changed except their age. We didn't get to see Jiraiya and Naruto bond and train, we didn't get to see Sasuke grow, we didn't get to see Sakura trian and grow. Everything in post timeskip works without the timeskip. Naruto isn't all that smarter or mature, as shown by using Sexy Jutsu in front of Sakura, he's the same guy and everyone else seemed to grow up around him.\n\nIn DB (not Z) Goku got smarter, like, straight up smarter as a fighter and it's harder to show that until the time comes. In DBZ Goku ended up having a kid. You can't have Goku v Tien and Goku v Piccolo Jr the same way without the skip and you can't have DBZ the same way w/o Gohan (which, Goku is the hero but not the main character of DBZ it feels like).\n\nSo, I'm not a fan of time skips in manga/anime unless there's a good reason. The timeskip would have been a perfect time to show Sasuke getting power fast and then end with Sasuke v Itachi... Which could end in Sasuke & Itachi v Orochimaru if you wanted to redeem Itachi (saving Sasuke from Orochimaru, which leads Sasuke to look for a swear once Orochimaru and Itachi are dead). Show Sasuke going on missions, how he gets along with Kabuto, how much evil Sasuke has to do to stay with Orochimaru, this way when we pick back up with Naruto we can either be all \"dude, let him go\" or \"Sasuke needs you, save him\" way more than how we have it at the end of pre-timeskip.",
