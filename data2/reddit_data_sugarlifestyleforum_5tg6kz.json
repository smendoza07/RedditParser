    "body": "I was having some very long conversations over Reddit PM\u2019s yesterday (seriously, my fingers are almost bleeding) and something that one of the SB\u2019s pointed out to me made me stop and give pause.\n\nShe said:\n\n> I think guys just don't get what it's like for us in the bowl. The biggest concerns you guys seem to have relate to your wallets and egos. But we have to worry about being raped, abused, scammed, stalked, disrespected, insulted, treated like objects. The stakes are just so much higher for us. \n\n> It can be really scary and nerve wracking. We feel so vulnerable. You guys are like 3x our ages and have decades of experience on us, negotiating ability, net worth, etc. The power imbalance is crazy. And women in general are used to putting other people's feelings over our own and not being assertive so we're especially at a disadvantage.\n\nShe also made a rather poignant quote from Margaret Atwood \u2014 \n\n> \"Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.\"\n\nSo this got me to thinking. As an SD I feel like I'm always bitching about the \"flakes\" the \"rinsers\" and how so many SB's are out there trying to play us. I rarely if ever \"slow my roll\" and take a step back to try to see it from the eyes of the SB sitting across from me at Starbucks - and learn what things must look like from her perspective.\n\nIs this post meant for the degenerate douchebags that treat women like shit? No. Even if I were to etch the word \"respect\" into a baseball bat and beat them with it, those ass-clowns don't care.\n\nNo, this post is directed to SD's like me. Ones that some days get frustrated with the POT that's acting so skittish and we get impatient thinking, _\"why can't she see I actually am a nice guy?!\"_. I realize it doesn't have anything to do with _me_ per-se, but the fact is that to this beautiful unicorn sitting across from me? I could just as easily be a starving lion as I could a small stuffed teddy bear spreading my little stuffed arms as wide as they can go and saying \"I like you!\"\n\nAm I saying \"Good things come to those who wait?\" Not completely ;-) That unicorn sitting across from me is gorgeous, intelligent, so full of wonder and life that if I wait too long she _will_ pick another companion. That is a given.\n\nWhat I am saying is don't go so fast you scare her off - as in \"The early bird gets the worm, but it's the second mouse that gets the cheese\" Don't be the worm, and especially don't be the _first_ mouse!\n\nSlow and steady wins the race - the race being spending time with a playful unicorn in ways that enrich both of our lives.\n\nSo if you're frustrated? I get it! Just stop. Take a deep breath, and remember to look at this whole \"dance\" from _her_ perspective every now and again. \n\nBeautiful, intelligent women are like bars of soap. They smell amazing, feel awesome against your skin, but if you squeeze too tight? That soap is gonna pop outta your hand and go flying across the bathroom. You'll shake your head and be all like \"Son of a!....\" and you're going to make a horrible mess of the place trying to get it again.\n\nSo stop squeezing so damn tight! lol!\n\n\n",

I didn't even know there was a hotel across the street.  I think it all really depends on the guy, girl and chemistry.  Even in my vanilla dating years, I struggle to recall the girls that it took more than a week to sleep with.  Usually if it was more than a week or 2, they just weren't that into me and we never dated in the first place.  But I do agree with the post about this being risky for the girl.  For the guy, it's just expensive (you can go to Maui or Europe 3-6x a year on what it takes to sugar), lose your reputation (and income, family if you have one).  But girls stand a greater chance of losing their health or life.  Thus proving that free money for something simple is never really free.",

Bills to pay, student loans to clear....likely minimal disposable income.\n\nEvery SD is doing this through pure choice, we've made our money and now we're going to splurge on a beautiful young woman....the difference could not me more stark.\n\nAt every stage of the relationship the SB is at a disadvantage and it takes a step back to realize that we have a responsibility as SD's to act accordingly.\n\n\n",

                            "body": "Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. IMHO, the quoted two paragraphs came from a very \"professional\" perspective, and were meant to manipulate.  A normal girl would not be spelling out those two paragraphs for you, as it would not deter a real scammer or rapist.  A normal girl is not likely to play her vulnerability card to a stranger; a pro would. If a normal girl actually believed what she wrote, the only rational course of action would be quitting the venue altogether; I would if I were in her shoes believing what she purports to believe. The reward/risk ratio doesn't make any sense.\n\nBTW, while she is correct that men are usually physically stronger than women, women are mentally much more capable than men when it comes to relationships and framing the other person's mind. Historically, it was probably necessary for women to use their brains to move the muscles around them.\n\nEdit: OK, the professional down-voters are afraid that their industrial secret is out in the open, may as well lay the detailed analysis out in the open, as reward for their down-voting:\n\n> I think guys just don't get what it's like for us in the bowl. \n\nThen shouldn't she find someone who gets it instead? or stop meeting guys altogether?  Why does she insist on meeting guys who don't get it? Classic industrial-grade shaming tactic to start the conversation.\n\n> The biggest concerns you guys seem to have relate to your wallets and egos. But we have to worry about being raped, abused, scammed, stalked, disrespected, insulted, treated like objects. The stakes are just so much higher for us.\n\nIf she is treating it like normal dating, why would she be encountering that long list of reactions (any more  than normal vanilla dating)?  How is risk of being raped/abused/stalked any greater in the sugar bowl than in vanilla (online) dating? given that the guy in the sugar bowl is likely to have more assets and social standing at risk than the average guy in vanilla online dating. Is she advocating parents be match makers or mandatory chaperones for all (online) dating? Why is she not if she believes those high risks. Scammed is a wallet issue; disrespected/insulted/treated like objects are ego issues.  Does she believe her ego is more important than the POT's ego? Yes she does, as she clearly stated, and she believes you should agree that her ego is more important than yours.   \n\n> It can be really scary and nerve wracking. We feel so vulnerable. \n\nThen why not get out of the sugar bowl? I'm not saying people shouldn't take precautions; however, trying to manipulate using the \"vulnerability\" card is tantamount to perverse selection: cock-blocking the \"nice guys\" while not having any effect on the less ethical. Most normal girls know that and therefore don't play the card; it's the professionals who play that card in order to exploit the men.  Most normal girls know some risks are involved just like in normal vanilla dating; that's why they find guys who are attractive enough and capable enough then stick with them. It's the professionals who talk about exorbitant risks and then keep going back into the bowl fishing for the next patron.\n\n>You guys are like 3x our ages \n\nWhy doesn't she pick someone 2x or 1.5x? 20x3=60, 25x3=75. There are plenty SD's not that old. The \"SB\" who assumes and is deliberately looking for men in their 60-75 years of age is probably a pro, as she clearly associates sex in the sugar bowl with distaste. How can she not be a pro if all she finds are men 3x her own age? and has to speak of herself in plural? as in the prostitute collective.\n\n> and have decades of experience on us, negotiating ability, net worth, etc. The power imbalance is crazy. \n\nShe probably has more sex partners in a year than he does in a decade if not a life time. The power imbalance is crazy: he is the romantic whereas she is the exploitationist; she has him by the balls.\n\n> And women in general are used to putting other people's feelings over our own and not being assertive so we're especially at a disadvantage.\n\nThe general case is not correct, unless \"other people\" means her own children. She has clearly shown that her ego is more important to her than your ego is to her . . . which is not wrong in itself, but very manipulative of her then to claim herself putting other people's feelings ahead of her own. The two paragraphs indicate at least narcissistic personality: unable to recognize other people's feelings. Could be a BPD chronicle liar as well. An attractive girl finding relatively easy success in the sugar bowl wouldn't have the dire thoughts or first-hand experience to share with you. ",

If people think they don't exist in the bowl then they are not living in reality. Put it differently there are many SDs who totally have their act together in life, great education, great career, a family and social status and a wrong association can quickly ruin that in an instant not just for them but for their reputations and families.

It is not that uncommon and we are putting ourselves out there in a world where typical predators might roam SA for just this reason; finding a victim. So be sympathetic, just like unprotected sex- I still do not like risking the low chance of getting HIV or the uncurable diseases. Health and safety are first. Prefer that over pissing off a man who gets insulted that I want to make sure he is not in the low percentage of criminals. Any percentage regarding my life is too high. ",

Police reports are found to be close to 50:50.\n\nI have been told personal rape stories a few times in my life, and every single time it's a girl who was about to cheat on me, or lie to me in order to get more money than original agreement, or just disappear after receiving money; i.e. scamming/rinsing. Every, single, time, regardless whether I had met the girl only that week or had been with that girl for more than a year. It's as if there were some kind of warrior's honor code of not revealing past rape victimhood until they have their knives out for you.\n\nI'm not at all exaggerating about this, the correlation has been 100%!  Nowadays, if someone tells me her past rape victimhood, I'd clutch at my wallet and make sure it's still there.",

Just like she could care a super rats ass on how hard I work to make my money or how tough it was to seal the last deal at work or that I cut of another important meeting to go see her. My responsibility is to treat her right period. Treating people as people should not be hailed as great! Your post has a meaning and it's good to be aware but I won't give anyone extra points for being an SB! It's done by choice and that entails having to deal with the pros and cons just like how they exist as part of all things in life - work, marriage, relationships, business etc! Ask entrepreneurs who have raised money and they will tell you how many investors flaked and faked and wasted their time etc until the right deal came along.

The fact I don't always do this when sitting across from an SB is actually something I need to work on - because I recognize its value.\n\n> There are another 10 - 30 million women in the same age bracket with same or better looks and similar financial circumstances who choose to do multiple jobs, go to school at night, cut corners, make sacrifices or whatever it takes to survive and thrive without resorting to sugaring or any other means.\n\nYeah. Now I am going to say this, and please, read it slowly so it sinks in - _I can and will always try to empathize with anyone regardless of situation_  **however** what I am talking about here is having a modicum of empathy _for the woman sitting across from you at the !@#$ table of a M&G_. Whether you feel that is worth the effort or not is entirely _up to you_. \n\nThe simple fact is, anyone who makes the choice to empathize _will have a lot better chance_ of having an intimate time with said woman you are trying to be with. Why are you debating this simple point?\n\nI don't care if it's an SR Meet and Greet, or a date from someone I met in my vanilla life - the woman sitting across from me at the dinner table has a lot more to fear from me than I do about her. Why is this so difficult to understand? Because they are choosing to be there? Well **so what**! What the Hell does that have anything to do as to whether or not I should feel some empathy?",

If someone wants to be an SB, odds are they will have to put in the work and go through the drill. Why empathize or feel great if one does! That's the path chosen and they know the payoffs of success. It's a choice. As a young entrepreneur I remember a lot of doors got slammed on me. I was invited to many frivolous meet and greets. Many prospects would back out at the last minute.  Many said they would fund but never came through. There were enough but subtle attempts to rob the idea I had.  Hey it's all part of the game. I never expected my investors to empathize! And most never did. My goal was to get funded and I knew I had a great idea and that the right investor was around the corner. The investors could care less if I had skipped lunch or put in an all nighter on the pitch or that my coder just quit on me. I know different situations but similar principles. I am sure there will be reasons to disagree with my points and that's ok. ",

For the guy, it's just expensive (you can go to Maui or Europe 3-6x a year on what it takes to sugar), lose your reputation (and income, family if you have one).  But girls stand a greater chance of losing their health or life.  Thus proving that free money for something simple is never really free.",

                    "body": "Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. IMHO, the quoted two paragraphs came from a very \"professional\" perspective, and were meant to manipulate.  A normal girl would not be spelling out those two paragraphs for you, as it would not deter a real scammer or rapist.  A normal girl is not likely to play her vulnerability card to a stranger; a pro would. If a normal girl actually believed what she wrote, the only rational course of action would be quitting the venue altogether; I would if I were in her shoes believing what she purports to believe. The reward/risk ratio doesn't make any sense.\n\nBTW, while she is correct that men are usually physically stronger than women, women are mentally much more capable than men when it comes to relationships and framing the other person's mind. Historically, it was probably necessary for women to use their brains to move the muscles around them.\n\nEdit: OK, the professional down-voters are afraid that their industrial secret is out in the open, may as well lay the detailed analysis out in the open, as reward for their down-voting:\n\n> I think guys just don't get what it's like for us in the bowl. \n\nThen shouldn't she find someone who gets it instead? or stop meeting guys altogether?  Why does she insist on meeting guys who don't get it? Classic industrial-grade shaming tactic to start the conversation.\n\n> The biggest concerns you guys seem to have relate to your wallets and egos. But we have to worry about being raped, abused, scammed, stalked, disrespected, insulted, treated like objects. The stakes are just so much higher for us.\n\nIf she is treating it like normal dating, why would she be encountering that long list of reactions (any more  than normal vanilla dating)?  How is risk of being raped/abused/stalked any greater in the sugar bowl than in vanilla (online) dating? given that the guy in the sugar bowl is likely to have more assets and social standing at risk than the average guy in vanilla online dating. Is she advocating parents be match makers or mandatory chaperones for all (online) dating? Why is she not if she believes those high risks. Scammed is a wallet issue; disrespected/insulted/treated like objects are ego issues.  Does she believe her ego is more important than the POT's ego? Yes she does, as she clearly stated, and she believes you should agree that her ego is more important than yours.   \n\n> It can be really scary and nerve wracking. We feel so vulnerable. \n\nThen why not get out of the sugar bowl? I'm not saying people shouldn't take precautions; however, trying to manipulate using the \"vulnerability\" card is tantamount to perverse selection: cock-blocking the \"nice guys\" while not having any effect on the less ethical. Most normal girls know that and therefore don't play the card; it's the professionals who play that card in order to exploit the men.  Most normal girls know some risks are involved just like in normal vanilla dating; that's why they find guys who are attractive enough and capable enough then stick with them. It's the professionals who talk about exorbitant risks and then keep going back into the bowl fishing for the next patron.\n\n>You guys are like 3x our ages \n\nWhy doesn't she pick someone 2x or 1.5x? 20x3=60, 25x3=75. There are plenty SD's not that old. The \"SB\" who assumes and is deliberately looking for men in their 60-75 years of age is probably a pro, as she clearly associates sex in the sugar bowl with distaste. How can she not be a pro if all she finds are men 3x her own age? and has to speak of herself in plural? as in the prostitute collective.\n\n> and have decades of experience on us, negotiating ability, net worth, etc. The power imbalance is crazy. \n\nShe probably has more sex partners in a year than he does in a decade if not a life time. The power imbalance is crazy: he is the romantic whereas she is the exploitationist; she has him by the balls.\n\n> And women in general are used to putting other people's feelings over our own and not being assertive so we're especially at a disadvantage.\n\nThe general case is not correct, unless \"other people\" means her own children. She has clearly shown that her ego is more important to her than your ego is to her . . . which is not wrong in itself, but very manipulative of her then to claim herself putting other people's feelings ahead of her own. The two paragraphs indicate at least narcissistic personality: unable to recognize other people's feelings. Could be a BPD chronicle liar as well. An attractive girl finding relatively easy success in the sugar bowl wouldn't have the dire thoughts or first-hand experience to share with you. ",

If people think they don't exist in the bowl then they are not living in reality. Put it differently there are many SDs who totally have their act together in life, great education, great career, a family and social status and a wrong association can quickly ruin that in an instant not just for them but for their reputations and families. So back to empathy, no need. Be nice and be respectful. All of us are best advised to be safe and follow our instincts! There is no need to kiss up to the SB community and say we empathize!

It is not that uncommon and we are putting ourselves out there in a world where typical predators might roam SA for just this reason; finding a victim.

My responsibility is to treat her right period. Treating people as people should not be hailed as great! Your post has a meaning and it's good to be aware but I won't give anyone extra points for being an SB! It's done by choice and that entails having to deal with the pros and cons just like how they exist as part of all things in life - work, marriage, relationships, business etc! Ask entrepreneurs who have raised money and they will tell you how many investors flaked and faked and wasted their time etc until the right deal came along.

Even moreso. \n\nJust because THEY picked to be there, doesn't mean you can't appreciate they are there, sitting in front of you, and taking more of a risk than if they were as you said, \"_do multiple jobs, go to school at night, cut corners, make sacrifices or whatever it takes to survive and thrive without resorting to sugaring_\"?\n\nIf it wasn't for them moving through their fears at that moment to be with you at an M&G? You wouldn't even be here discussing any of this. ",

I never expected my investors to empathize! And most never did. My goal was to get funded and I knew I had a great idea and that the right investor was around the corner.

Usually if it was more than a week or 2, they just weren't that into me and we never dated in the first place.  But I do agree with the post about this being risky for the girl.  For the guy, it's just expensive (you can go to Maui or Europe 3-6x a year on what it takes to sugar), lose your reputation (and income, family if you have one).  But girls stand a greater chance of losing their health or life.  Thus proving that free money for something simple is never really free.",

            "body": "Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. IMHO, the quoted two paragraphs came from a very \"professional\" perspective, and were meant to manipulate.  A normal girl would not be spelling out those two paragraphs for you, as it would not deter a real scammer or rapist.  A normal girl is not likely to play her vulnerability card to a stranger; a pro would. If a normal girl actually believed what she wrote, the only rational course of action would be quitting the venue altogether; I would if I were in her shoes believing what she purports to believe. The reward/risk ratio doesn't make any sense.\n\nBTW, while she is correct that men are usually physically stronger than women, women are mentally much more capable than men when it comes to relationships and framing the other person's mind. Historically, it was probably necessary for women to use their brains to move the muscles around them.\n\nEdit: OK, the professional down-voters are afraid that their industrial secret is out in the open, may as well lay the detailed analysis out in the open, as reward for their down-voting:\n\n> I think guys just don't get what it's like for us in the bowl. \n\nThen shouldn't she find someone who gets it instead? or stop meeting guys altogether?  Why does she insist on meeting guys who don't get it? Classic industrial-grade shaming tactic to start the conversation.\n\n> The biggest concerns you guys seem to have relate to your wallets and egos. But we have to worry about being raped, abused, scammed, stalked, disrespected, insulted, treated like objects. The stakes are just so much higher for us.\n\nIf she is treating it like normal dating, why would she be encountering that long list of reactions (any more  than normal vanilla dating)?  How is risk of being raped/abused/stalked any greater in the sugar bowl than in vanilla (online) dating? given that the guy in the sugar bowl is likely to have more assets and social standing at risk than the average guy in vanilla online dating. Is she advocating parents be match makers or mandatory chaperones for all (online) dating? Why is she not if she believes those high risks. Scammed is a wallet issue; disrespected/insulted/treated like objects are ego issues.  Does she believe her ego is more important than the POT's ego? Yes she does, as she clearly stated, and she believes you should agree that her ego is more important than yours.   \n\n> It can be really scary and nerve wracking. We feel so vulnerable. \n\nThen why not get out of the sugar bowl? I'm not saying people shouldn't take precautions; however, trying to manipulate using the \"vulnerability\" card is tantamount to perverse selection: cock-blocking the \"nice guys\" while not having any effect on the less ethical. Most normal girls know that and therefore don't play the card; it's the professionals who play that card in order to exploit the men.  Most normal girls know some risks are involved just like in normal vanilla dating; that's why they find guys who are attractive enough and capable enough then stick with them. It's the professionals who talk about exorbitant risks and then keep going back into the bowl fishing for the next patron.\n\n>You guys are like 3x our ages \n\nWhy doesn't she pick someone 2x or 1.5x? 20x3=60, 25x3=75. There are plenty SD's not that old. The \"SB\" who assumes and is deliberately looking for men in their 60-75 years of age is probably a pro, as she clearly associates sex in the sugar bowl with distaste. How can she not be a pro if all she finds are men 3x her own age? and has to speak of herself in plural? as in the prostitute collective.\n\n> and have decades of experience on us, negotiating ability, net worth, etc. The power imbalance is crazy. \n\nShe probably has more sex partners in a year than he does in a decade if not a life time. The power imbalance is crazy: he is the romantic whereas she is the exploitationist; she has him by the balls.\n\n> And women in general are used to putting other people's feelings over our own and not being assertive so we're especially at a disadvantage.\n\nThe general case is not correct, unless \"other people\" means her own children. She has clearly shown that her ego is more important to her than your ego is to her . . . which is not wrong in itself, but very manipulative of her then to claim herself putting other people's feelings ahead of her own. The two paragraphs indicate at least narcissistic personality: unable to recognize other people's feelings. Could be a BPD chronicle liar as well. An attractive girl finding relatively easy success in the sugar bowl wouldn't have the dire thoughts or first-hand experience to share with you. ",

Too bad and very sad that such basic and normal behavior amounts to being the \"knight in shining armor \" in sugar land. Do I care where the SB is coming from or how many douche bags she has dated before she landed across the table from me. NO. That's her problem and not mine. Just like she could care a super rats ass on how hard I work to make my money or how tough it was to seal the last deal at work or that I cut of another important meeting to go see her. My responsibility is to treat her right period. Treating people as people should not be hailed as great! Your post has a meaning and it's good to be aware but I won't give anyone extra points for being an SB! It's done by choice and that entails having to deal with the pros and cons just like how they exist as part of all things in life - work, marriage, relationships, business etc! Ask entrepreneurs who have raised money and they will tell you how many investors flaked and faked and wasted their time etc until the right deal came along. So sorry no brownie points for SBs!!! \n",

Even moreso. \n\nJust because THEY picked to be there, doesn't mean you can't appreciate they are there, sitting in front of you, and taking more of a risk than if they were as you said, \"_do multiple jobs, go to school at night, cut corners, make sacrifices or whatever it takes to survive and thrive without resorting to sugaring_\"?\n\nIf it wasn't for them moving through their fears at that moment to be with you at an M&G?

Even moreso. \n\nJust because THEY picked to be there, doesn't mean you can't appreciate they are there, sitting in front of you, and taking more of a risk than if they were as you said, \"_do multiple jobs, go to school at night, cut corners, make sacrifices or whatever it takes to survive and thrive without resorting to sugaring_\"?\n\nIf it wasn't for them moving through their fears at that moment to be with you at an M&G?

The fact I don't always do this when sitting across from an SB is actually something I need to work on - because I recognize its value.\n\n> There are another 10 - 30 million women in the same age bracket with same or better looks and similar financial circumstances who choose to do multiple jobs, go to school at night, cut corners, make sacrifices or whatever it takes to survive and thrive without resorting to sugaring or any other means.\n\nYeah. Now I am going to say this, and please, read it slowly so it sinks in - _I can and will always try to empathize with anyone regardless of situation_  **however** what I am talking about here is having a modicum of empathy _for the woman sitting across from you at the !@#$ table of a M&G_. Whether you feel that is worth the effort or not is entirely _up to you_. \n\nThe simple fact is, anyone who makes the choice to empathize _will have a lot better chance_ of having an intimate time with said woman you are trying to be with. Why are you debating this simple point?\n\nI don't care if it's an SR Meet and Greet, or a date from someone I met in my vanilla life - the woman sitting across from me at the dinner table has a lot more to fear from me than I do about her. Why is this so difficult to understand? Because they are choosing to be there? Well **so what**! What the Hell does that have anything to do as to whether or not I should feel some empathy?",

Why empathize or feel great if one does! That's the path chosen and they know the payoffs of success. It's a choice. As a young entrepreneur I remember a lot of doors got slammed on me. I was invited to many frivolous meet and greets. Many prospects would back out at the last minute.  Many said they would fund but never came through. There were enough but subtle attempts to rob the idea I had.  Hey it's all part of the game. I never expected my investors to empathize! And most never did. My goal was to get funded and I knew I had a great idea and that the right investor was around the corner. The investors could care less if I had skipped lunch or put in an all nighter on the pitch or that my coder just quit on me. I know different situations but similar principles. I am sure there will be reasons to disagree with my points and that's ok. ",

The fact I don't always do this when sitting across from an SB is actually something I need to work on - because I recognize its value.\n\n> There are another 10 - 30 million women in the same age bracket with same or better looks and similar financial circumstances who choose to do multiple jobs, go to school at night, cut corners, make sacrifices or whatever it takes to survive and thrive without resorting to sugaring or any other means.\n\nYeah. Now I am going to say this, and please, read it slowly so it sinks in - _I can and will always try to empathize with anyone regardless of situation_  **however** what I am talking about here is having a modicum of empathy _for the woman sitting across from you at the !@#$ table of a M&G_. Whether you feel that is worth the effort or not is entirely _up to you_. \n\nThe simple fact is, anyone who makes the choice to empathize _will have a lot better chance_ of having an intimate time with said woman you are trying to be with. Why are you debating this simple point?\n\nI don't care if it's an SR Meet and Greet, or a date from someone I met in my vanilla life - the woman sitting across from me at the dinner table has a lot more to fear from me than I do about her. Why is this so difficult to understand? Because they are choosing to be there? Well **so what**! What the Hell does that have anything to do as to whether or not I should feel some empathy?",

He knows I'm not good with expressing my emotions in person, so if it means he gets more out of me via text he will. ",
