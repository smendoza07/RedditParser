Short hair doesn't magically look better on dudes because it's short, people just cling to their preconceived notions about what long hair says about someone compared to short.\n\nThere is one noted improvement, and it's not in the length of your hair, it's in the addition of volume. If anything, I'd say *that* was the issue when your hair was long, that it was laying flat on your head. Take that same hairstyle and ignore that there's anything coming down off the sides, crop the image if it helps you imagine it, and you'll see the equivalent of a bad combover--all while still being short! Clearly, length wasn't the issue.\n\nIt's actually a common issue among those with curly hair who grow it out, colloquially referred to as the dreaded triangle hair.\n\ntl,dr; Length wasn't the problem, and if r/mha care about actually giving advice rather than pushing short hair on people and nothing but, they would've given you recommendations to address what was: flat hair.",

Short hair doesn't magically look better on dudes because it's short, people just cling to their preconceived notions about what long hair says about someone compared to short.\n\nThere is one noted improvement, and it's not in the length of your hair, it's in the addition of volume. If anything, I'd say *that* was the issue when your hair was long, that it was laying flat on your head. Take that same hairstyle and ignore that there's anything coming down off the sides, crop the image if it helps you imagine it, and you'll see the equivalent of a bad combover--all while still being short! Clearly, length wasn't the issue.\n\nIt's actually a common issue among those with curly hair who grow it out, colloquially referred to as the dreaded triangle hair.\n\ntl,dr; Length wasn't the problem, and if r/mha care about actually giving advice rather than pushing short hair on people and nothing but, they would've given you recommendations to address what was: flat hair.",

Short hair doesn't magically look better on dudes because it's short, people just cling to their preconceived notions about what long hair says about someone compared to short.\n\nThere is one noted improvement, and it's not in the length of your hair, it's in the addition of volume. If anything, I'd say *that* was the issue when your hair was long, that it was laying flat on your head. Take that same hairstyle and ignore that there's anything coming down off the sides, crop the image if it helps you imagine it, and you'll see the equivalent of a bad combover--all while still being short! Clearly, length wasn't the issue.\n\nIt's actually a common issue among those with curly hair who grow it out, colloquially referred to as the dreaded triangle hair.\n\ntl,dr; Length wasn't the problem, and if r/mha care about actually giving advice rather than pushing short hair on people and nothing but, they would've given you recommendations to address what was: flat hair.",
