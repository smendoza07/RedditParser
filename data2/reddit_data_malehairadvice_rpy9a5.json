So the comments I made are totally spot on.  Then again if you don't have hair it is generally because you chose not to mess with it.  It has little to do with my general male anatomy.  However your comments are showing you are such.  The typical rule of thumb still fits here: If you can't or don't or won't care for your hair and cut it off it generally shows you don't want to fuss or mess with it and are lazy.  This is 100% accurate as well.",

However your comments are showing you are such.  The typical rule of thumb still fits here: If you can't or don't or won't care for your hair and cut it off it generally shows you don't want to fuss or mess with it and are lazy.  This is 100% accurate as well.",
