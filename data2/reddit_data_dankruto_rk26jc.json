Which cancels out anything supernatural, which Madara is. Now you could make the argument of \"the Geass\" being able to command himself to not die via Imagine Breaker but guess what, the Geass is supernatrual too so it doesn't matter. And thus, his very existence would disappear.\n\nBut let's pretend it doesn't do that. So the only left is really Popeye's spinach(which totally works like regular spinach, defintely). He could fold anyone but at that point, he's actually touchable. Or alternatively, Temari could probably blow that spinach out of his hand before he could anything and therefore anything stronger or faster or any skilled wind style user than her would be able to touch Madara if they don't let him consume that spinach. Which would include but not limited to:\n\n* Naruto\n* Sasuke\n* Sakura\n* Kakashi\n* Gaara\n* Choji\n* Lee\n* Neji\n* Tenten (with her So6p fan thing)\n* Might Guy\n* Obito\n* Black Zetsu\n* Kaguya\n\nand lastly, my left nut.

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

Which cancels out anything supernatural, which Madara is. Now you could make the argument of \"the Geass\" being able to command himself to not die via Imagine Breaker but guess what, the Geass is supernatrual too so it doesn't matter. And thus, his very existence would disappear.\n\nBut let's pretend it doesn't do that. So the only left is really Popeye's spinach(which totally works like regular spinach, defintely). He could fold anyone but at that point, he's actually touchable. Or alternatively, Temari could probably blow that spinach out of his hand before he could anything and therefore anything stronger or faster or any skilled wind style user than her would be able to touch Madara if they don't let him consume that spinach. Which would include but not limited to:\n\n* Naruto\n* Sasuke\n* Sakura\n* Kakashi\n* Gaara\n* Choji\n* Lee\n* Neji\n* Tenten (with her So6p fan thing)\n* Might Guy\n* Obito\n* Black Zetsu\n* Kaguya\n\nand lastly, my left nut.

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

Which cancels out anything supernatural, which Madara is. Now you could make the argument of \"the Geass\" being able to command himself to not die via Imagine Breaker but guess what, the Geass is supernatrual too so it doesn't matter. And thus, his very existence would disappear.\n\nBut let's pretend it doesn't do that. So the only left is really Popeye's spinach(which totally works like regular spinach, defintely). He could fold anyone but at that point, he's actually touchable. Or alternatively, Temari could probably blow that spinach out of his hand before he could anything and therefore anything stronger or faster or any skilled wind style user than her would be able to touch Madara if they don't let him consume that spinach. Which would include but not limited to:\n\n* Naruto\n* Sasuke\n* Sakura\n* Kakashi\n* Gaara\n* Choji\n* Lee\n* Neji\n* Tenten (with her So6p fan thing)\n* Might Guy\n* Obito\n* Black Zetsu\n* Kaguya\n\nand lastly, my left nut.

The thing is when this is the only thing you did in the entire War and then people go out and say she did more than Hinata in the War. Also problem comes when people use this to judge her and say she is very good and that she will defeat every other character like she threw away Madara.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

Temari is cool, her weapon is Hella sick, her skill in wind style is unique, so what's wrong with her getting a shot at Madara?",

This is the only thing she did in the entire War Arc and its filler. And her battle with Tenten is also filler. We never saw what Temari can do. All we know about Temaris that she has a fan and uses it. \n\nNothing wrong in making a female look cool. The thing is when this is the only thing you did in the entire War and then people go out and say she did more than Hinata in the War. Also problem comes when people use this to judge her and say she is very good and that she will defeat every other character like she threw away Madara.",

Just plain old sucks.\n\n\nBoruto had potential to expand the world of Naruto.\n\n\nHell naruto shouldn't be alive when boruto happens. It shouldn't even be about his son, what about making it about a few generations after them? Make the world futuristic and look cool, make Naruto die tragically and the whole ninja world imploding, I dunno. So much fucking ideas and nothing.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

Temari is cool, her weapon is Hella sick, her skill in wind style is unique, so what's wrong with her getting a shot at Madara?",

The thing is when this is the only thing you did in the entire War and then people go out and say she did more than Hinata in the War. Also problem comes when people use this to judge her and say she is very good and that she will defeat every other character like she threw away Madara.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",

The big boobs you are talking about are hidden under her baggy clothes. Where do you see big boobs [here](https://mangalist.online/images/i05VIXTpBGt3a6vhIj8L1606322120.jpg) where she combines TLF and 64 palms? Lol she gave up her shyness way before. Where was she shy in Pain Arc and War Arc? Simp over Naruto? It's called admiration. Its sad that Sakura and Ino simped over Sasuke in chunin exams so now Hinata is thrown in that category too when [she just wanted to change herself](https://static1.mangayeh.com/manga/chapter/60191e3aa566934fb06d15a1/60197915786df83d337d7dd2/naruto_80_18.jpg) not simp over Naruto. Liking a female character doesn't make you a simp sorry. And she did more in War tham most male characters. Temari is nothing bad ass, most of her showing are fillers just like her hitting Madara. So your opinion is valid but not my opinion and its not even an opinion its a fact that Hinata did more in War than Temari. When you forget what certain characters did, then you need a list to be reminded of those things like you are forgetting.",
