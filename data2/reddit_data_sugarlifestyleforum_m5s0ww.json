    "body": "I\u2019ll make this long story short. \n\nMet a man on SA who first reached out to me. We exchanged numbers (my Google number) today and started chatting. \n\nMan stated he worked for Disney, now works typically Tues and Thurs. He said he was looking for a companion, blah blah blah and offered $xxxx each week to meet. \n\nSo we start talking specifics- what days work etc. \n\nFirst red flag is he wanted to meet my daughter this week. Bro, no. \n\n(Some advice on whether I should disclose I have a daughter would be appreciated. Typically I won\u2019t but I figured I would this time.)\n\nSecond red flag, he send me pics of himself in a bedroom with a bathroom door right at his feet (what man who\u2019s worth as much as he stated lives in a studio.) \n\nI should\u2019ve called him out but I didn\u2019t. (We video chatted on What\u2019sapp and I saw he had one pillow, in that one bedroom and just eww. \n\nWhen he asked to start our \u201crelationship\u201d with me tomorrow (he lives in Orlando, I live in Tampa) I said yes, so long as we agree upon the $xxxx/ week and I can see him twice a week every time. \n\nHe says \u201coh. You don\u2019t want a real relationship? I saw you differently than SA. I was treating this as if we met on Bumble\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd22 \n\nMe: \u201cBut we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nHim: \u201cSorry it appears we\u2019re on two different wavelengths. I\u2019m going to have to pass.\u201d\n\nI go to block him on SA and he already did it. \n\nJust a rant. \nThis poor man. (No pun intended but perfectly fitting)",

I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine.

However - let me key you in on a more important tag line of Seeking:\n\n\"Relationship on your terms\".\n\nSeeking is a dating site.  It's NOT vanilla dating.  But it is a dating site.  \n\nI respect that there is a wide audience in sugaring - and there is not a one style fits all.  For example - I primarily prefer doing monthly allowance, not PPM.  Based on your post history - I\"m going to guess we are at other ends of the sugar spectrum.  That's fine, but that's also the context with which I write this.\n\n>  then Bumble IS a better place\n\nI've been using Seeking for well over 4 years now.  I've had a number of relationships, including several SGFs.",

I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine.

However - let me key you in on a more important tag line of Seeking:\n\n\"Relationship on your terms\".\n\nSeeking is a dating site.  It's NOT vanilla dating.  But it is a dating site.  \n\nI respect that there is a wide audience in sugaring - and there is not a one style fits all.  For example - I primarily prefer doing monthly allowance, not PPM.  Based on your post history - I\"m going to guess we are at other ends of the sugar spectrum.  That's fine, but that's also the context with which I write this.\n\n>  then Bumble IS a better place\n\nI've been using Seeking for well over 4 years now.

I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids.

The vast majority of abuse of children is done by men who are known to them, not by random strangers.  \n\nIf a man wanted to abuse a random kid, he would just go to a park, or a school, or wherever.  He's not going to meet a woman on a dating app and then say \"hey, let me follow her home and abuse her child\". This simply defies common sense.",

But also, this may shock you to imagine, men can do those things to her kids knowing that she has less recourse than an average woman legally because he can use proof against her that she is selling sex. That stuff can absolutely get your kids taken away entirely. Like yea this is hypothetical but also some of us have been through similar situations or know sex workers who have. I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine. I wouldn't even let them be in the house overnight with my boyfriend until LONG into the relationship. Too many of us have witnessed or experienced too much child abuse to write this stuff off as ridiculous. I guess you don't get that mothering instinct thing.",

But also, this may shock you to imagine, men can do those things to her kids knowing that she has less recourse than an average woman legally because he can use proof against her that she is selling sex. That stuff can absolutely get your kids taken away entirely. Like yea this is hypothetical but also some of us have been through similar situations or know sex workers who have. I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine. I wouldn't even let them be in the house overnight with my boyfriend until LONG into the relationship. Too many of us have witnessed or experienced too much child abuse to write this stuff off as ridiculous. I guess you don't get that mothering instinct thing.",

The vast majority of abuse of children is done by men who are known to them, not by random strangers.  \n\nIf a man wanted to abuse a random kid, he would just go to a park, or a school, or wherever.  He's not going to meet a woman on a dating app and then say \"hey, let me follow her home and abuse her child\". This simply defies common sense.",

But also, this may shock you to imagine, men can do those things to her kids knowing that she has less recourse than an average woman legally because he can use proof against her that she is selling sex. That stuff can absolutely get your kids taken away entirely. Like yea this is hypothetical but also some of us have been through similar situations or know sex workers who have. I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine. I wouldn't even let them be in the house overnight with my boyfriend until LONG into the relationship. Too many of us have witnessed or experienced too much child abuse to write this stuff off as ridiculous. I guess you don't get that mothering instinct thing.",

But also, this may shock you to imagine, men can do those things to her kids knowing that she has less recourse than an average woman legally because he can use proof against her that she is selling sex. That stuff can absolutely get your kids taken away entirely. Like yea this is hypothetical but also some of us have been through similar situations or know sex workers who have. I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine. I wouldn't even let them be in the house overnight with my boyfriend until LONG into the relationship. Too many of us have witnessed or experienced too much child abuse to write this stuff off as ridiculous. I guess you don't get that mothering instinct thing.",

I can't count the number of women I knew in the strip club fighting custody battles with men who were previously ok with them stripping but used it as a weapon against them to get their kids. All of these things may seem far fetched but they suddenly become extremely precarious when you're facing down the real thing and examining all these possibilities with your own kids.   \n\n\nHonestly I cannot imagine willingly letting an SD meet any children of mine.
