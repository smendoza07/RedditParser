The peeps here told me to buzz my hair, and so I did. And it was amazing. I eventually took a razor to my dome, after more people suggested that. \n\nAt first I was a little hesitant, because I didn't know if it was just hype. But I took the plunge, and I have never felt more confident in my life. \n\nThe point is, someone told me in the comments \"it looks like your hanging on to someone you don't event have\", and that hit me hard. For you, I'd say buzz it closer. What you have now is such an improvement to what you had, but it still looks like you are somewhere in between where you should be.",
