It\u2019s like that for women *every time.* A lot of men take that for granted and it shows. Wouldn\u2019t kill you to know how it actually feels. Might even be good for you.\n\n2. You\u2019ll probably like it. Men have a clit in their butthole (prostate). If you\u2019re not exploring that, you\u2019re an utter fool. Imagine having a clit and never once touching it to see how it feels. Ridiculous.\n\n3. What reason do you have not to? Because it\u2019s \u201cgay\u201d? Not if you do it with a woman. Because she\u2019s in a more dominant role? It\u2019s called gender equality, welcome to 2021. Because it makes you less of a man? If all it takes is one sex act to derail your manhood, you weren\u2019t one to start with. Let go of any/all outdated excuses and lighten up.\n\n4. Don\u2019t be boring.",
