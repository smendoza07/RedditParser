    "body": "Genuine question. Have you truly thought about why your wife no longer wants to have sex with you? If so, why?\n\nDont get me wrong, medical issues and menopause can be a very plausible explanations and maybe helps you sleep a little better at night knowing \\*phew, IM not the issue\\*, however... there are certainly more variables to take into consideration that influence sexual desire in women in many other situations. Heres a great example: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382213/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382213/)\n\nI have observed enough wife blaming here to consider this question, and lets not forget: it takes two to tango. Have you considered your role in her desire (or lack there of)?\n\nConversations that inspired this question: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/tg8cf3/married\\_sds\\_who\\_have\\_a\\_good\\_relationship\\_and\\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/tg8cf3/married_sds_who_have_a_good_relationship_and_are/) \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/rdaupc/do\\_married\\_sugar\\_daddies\\_feel\\_gulity\\_with\\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/rdaupc/do_married_sugar_daddies_feel_gulity_with_their/)\n\n (notice how no one mentions their own role, just the wife's \"deficiency\")\n\nSo, besides those with the explanation of medical issues, why is your bedroom dead? Im curious.\n\n(Also: SBs who have experienced a dead bedroom, what were your experiences and what lead to that? Why didnt you want to have sex?)\n\nCheers :-)",

            "body": "I personally think that for a lot of men who focus only on providing they end up treating there wife like a mom or caretaker, expecting them to take care of every other little part of there life other than their own job. \n\nIf your wife is treating you like a child who goes off to work every day and then taking care of everything else.. what is sexy about that? \n\nNo wonder so many woman loose attraction. And I would say a large amount of men have no idea what the ins and outs of running and managing (especially one with kids!) a household really entails. \n\nThe classic \u2018well you just need to tell me what to do or give me a list\u2019 they say that innocently and but fail to realize that by saying that you have no understanding of how things in the household work, you are not being a responsible partner who understands the mental and emotional labour the wife goes through, you are becoming an underling who she has to manage and tell what to do, who doesn\u2019t understand the true extent of her work load so it and she goes unappreciated. What is sexy about that from the woman\u2019s perspective? NOTHING! \n \nMen who were coddled by there mothers typically then go on to end up pushing that same expectation onto their wives. They have no idea what it takes to keep up that level of care and they never will if they manage to always find a woman to take care of them.",

I myself have experienced exactly what I am talking about and as you can see other woman agree with me. \n\nExactly what I describe is why I stopped vanilla dating and turned to strictly sugar dating. \n\nI gave and gave and did everything I did to support my ex partner and when ever I needed a little bit of support back I had no help. I was essentially taking care of a whole household on my own. Eventually he lots his job and I was the sole provider financially and responsible for the home with NO help. The man that you think in \u2018insulting\u2019 took my debit card from my purse and would take out cash sneakily. Drink and eat anything I bought for myself and left in the fridge. Go through my phone while I\u2019m sleeping thinking that I\u2019m cheating when I wasn\u2019t. All while he was giving NOTHING and taking EVERYTHING from me. I put locks on everything and was trying to wait until the lease was up in a month and I could resign on my own. The landlord wouldn\u2019t let me take him or of the lease early. He eventually chocked me until I was unconscious because I took his phone as payment for cash he stole from me because I fell sleep with a door unlocked. I had him arrested for the assault and the same day he was released he tried to break into my house. I had to leave my home and city to feel safe again. \n\nI know what I\u2019m talking about, maybe you should too before you call someone a hypocrite because you feel called out. \n\n\nBtw way I didn\u2019t say that men are entitled.. you did. \n\nIn fact I don\u2019t blame men at all. I blame our culture, the culture that effects both genders and is not mutually exclusive to either one. Men may be perpetuating the behaviour that I\u2019m describing but I also call out their mothers that helped in-still this behaviour in childhood. Both genders play a role and it\u2019s unproductive to blame either one. \n\nWhy don\u2019t YOU take your shit else were. \n\nLooks like I hit a nerve..

But there's little room for jealousy, just a whole lot of honesty. You have to talk about the hard stuff and it really bonds me with people.\n\nP.s. I had the worst day at work and am jealous my SBF (LDR) is with a casual partner of his, so...it happens. I didn't know they had a date and got upset when I heard her voice(still told him he didn't do anything wrong I just was having feelings and feeling left out of the loop). He did tell me they were prob getting together this weekend and I forgot about it). Then I called to apologize bc I didn't want it to be in the back of his mind since I knew he was panicky and hadn't wanted to get off the phone but I didn't want his date waiting on him. I apologized and he apologized for contributing to how I felt and said we would work out a plan and make sure that didn't happen. Chances are we will use slack and/or Google calendar. Thanks, I really just needed to get that off my chest. \n\nI'm still gonna coyly suggest he send me a present to help me feel better. Hmmm...what to ask for...",

I actually thought for a moment I had ED and I was in my 30's. Once I stopped, my brain re-wired itself back to normal. A single woman cannot possibly replicate the mental stimulation of being able to watch short clips of multiple videos. A lot of porn sites also have those compilations which have to be the worst of them all. Once I realized what was happening, I stopped. I think if a man can't stop, then he has  problem because now he's literally addicted to the dopamine release. My theory anyway, sample size of one, myself and of course talking to my male friends here and there.",

            "body": "There are some people here that want to understand. And some who want to condemn. This is for the people who want to understand.\n\nFirst, unless you have been married for 20+ years, you don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s like trying to explain to a man what it\u2019s like to deal with misogyny on a daily basis. He tries to oversimplify it, \u201cit must be nice to get free drinks at bars\u201d. \u201cAre you saying men are bad or good?\u201d \u201cAre you saying a specific guy is a misogynist or not?\u201d All ridiculous questions which try to break down a complex issue into yes or no.\n\nRelationships are unique. They are made up of people with complex feelings, issues, needs and wants. People are capable of great love, selfishness, anger and pain. They can be self-destructive and self-sacrificing. The same person can be both. We are contradictions. We are flawed.\n\nI\u2019m going to tell you two stories. One full of excuses, the other showing my flaws. Which one is true? They both are. Stop thinking that people are one way or the other. Duality is a lie. And start thinking about people as a pull between two extremes.\n\nThe excuses\u2026.\n\nI have an amazing marriage. My children are grown so I\u2019m an empty nester. My wife is my best friend and I want to be with her for the rest of my life. But, she\u2019s older than me, menopause and medication have lowered her libido. We both work busy stressful jobs, we haven\u2019t shared a bedroom in years (she prefers to set her alarm a few hours before she gets up and snooze it for hours, which kinda seems like torture to me). No kids means household duties are light, we typically take care of our own stuff (we do our own Laundry, etc), a maid service comes in once a month for the heavy cleaning. She is also slightly agoraphobic and usually doesn\u2019t like to go out, canceling most of the things we are planning to do at the last minute. Though I would prefer to go out and do things with her, that usually isn\u2019t an option (though sometimes we do and have a great time).\n\nAfter 20 years of marriage sex is just sex. It\u2019s not special intimacy it was in our 20\u2019s (or at least that we believed it was). We talked about if she minded if I had porn, masturbated, went to strip clubs and tried a prostitute. She was fine with all of it as long as I was safe. Sex is just sex for both of us. I was unhappy without sex, and a sugar relationship makes me a better husband (as crazy as that sounds). I\u2019m more patient, happy and my guilt makes me more attentive and giving.\n\nMy Flaws\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m an asshole and sugaring is the worst thing I do. I am being unfaithful and even though she was fine with prostitution she doesn\u2019t know about the sugaring or the relationship aspect. I should be honest and tell her. I\u2019m risking hurting her, which I tell myself is the last thing I want to do\u2026 but I still sugar\u2026 so is it? I tell myself that telling her would just make her feel like she is failing, but the truth is it\u2019s easier for me. I like having someone to do fun things with, and to have sex with beautiful younger women. That\u2019s the real reason. I\u2019m seeking my own pleasure and risk hurting someone to do it. The very definition of selfish.\n\nIt takes time and money away from us and our savings. Though money isn\u2019t an issue for us, it\u2019s not an insignificant amount.\n\nSo which answer is it?\n\nIt\u2019s both. It\u2019s no libido and I\u2019m an asshole. It\u2019s one gap in a great marriage and selfish desire to fuck a beautiful young woman. It\u2019s what I need, and a horrible betrayal of the person I care about most.\n\nIm not justifying, I\u2019m just sharing my truth with you. I don\u2019t ask you to agree with me, most days I don\u2019t agree with myself. But I hope reading this helped you to understand some of the complexities involved.",

The reason they don't specify it in the abstract is that it is an abstract. If you were genuinely interested in the answer -- I doubt that you are --, you would have looked into the article. \n\nBeing a very kind person, I did it for you: multivariate, P<0.0001, adjusted R^2 =0.536.\n\nFor further questions just read the article or contact the authors (Really, please don't.

            "body": "SB here.  This will be essay and I'm sorry.\n\nI was the HL partner in a dead bedroom for around three years.  From the very start of our relationship I would have to beg for him to sleep with me.  Even though he seemed enthusiastic to date me to begin with, so I was very confused because I didn't have much to offer back then.  I had an apartment and very little income and he was very much more well off than I was.  But at the end of the day...my partner just didn't want to touch me at all.  He didn't want me to give him head, he didn't want to do anal, anything I would offer to try to entice him he would refuse.  He preferred porn or talking to any other woman that wasn't me and masturbation instead.  Ended up getting married 6 months in, having a child, buying a home together and quickly having the typical nuclear family.  I just accepted that I wasn't enough because when I would ask why he never wanted to touch me I got different answers, everything from \"I'm not attracted to you.\"(this was two days after we got married, he had proposed and planned the marriage completely) to \"you get too wet\" or \"not everyone wants to have sex all of the time!\"(he was 23 at the time, masturbating 2-3 times a day and we hadn't slept together but twice a year each year).\n\nSo, I gave up.  Completely.  He would act insane when I attempted to talk about splitting up or divorce.  He didn't want me and only married me because he thought we would \"make a good partnership\" but I wasn't allowed to leave him and find someone who was attracted to me I guess.  So, I thought it was something wrong with my looks, my sexual abilities, even thought maybe I wasn't \"tight enough\" LOL.  This lead to a severe self esteem crash.  The worst depression I'd had since my mother died a few years before and a lot of self hatred.\n\nEventually, I got close to one of my best friends who lived a little ways away from me.  Extremely close.  Turned into a FWB situation.  Long story short, we started sleeping together and I discovered there was nothing wrong with me at all.  Absolutely still \"tight\", there's no such thing as being \"too wet\", have heard I'm pretty and beautiful enough that I might believe it eventually, and I've done a lot of things that have made my FWB or SD say \"WOW, I've never done that/came like that before, that was amazing!\", so now I know that I'm not terribly unskilled. (Not trying to humblebrag, I'm cringing trying to word it properly) \n\nSo, I have spent another two and a half years on a path of sexual discovery and self exploration and appreciation to build myself up after that disastrous marriage.  I know to respect peoples boundaries now though also, that it was probably highly inappropriate for me to beg him constantly to be intimate with me.  Yet, on the other hand if someone doesn't want to have sex with me I also shouldn't be dating them or married to them.  \n\nLessons learned.",

My ex and my ex-bestie broke up soon after our relationship ended because they realised that the only glue that held them together was the excitement of cheating. As soon as they had to deal with the everyday, it was not nearly as fun.\n\nI am not going to defend the SDs here but: if all the effort you are willing to put into a relationship is concentrated in those few hours that you are using to cheat on your wife, it will inherently be more exciting than putting in the hard work, constantly. \n\nOne thins is for sure however, people **will** cheat.

Why is it you\u2019re fine sleeping with a man if you think he\u2019s not able to snap his fingers to solve his dead bedroom? Maybe the SBs in this thread are just gold-diggers who have sacrificed their own conscious for money. \n\n*angry rant over*\n\nNow!\n\nFor my story:\n\nI got married at 19 after dating for two years\n\nHad very little sexual experience for a reference point\n\nAfter a couple years of marriage and no kids my wife explained she\u2019s never been interested in sex and would be happy to never do it or even think about it again\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a history of trauma or abuse, and she simply doesn\u2019t like intimacy\n\nNow having been married for 14 years she has shown zero interest in physical connection even after we\u2019ve tried every type of therapy, talking it out, me doing things from chore-play to guided mediation to learn more about the situation\n\nI am now two days out from asking for a divorce because I am exhausted from hiding my SR trying to cope with feeling beyond devastated that my life partner is totally resigned to leaving me to suffer emotionally, sexually and literally physically because of her disinterested disposition\n\nI feel ENORMOUS guilt, shame and regret for getting into a SR, and it\u2019s haunting how distraught I became after years of unbearable neglect at the hand of someone I adore\n\nIf my wife were beating me with her fists she\u2019d be sent to jail or prison, yet she can deny sex for 14+ years and people tell me to suck it up! I\u2019m not trying to conflate the two things, though emotional abuse is a thing and very damaging",

But we get sick of trying everything, showing up, being romantic, trying to stay fit, trying to make money, providing and trying not to be tempted only to get home all hot and ready only for her to say \"I'm too tired\" or \"I have a headache\"\n\nThe problem is there is NOTHING that will consistently turn on a woman. One day it's muscles, one day it's massages, one day it's a stern tone, the next day its's a sensitive one. \n\nThis is not her fault at all. It's her nature. But it's also not a man's fault for trying or for having his own desires.\n\nWomen constantly ask for grace for things beyond their control but too many don't want to give ANY grace to a man with desires beyond his control (seeing other women).\n\nBoth can be true, but men get blamed no matter what the outcome is.\n\nFor example: no one feels bad for a man whose marriage ended because he was cheating. Plenty of people feel bad for a woman whose marriage ended because she was no longer 'satisfied' (or even if she was cheating).",

Allegedly, after he went through two rounds of inpatient treatment he regained some of his libido but we had been broken up for a while by then. Another died because said partner fell into the already mentioned category of men that grew up watching their mothers cater hand and foot to the entire family and held the same expectation for me while also holding marriage over my head like I had to earn it. He also took too long to finish, like from the jump. It\u2019s apparently always been a struggle for him. But because of that, intimacy became a time consuming task rather than something enjoyable. Truthfully either situation likely could\u2019ve been remedied if either of them had sought therapy. My current SD is in therapy and I have absolutely zero complaints about him, especially in the bedroom.",

I divorced 4 years ago and about two years ago my ex apologized to me.  She was focused on what I didn\u2019t do rather than what I did do\u2026 and after she has had to handle everything on her own (on her days) she has realized how much I did for our family and how little she was actually contributing.  A lot of SAHM\u2019s do a lot but the typical sugar daddy\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t. They have maids, nanny/au pairs, summer camps, night nurses, food services, etc.  It\u2019s not like they are being run ragged from 6am-10pm.  I got the kids up, fed, dressed and to school or camp daily,  she never got up before 9. \n\nHonestly marriage and a happy sex life for 20-30-50 years is hard to accomplish in 2022.   Comparison is the thief of joy and women who spend a lot of time on Social media are comparing themselves to a fake world.  My ex would be depressed because she\u2019s was comparing her pretty awesome life to all of her friends and about 60 celebrities at the same time.   It\u2019s very hard to be happy if that\u2019s the bar you set.   I remember sitting in Santorini in one of those white cave Pool suites.  It\u2019s was amazing.  Laying there together,  no kids,  etc.  She was on her phone ordering six grand worth of clothes.  That was the moment I knew she would never be content and I was leaving her.  \n\nAnd before someone like the OP want to slant this into men being lazy,  not in tune or whatever\u2026 the divorce rates among lesbians is the highest of any group.  100% high than gay men and 50% higher than heterosexual couples.   Men are not the sole problem here.  If we were,  lesbians would have the most rewarding relationships",

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.

The wide range is because it is widely unreported amongst lesbian couples. So you have rates that are equal to or greater than hetero couples and a lower likelihood of reporting.  \n\nHere\u2019s the point I\u2019ve tried to make the whole time that you may be missing, if you if women were sugar and spies and men were the root of all evil, wouldn\u2019t lesbian couples be the happiest on earth?  Wouldn\u2019t they have a really load of horse rate and a really low to vest domestic violence rate.  And because men are terrible, wouldn\u2019t gay couples have twice the issues? \n\nThe stats strongly suggest women over 35 are problematic in relationships.  The average age of marriage for lesbians is 39,  we are not talking about kids. \n\n\n\nhttps://mainweb-v.musc.edu/vawprevention/lesbianrx/factsheet.shtml\n\n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29994648.amp\n\nhttps://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2014/09/domestic-violence-likely-more-frequent-for-same-sex-couples/",

My bedroom is not dead but I will admit it has gone through rough patches in that time.  And it was both of us at fault. Our marriage has been open for about 5 years. \n\nhttps://www.achrnews.com/articles/103961-differences-with-spaghetti-waffle-brains#:~:text=Instead%2C%20it%20proves%20our%20brains,really%20is%20an%20apt%20analogy.\n\nA man forgets about everything else and jumps into the \"sex box\" of his waffle brain. A woman's spaghetti brain is thinking of 20 different things. The thing she forgot to add to the grocery list.  How is she going to get from your youngest child's practice to the older child's game on time tomorrow. Your upcoming business trip. You brought flowers home for her yesterday.  The fact you came home from work and planted yourself in front of the TV while she was trying to finish dinner while simultaneously helping with homework and folding your laundry. When she gets everyone fed and dinner cleaned up,  the kids bathed and to bed she finally crashes and you get upset because she doesn't have any energy left to pay attention to you now that you're wide awake because you napped for a couple hours in your favorite recliner. On her way to bed she has to pick up your dirty clothes from the floor right next to the hamper.  \n\nMy point being most women don't compartmentalize.  Just because you brought flowers home in a romantic gesture all the other stuff matters and gets in the way of her feeling sexy and in the mood. She can't forget about the rest because of one gesture.  Foreplay starts long before the bedroom for women.  \n\nIs sugaring easier?  Absolutely.  Sex is expected.  You likely need to put little effort in and have almost guaranteed success of getting laid. \n\nI'm not trying to fix anyones marriage or saying you should need to make grand gestures for your wife to want to have sex with you or that you haven't tried everything in your power.  I'm trying to make you more aware of the differences in how our brains function so maybe you can understand/empathize  with her more.",

You have to do it when you don\u2019t feel like it and work on it.  You have to accept that sex will sometimes feel like a species of non-sex and be zen about that fact.  If spontaneous is difficult then plan it.  Just keep working actively.\n\nHere\u2019s the saving grace - all you have to do is have sex good enough that you\u2019re more or less happy you did it after the fact the majority of the time.  Thats enough to stabilize the vast mahority of relationships.\n\nIn short, rosy myths that set high expectations about sex are absolutely wrecking us.  If this advice chafes you, thats totally normal and don\u2019t feel bad.  If it seriously upsets you, stop being a fucking baby even if that requires a bunch of psychotherapy.",

It has taken a pretty significant toll on my self esteem over the years.   I understand that your perception is \"wife blaming\" but there's certainly a shared responsibility there.  As many have suggested, over an extended period of time , love deepens and grows in different ways.  The addition of multiple children complicates things as well.  I love my wife to death and would never leave her, but I also am very unfulfilled. I  choose this selfish way to get what I feel like I need and to keep my primary relationship stable.  In the past, my infidelity was with someone who I could have established a more vanilla relationship with and that led to a seriously dangerous situation for me and my emotional state.

Lord, what a lazy misinterpretation of \"dead bedroom\".\n\n>I have observed enough wife blaming here \n\nAnd yet here I am not blaming anyone, my wife or myself. \n\n>(notice how no one mentions their own role, just the wife's \"deficiency\")\n\nSo that's two posts with anecdotes. A fair number of the men responding are rude or entitled. Some make the standard points that *explain the situation* without necessarily blaming anyone.\n\nI can tell you all about how little my wife liked to give oral. I can tell you that she can't have anal for physical reasons. I can tell you all these things, but they don't serve any real purpose. I love my wife. She's awesome. She's my best friend and life partner.\n\n*We also don't have sex*. We're not likely going to find that changing and I've spent the past few years **not being the least bit resentful about it**.\n\nWhy? Because I have sex with other women. Some of them have been so into it it's especially a turn on. All of them have been fun and sexy and it felt good.\n\nThis isn't rocket science.",

            "body": "> Have you truly thought about why your wife no longer wants to have sex with you? If so, why?\n\nLots of anecdotes and uninformed opinions here. As someone who went through this and spent a lot of time going through marriage and individual therapy, reading and researching ... Ultimately, there are problems, misunderstandings, and miscommunications in every relationship, but the biggest problem that leads to a dead bedroom is that more often the woman will feel that \"I am not satisfied with x, so I don't feel like doing y, where y is most often sex.\" Men do that too, but the y part is something much less critical from a primal perspective I.e. cutting the grass. Women don't have a primal urge for grass to be cut. The equivalent for men would be if the Y were: \"I quit my job because I don't feel like working anymore\", which violates a woman's primal need for security.\n\nVery few men let problems in the relationship come down to that, and when it does happen, everyone would tell the man it's unacceptable to quit your job over what you are unhappy about and you need to get your shit together and get a job or the relationship will be over, or she will leave you for someone who can provide financial security.\n\nConversely, when a women doesn't feel like having sex, no one tells the woman it's unacceptable to unilaterally decide not to have sex because of what you are not happy about and that she needs to have sex to have a happy relationship.\n\nThe FACT is, in most dead bedroom relationships, if the woman changed her attitude towards problems and started having sex again, the relationship could be saved.\n\nSource:\nhttps://youtu.be/Ep2MAx95m20\n\nEdit: The downvotes is exactly why dead bedrooms are so common and will continue to be, I hope you never end up with someone who treats you like that, it's awful. Things won't get better until the preposterous audacity of what she says starting at 6:14 sinks in.",

Not only are they cheating but they don\u2019t have the decency to let their wives know because they\u2019re afraid of the outcome of their infidelity.\n\nOP, I think you\u2019re on point with the question and hopefully a few comments here are honest! Men are typically quicker to blame the other side whereas women are quick to blame themselves. Apparently, mismatched libidos is sufficient justification for cheating and mismatched morals justifies hiding infidelity.\n\nI have no doubt that there are plenty of SDs on SA who are great husbands but their wife\u2019s libido has become mismatched for biological reasons. But I do think there\u2019s a significant number of SDs who sugar for the variety/ability to sleep with younger women/feel good about themselves. And for both groups of men, I\u2019ve always wondered how they treat their wives. For many women, sex is tied to an emotional connection. In my last arrangement, I got to a point where I not only didn\u2019t want to have sex with him but didn\u2019t want to kiss him or hold his hand. Had nothing to do with my libido but how he treated me. He\u2019s divorced and of course blamed the divorce on his \u201ccrazy\u201d wife. While I don\u2019t have insight into their marriage, he never blamed himself for anything that led to the demise but consistently spoke about how she never paid for anything during their marriage and he took good care of her. I think many men who consider themselves to be \u201cgood men\u201d don\u2019t know what that actually means. So they don\u2019t self reflect on what role they played and blame the woman. And a chunk never should have gotten married as they\u2019re clearly not the marrying type.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of SDs try to justify that sugaring makes them a better husband and I know that helps them feel better but it\u2019s just not true. A secondary question is why don\u2019t they get divorced? I bet those answers would be quite selfish as well.",

I think op's post is relevent as it does seem a lot of the \"my wife doesn't sleep with me\" is rather nonchalant/nondetailed but it also may at times be that their partner just loses interest over time/is secretly seeing someone else as well or a myriad of different scenarios. Who knows it could be many things. Also sexless marriage is fairly common over time, especially in Japan. It's a complex subject. It's not always someone's \"fault\".",

In the other it was mostly that with a few other things. \n\nAnd all of them were like \"But I'm not asking you to do all of this\" like the result wasn't living in filth - even more unsexy. Or they are like \"OK I'll do it for you\" and then expect me to supervise and \"help\" them do basic tasks like wash a dish or hang laundry up etc which is just as mentally exhasusting. I once came back from a 2 week work trip to find we had a cockroach infestation and 4 bags of rubbish in the kitchen so I just packed the rest of my things and went straight to my friend's house. \n\nThe last one, he agreed to a cleaning rota then hired a cleaner to come and do JUST his parts of the cleaning rota. I was still doing all of my cleaning plus cleaning up after him during the week because he'd let the dishes pile up for his cleaner to do and he was really bad at wiping down the kitchen after he'd used it if it wasn't his turn to do the kitchen. And so on. That was petty af and just killed all desire. \n\nEventually you get tired of working all day and then coming home to a dirty house and having to clean it all up or sit in a dirty house. How can you stay attracted to someone who lives like that? How can ypu be attracted to a man who pretends he's too thick to clean up after himself?\n\n As I got older I decided I would just not move in with anyone who either had a dirty home or objected to a cleaning rota for any reason. Red flags right there!\nIf I have to do all the cleaning to have a basic standard of living then I may as well live on my own and not have to make any other sacrifices to my time! \n\nThe other 2 just...gave up. Like, they got me into the same house and then just stopped bothering to make an effort to go anywhere or do anything. Like...grocery shopping and watching TV or playing games in the same room are not substitutes for dates. It's not nice to feel like you have to work for someone's attention or that you are a piece of furniture, it's such a turn off.",

Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility.

I just think it's weird to have all of these off topic posts lately in what is supposed to be a forum to talk about sugar relationships. Every other post on this forum lately has been weird attacks from shitty, incel or \"hobbyist SDs\" making back-handed comments about SBs or from FDS/escort SBs firing bullshit at the SDs.",

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring.

She shuts down with any kind of anxiety or strong emotion, so none of this can even be brought up. Refuses therapy. I get bombarded by questions about everything when I am home, which just pushes me away since I need to feel welcome and unstressed. Couples therapy (which I initiated and continue to arrange) has done nothing. Before I decided to go the SR route, I was miserable and did not know why. Sexless, and feeling completely trapped. This is more about moving on from an irreparable but necessary marriage.\n\nSo it is essentially me choosing the DB but the alternative seems so sad and depressing.",

I myself have experienced exactly what I am talking about and as you can see other woman agree with me. \n\nExactly what I describe is why I stopped vanilla dating and turned to strictly sugar dating. \n\nI gave and gave and did everything I did to support my ex partner and when ever I needed a little bit of support back I had no help. I was essentially taking care of a whole household on my own. Eventually he lots his job and I was the sole provider financially and responsible for the home with NO help. The man that you think in \u2018insulting\u2019 took my debit card from my purse and would take out cash sneakily. Drink and eat anything I bought for myself and left in the fridge. Go through my phone while I\u2019m sleeping thinking that I\u2019m cheating when I wasn\u2019t. All while he was giving NOTHING and taking EVERYTHING from me. I put locks on everything and was trying to wait until the lease was up in a month and I could resign on my own. The landlord wouldn\u2019t let me take him or of the lease early. He eventually chocked me until I was unconscious because I took his phone as payment for cash he stole from me because I fell sleep with a door unlocked. I had him arrested for the assault and the same day he was released he tried to break into my house. I had to leave my home and city to feel safe again. \n\nI know what I\u2019m talking about, maybe you should too before you call someone a hypocrite because you feel called out. \n\n\nBtw way I didn\u2019t say that men are entitled.. you did. \n\nIn fact I don\u2019t blame men at all. I blame our culture, the culture that effects both genders and is not mutually exclusive to either one. Men may be perpetuating the behaviour that I\u2019m describing but I also call out their mothers that helped in-still this behaviour in childhood. Both genders play a role and it\u2019s unproductive to blame either one. \n\nWhy don\u2019t YOU take your shit else were. \n\nLooks like I hit a nerve.. I hope you can do some self reflection on why.",

The reason they don't specify it in the abstract is that it is an abstract. If you were genuinely interested in the answer -- I doubt that you are --, you would have looked into the article. \n\nBeing a very kind person, I did it for you: multivariate, P<0.0001, adjusted R^2 =0.536.\n\nFor further questions just read the article or contact the authors (Really, please don't.

Until I found a guy (or more) who were up for it and my needs were also satisfied. My ex and my ex-bestie broke up soon after our relationship ended because they realised that the only glue that held them together was the excitement of cheating. As soon as they had to deal with the everyday, it was not nearly as fun.\n\nI am not going to defend the SDs here but: if all the effort you are willing to put into a relationship is concentrated in those few hours that you are using to cheat on your wife, it will inherently be more exciting than putting in the hard work, constantly. \n\nOne thins is for sure however, people **will** cheat.

If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.

Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

I went from begging to rejecting her and filing for divorce. I went from kissing her butt all the time to not giving an inch on anything.  She went from thinking she was the best I could do to seeing what I have dated after we separated aNd she still tries to compete.  Part of it is her wanting her old life back but the other part is that I went from being very agreeable to saying no to everything.  She has BPD so her brain shifted back to the idealizing phase from 10 years of devaluation.",

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

So you have rates that are equal to or greater than hetero couples and a lower likelihood of reporting.  \n\nHere\u2019s the point I\u2019ve tried to make the whole time that you may be missing, if you if women were sugar and spies and men were the root of all evil, wouldn\u2019t lesbian couples be the happiest on earth?  Wouldn\u2019t they have a really load of horse rate and a really low to vest domestic violence rate.  And because men are terrible, wouldn\u2019t gay couples have twice the issues? \n\nThe stats strongly suggest women over 35 are problematic in relationships.

Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility.

I just think it's weird to have all of these off topic posts lately in what is supposed to be a forum to talk about sugar relationships. Every other post on this forum lately has been weird attacks from shitty, incel or \"hobbyist SDs\" making back-handed comments about SBs or from FDS/escort SBs firing bullshit at the SDs.",

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring. If you do, more power to you but I simply replied to another commenters question as to why this wasn't the forum for the OP's question.",

I myself have experienced exactly what I am talking about and as you can see other woman agree with me. \n\nExactly what I describe is why I stopped vanilla dating and turned to strictly sugar dating. \n\nI gave and gave and did everything I did to support my ex partner and when ever I needed a little bit of support back I had no help. I was essentially taking care of a whole household on my own. Eventually he lots his job and I was the sole provider financially and responsible for the home with NO help. The man that you think in \u2018insulting\u2019 took my debit card from my purse and would take out cash sneakily. Drink and eat anything I bought for myself and left in the fridge. Go through my phone while I\u2019m sleeping thinking that I\u2019m cheating when I wasn\u2019t. All while he was giving NOTHING and taking EVERYTHING from me. I put locks on everything and was trying to wait until the lease was up in a month and I could resign on my own. The landlord wouldn\u2019t let me take him or of the lease early. He eventually chocked me until I was unconscious because I took his phone as payment for cash he stole from me because I fell sleep with a door unlocked. I had him arrested for the assault and the same day he was released he tried to break into my house. I had to leave my home and city to feel safe again. \n\nI know what I\u2019m talking about, maybe you should too before you call someone a hypocrite because you feel called out. \n\n\nBtw way I didn\u2019t say that men are entitled.. you did. \n\nIn fact I don\u2019t blame men at all. I blame our culture, the culture that effects both genders and is not mutually exclusive to either one. Men may be perpetuating the behaviour that I\u2019m describing but I also call out their mothers that helped in-still this behaviour in childhood. Both genders play a role and it\u2019s unproductive to blame either one. \n\nWhy don\u2019t YOU take your shit else were. \n\nLooks like I hit a nerve..

The reason they don't specify it in the abstract is that it is an abstract. If you were genuinely interested in the answer -- I doubt that you are --, you would have looked into the article. \n\nBeing a very kind person, I did it for you: multivariate, P<0.0001, adjusted R^2 =0.536.\n\nFor further questions just read the article or contact the authors (Really, please don't.

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility.

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring. If you do, more power to you but I simply replied to another commenters question as to why this wasn't the forum for the OP's question.",

Then I called to apologize bc I didn't want it to be in the back of his mind since I knew he was panicky and hadn't wanted to get off the phone but I didn't want his date waiting on him. I apologized and he apologized for contributing to how I felt and said we would work out a plan and make sure that didn't happen. Chances are we will use slack and/or Google calendar.

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

I went from begging to rejecting her and filing for divorce. I went from kissing her butt all the time to not giving an inch on anything.  She went from thinking she was the best I could do to seeing what I have dated after we separated aNd she still tries to compete.  Part of it is her wanting her old life back but the other part is that I went from being very agreeable to saying no to everything.  She has BPD so her brain shifted back to the idealizing phase from 10 years of devaluation.",

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

So you have rates that are equal to or greater than hetero couples and a lower likelihood of reporting.  \n\nHere\u2019s the point I\u2019ve tried to make the whole time that you may be missing, if you if women were sugar and spies and men were the root of all evil, wouldn\u2019t lesbian couples be the happiest on earth?  Wouldn\u2019t they have a really load of horse rate and a really low to vest domestic violence rate.  And because men are terrible, wouldn\u2019t gay couples have twice the issues? \n\nThe stats strongly suggest women over 35 are problematic in relationships.  The average age of marriage for lesbians is 39,  we are not talking about kids. \n\n\n\nhttps://mainweb-v.musc.edu/vawprevention/lesbianrx/factsheet.shtml\n\n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29994648.amp\n\nhttps://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2014/09/domestic-violence-likely-more-frequent-for-same-sex-couples/",

Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility.

He did tell me they were prob getting together this weekend and I forgot about it). Then I called to apologize bc I didn't want it to be in the back of his mind since I knew he was panicky and hadn't wanted to get off the phone but I didn't want his date waiting on him. I apologized and he apologized for contributing to how I felt and said we would work out a plan and make sure that didn't happen. Chances are we will use slack and/or Google calendar. Thanks, I really just needed to get that off my chest. \n\nI'm still gonna coyly suggest he send me a present to help me feel better. Hmmm...what to ask for...",

The reason they don't specify it in the abstract is that it is an abstract. If you were genuinely interested in the answer -- I doubt that you are --, you would have looked into the article. \n\nBeing a very kind person, I did it for you: multivariate, P<0.0001, adjusted R^2 =0.536.\n\nFor further questions just read the article or contact the authors (Really, please don't.

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

So you have rates that are equal to or greater than hetero couples and a lower likelihood of reporting.  \n\nHere\u2019s the point I\u2019ve tried to make the whole time that you may be missing, if you if women were sugar and spies and men were the root of all evil, wouldn\u2019t lesbian couples be the happiest on earth?  Wouldn\u2019t they have a really load of horse rate and a really low to vest domestic violence rate.  And because men are terrible, wouldn\u2019t gay couples have twice the issues? \n\nThe stats strongly suggest women over 35 are problematic in relationships.

Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility.

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring.

Then I called to apologize bc I didn't want it to be in the back of his mind since I knew he was panicky and hadn't wanted to get off the phone but I didn't want his date waiting on him. I apologized and he apologized for contributing to how I felt and said we would work out a plan and make sure that didn't happen. Chances are we will use slack and/or Google calendar.

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

I went from begging to rejecting her and filing for divorce. I went from kissing her butt all the time to not giving an inch on anything.  She went from thinking she was the best I could do to seeing what I have dated after we separated aNd she still tries to compete.  Part of it is her wanting her old life back but the other part is that I went from being very agreeable to saying no to everything.  She has BPD so her brain shifted back to the idealizing phase from 10 years of devaluation.",

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

Nuclear family units are 'stable' (not sure if true, 50% divorce rate + rate of unhappy marriages + one partner dying before divorce = many unhappy, unstable marriages)\n2. Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility. Regardless of how educated and liberal I was, the conditioning I had since a baby was quite difficult to ignore.",

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring. If you do, more power to you but I simply replied to another commenters question as to why this wasn't the forum for the OP's question.",

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

She went from thinking she was the best I could do to seeing what I have dated after we separated aNd she still tries to compete.

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

Nuclear family units are 'stable' (not sure if true, 50% divorce rate + rate of unhappy marriages + one partner dying before divorce = many unhappy, unstable marriages)\n2. Uh... why am I trying to justify? Oh. Right. Married men are really fucking productive, according to some reports they work the longest hours etc etc\n3. Restricted sexual access to your partner is important to a lot of people, saves you time and emotional energy you'd otherwise spend being jealous, mate-guarding, whatever it is\n\nI'm with you, I honestly don't know why we do the things the way we do them. I got married when I was much younger, and less knowledgeable about the world. I got married because we got pregnant and how I was raised, that meant we *had* to get married regardless of compatibility. Regardless of how educated and liberal I was, the conditioning I had since a baby was quite difficult to ignore.",

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring.

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

Most very long term relationships are overwhelmingly to provide a basis for life outside of romance.  So you have the sex to keep the relationship stable, and have relationship to keep your life stable.\n\nDoesnt work every time but a ton of people who just force the sex successfully prevent  the relationship from slipping.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s actually paradoxically more stabilizing for two partners to both have low drive.  Then when they have effortful sex that takes work it\u2019s a project they work on together rather than fulfilling a demand.  It\u2019s bonding in that way.  Kinda fucked when the need of one partner is imposed on one who doesnt want to do it - then there is someone to resent.",

Relationships have seasons and phases and and if someone hasn\u2019t been through that phase and passed the level then they don\u2019t really know what they are doing.  If you have not been through the stress of the first 6 months of having a baby then your advice on that isn\u2019t sound.  If you\u2019ve never had your spouse fired from a job, you don\u2019t know how to deal with that.  If you\u2019ve never lost a parent or had to have a disabled parent move in with you\u2026 you don\u2019t know how to handle that. God forbid the death of a child at any age.  God forbid disease or disability to a partner.  A 20-30-50 year marriage is going to have challenges that are in no way prepared for.  And while a younger person with a 2 year relationship under their belt can have opinions,  if they have not crossed those bridges it is uneducated advice",

Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

The other 4 are from a year or more older and even those aren't the same type of post as here. \n\nMy original point still stands. I personally don't think this is not the forum to discuss why someone doesn't fix their own dead bedroom issue or the forum for why someone else doesn't fix their daddy issues instead of sugaring.

Not saying any of this to validate my own self, just reminding you that folks can go through a fuck ton together in shorter spans of time and their experiences shouldn\u2019t be invalid based off of length. \n\nHell, I know lots of boomers who have been married for decades that I would NEVER EVER take relationship advice from because their shit is toxic as hell lol soooo",

The biggest number he gave for someone whose advice he didn't need was 6 years. 6 years is a far cry from 15, ffs. And why not? There is far more change in the average 20 years than the average 6. Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",

I went from kissing her butt all the time to not giving an inch on anything.  She went from thinking she was the best I could do to seeing what I have dated after we separated aNd she still tries to compete.  Part of it is her wanting her old life back but the other part is that I went from being very agreeable to saying no to everything.  She has BPD so her brain shifted back to the idealizing phase from 10 years of devaluation.",

The biggest number he gave for someone whose advice he didn't need was 6 years. 6 years is a far cry from 15, ffs. And why not? There is far more change in the average 20 years than the average 6. Someone who can climb the ladder for 6 years might not be able to handle 20, and if you want to hold on for the full 20, anything the 6 years have to say is hard to judge for it's quality, as they haven't proved themselves capable of what you're trying to do, they haven't had to live it, so they don't even know if their advice is good for the desired outcome.\n\nCould someone with a six year relationship give good advice for a 20 year relationship? Yeah, but they could also give bad advice and they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, because they have no experience of the specific context they're giving advice for.",
