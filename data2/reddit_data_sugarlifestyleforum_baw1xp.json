    "body": "Date was going great, somehow we get onto the topic of music. I start listing my favourite artists and genres, and this leads to me remarking that said artist is playing in my city currently. I was talking about how much I would have loved to see him and how amazing I imagine he is live (completely OBLIVIOUS to the fact that at the very same time POT is purchasing tickets for me and a friend). \n\nHe let me know later by emailing me the e tickets. \nHe did this all without any expectation, just pure altruism.\n\nJust wanted to put it here as I was so taken back and grateful that there are people as selfless and generous as this.",
