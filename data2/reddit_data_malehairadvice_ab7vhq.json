It's where you take your damp hair and press it towards your scalp while it's drying, this'll help it go into sections like in the photo, as well as bring out any subtle curl you might have. If you dont have curl, then get some hair wax, work it into your hair well, and then plop it. You can look up videos on how to plop on YouTube, it's a hair technique for those peeps with curly hair. :) hope this helped!",
