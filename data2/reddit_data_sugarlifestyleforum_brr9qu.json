            "body": "I am a professional cuddler with this site you speak of. It is legit and it fills needs for people who are looking for non-sexual touch. \n\nI feel pretty strongly about this and love to sing the praises of the platonic cuddle session to any who will listen.\n\nI draw pretty clear boundaries between my work as a cuddler and my relationships as a SB. Each role is very distinct in my mind. \n\nSBs looking for a platonic SD are not likely to find such on CC. In my experience, dudes coming to me for cuddling services fall into a few basic categories.\n\n* Genuine need for platonic touch because of damaged relationships, recently widowed, dead bedroom and no desire to cheat, anxiety, depression, etc. My role in this is to nurture and chat and be present for them.\n\n* Married dead bedroom and seeing if they can get away with cheating. Caveat here is that they are respectful and don't try anything. If they get caught they know they can play innocentish. They won't be in as much trouble as if they got caught f*cking someone.\n\n* Looking for a hookup or hoping for an upsell. These dudes are trash. And I  or any other legit cuddler are in far more potential danger meeting up with them than I have ever been with any SD ever.\n\nThe site has pretty strict rules about pro cuddlers not participating in other sites (escorts specifically). I have a feeling that if they matched my profile on SA or SB to my profile on CC, I would be banned from CC. I hope it never happens but I would totally understand if it did. \n\nI have had some interesting experiences as a cuddler. I have been so turned on during a session that I've refused to see the client a 2nd time (I explain why). I have some great regular clients with whom I've developed fantastic friendships. I have been nearly raped. Just like with SA, I think the new laws around trafficking have driven the scum and scammers in droves to CC.\n\nAs a true believer in cuddle therapy and a pro provider going on 3 years, I am willing and happy to answer any questions you might have about it. Please feel free to PM me.",

My spidey-senses are so much better now and my backbone is so much stronger. \n\nMistake 1: not trusting my gut when his initial messages sent up some yellow flags.\n\nMistake 2: I was financially desperate and didn't walk as soon as I saw the problems because I was afraid of losing the income\n\nMistake 3: I went with him in his car from a public space to his home in a gated community. Super dumb.\n\nMistake 4: Not insisting on a separate meet and greet (which I now require for all locals. It helps weed out the group 3s from my original post. I still work with travelers so the separate meet and greet is not always practical but I engage in a lot of discussion before letting them schedule and the group 3s will typically get bored and move on).\n\nMistake 5: crappy phone that bombed on GPS so I couldn't provide my location to my safety buddy.\n\n\nWhat I did right:\n1. Kept him calm, had to play along a little because it was the smart thing to do. Sometimes you just have to. He had all the advantage that day.\n\n2. Had a check in buddy and was very vocal about needing to do my check ins.\n\n3. Blocked and reported him as soon as I got home.\n\nEdit for formatting.",

Super dumb.\n\nMistake 4: Not insisting on a separate meet and greet (which I now require for all locals. It helps weed out the group 3s from my original post. I still work with travelers so the separate meet and greet is not always practical but I engage in a lot of discussion before letting them schedule and the group 3s will typically get bored and move on).\n\nMistake 5: crappy phone that bombed on GPS so I couldn't provide my location to my safety buddy.\n\n\nWhat I did right:\n1. Kept him calm, had to play along a little because it was the smart thing to do. Sometimes you just have to. He had all the advantage that day.\n\n2. Had a check in buddy and was very vocal about needing to do my check ins.\n\n3. Blocked and reported him as soon as I got home.\n\nEdit for formatting.",

Super dumb.\n\nMistake 4: Not insisting on a separate meet and greet (which I now require for all locals. It helps weed out the group 3s from my original post. I still work with travelers so the separate meet and greet is not always practical but I engage in a lot of discussion before letting them schedule and the group 3s will typically get bored and move on).\n\nMistake 5: crappy phone that bombed on GPS so I couldn't provide my location to my safety buddy.\n\n\nWhat I did right:\n1. Kept him calm, had to play along a little because it was the smart thing to do. Sometimes you just have to. He had all the advantage that day.\n\n2. Had a check in buddy and was very vocal about needing to do my check ins.\n\n3. Blocked and reported him as soon as I got home.\n\nEdit for formatting.",
