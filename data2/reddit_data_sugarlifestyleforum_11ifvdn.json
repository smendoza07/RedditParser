The context is SD's want something sexual and SB's want financial benefit right? That's the foundation of seeking so why would you wish those people would stay off of the site?  That's the basis of the whole thing.\n\nTo clarify for bthdk85 though a SB who doesn't hold up her end of the arrangement is called a fraud and likely is trying to make a living off of extorting men.  A gold digger is a woman who doesn't have an arrangement or some agreed upon financially beneficial situation who  pursues / dates / hooks up with men with a plan to use him for his money only.  SB's are very closely related but it's not the same.  I've come across SB's that made fraud / extortion their full time jobs which was a mistake because they went to jail.  No joke \n\nIt's so simple to the point that if you don't understand the following then your motives & intelligence are very questionable.......... if you're not wanting anything physical as a SB, or not willing to contribute financially as a SD don't get on that site.  It's that basic",

Even the SDs/Ms I've had sexual relationships with I actually liked and respected as people, not cash cows. \n\nI get that for a lot of people sugaring has turned into more straightforward give money, get sex but all the relationships I was in, sexual or non, did not have that kind of overt transactional feeling.

I was definitely sexually attracted to them, and we generally shared the same sex drive, but every now and then, I\u2019d just prefer quality time minus sex because I actually liked them. The issue was the expectation of sex every time we met because of me receiving gifts and money. Like, we can\u2019t just watch a couple of movies or cook dinner together.\n\nIf this expectation had been explained to me when discussing the arrangement, I could\u2019ve realized we aren\u2019t compatible and suggested that we not waste each other\u2019s time.\n\nI was young and new and without much guidance, so I wasn\u2019t aware of how things can be (I hadn\u2019t done much vanilla dating back then, either lol), and honestly, I wasn\u2019t good at standing up for myself. Error on my part.\n\nAll in all, I had my lessons learned, and I\u2019m a better and more knowledgeable person for it.\n\nAgain, I deeply appreciate your sentiment!",

But digging deeper, the intent is usually different. I've had conversations with so-called platonic SB, some of them so naively believe that all real SR are platonic and that any guy that wants sex and is offering an allowance is looking for a prostitute. Unless thats some type of negging manipulation used by some, it seems to be universally believed by many women that sugar is some type of charity / sponsorship / mentor BS.",

The context is SD's want something sexual and SB's want financial benefit right? That's the foundation of seeking so why would you wish those people would stay off of the site?  That's the basis of the whole thing.\n\nTo clarify for bthdk85 though a SB who doesn't hold up her end of the arrangement is called a fraud and likely is trying to make a living off of extorting men.  A gold digger is a woman who doesn't have an arrangement or some agreed upon financially beneficial situation who  pursues / dates / hooks up with men with a plan to use him for his money only.  SB's are very closely related but it's not the same.  I've come across SB's that made fraud / extortion their full time jobs which was a mistake because they went to jail.  No joke \n\nIt's so simple to the point that if you don't understand the following then your motives & intelligence are very questionable.......... if you're not wanting anything physical as a SB, or not willing to contribute financially as a SD don't get on that site.  It's that basic",

There's also girls on the other side of this who promise intimacy and don't hold up their end of the deal when they get their allowance. \ud83d\ude15\n\nTWSD",

But digging deeper, the intent is usually different. I've had conversations with so-called platonic SB, some of them so naively believe that all real SR are platonic and that any guy that wants sex and is offering an allowance is looking for a prostitute. Unless thats some type of negging manipulation used by some, it seems to be universally believed by many women that sugar is some type of charity / sponsorship / mentor BS.",

The context is SD's want something sexual and SB's want financial benefit right? That's the foundation of seeking so why would you wish those people would stay off of the site?  That's the basis of the whole thing.\n\nTo clarify for bthdk85 though a SB who doesn't hold up her end of the arrangement is called a fraud and likely is trying to make a living off of extorting men.  A gold digger is a woman who doesn't have an arrangement or some agreed upon financially beneficial situation who  pursues / dates / hooks up with men with a plan to use him for his money only.  SB's are very closely related but it's not the same.  I've come across SB's that made fraud / extortion their full time jobs which was a mistake because they went to jail.  No joke \n\nIt's so simple to the point that if you don't understand the following then your motives & intelligence are very questionable.......... if you're not wanting anything physical as a SB, or not willing to contribute financially as a SD don't get on that site.  It's that basic",

But digging deeper, the intent is usually different. I've had conversations with so-called platonic SB, some of them so naively believe that all real SR are platonic and that any guy that wants sex and is offering an allowance is looking for a prostitute.

That's the basis of the whole thing.\n\nTo clarify for bthdk85 though a SB who doesn't hold up her end of the arrangement is called a fraud and likely is trying to make a living off of extorting men.  A gold digger is a woman who doesn't have an arrangement or some agreed upon financially beneficial situation who  pursues / dates / hooks up with men with a plan to use him for his money only.  SB's are very closely related but it's not the same.  I've come across SB's that made fraud / extortion their full time jobs which was a mistake because they went to jail.  No joke \n\nIt's so simple to the point that if you don't understand the following then your motives & intelligence are very questionable.......... if you're not wanting anything physical as a SB, or not willing to contribute financially as a SD don't get on that site.  It's that basic",

The context is SD's want something sexual and SB's want financial benefit right? That's the foundation of seeking so why would you wish those people would stay off of the site?  That's the basis of the whole thing.\n\nTo clarify for bthdk85 though a SB who doesn't hold up her end of the arrangement is called a fraud and likely is trying to make a living off of extorting men.  A gold digger is a woman who doesn't have an arrangement or some agreed upon financially beneficial situation who  pursues / dates / hooks up with men with a plan to use him for his money only.  SB's are very closely related but it's not the same.  I've come across SB's that made fraud / extortion their full time jobs which was a mistake because they went to jail.  No joke \n\nIt's so simple to the point that if you don't understand the following then your motives & intelligence are very questionable.......... if you're not wanting anything physical as a SB, or not willing to contribute financially as a SD don't get on that site.  It's that basic",
