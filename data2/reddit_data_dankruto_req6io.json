The guy was too dangerous to let live and he would try to make sure Naruto would not become Hokage since he rejects the other Hokage except maybe Tobirama. He said Tsunade, Kakashi, Jiraiya, and Hiruzen's worldview was wrong and Naruto learned from them.\n\nDanzo may fuck up the other nations first too and the alliance breaks down seeing as he used Komoamatsukami on Mifune and tried to have the Byakugan taken back from Ao.",
