    "body": "I posted about a month ago that my home buying preapproval letter was in my hand and my home ownership search was underway. UPDATE...My loan just went to the closing department, anticipating closing 12/2...next week! I take possession of my own place, start paying myself the rent, no longer to a corporation! What a journey this turned into, 3 years ahead of my own timeline. Plan to continue with my SR, need to rebuild my savings for my next goal. My future is looking brighter and brighter. \ud83d\udc97",

The owner had to move unexpectedly after a recent remodel, she over priced when she listed so no interest and I showed up with a reasonable bid for where the market is. I'm a very lucky lady, she accepted. I feel like I got a steal! With the way rents rise, I'll pay less long term monthly. If I rented a place with all the extras she added, my mortgage will be 6 crisp bills under that rental cost. Next year my current rent increase will put me over what my mortgage payment is. It's a solid move for short term and long term. Build up some more savings, investing along the way, see what happens in 2021!",

The owner had to move unexpectedly after a recent remodel, she over priced when she listed so no interest and I showed up with a reasonable bid for where the market is. I'm a very lucky lady, she accepted. I feel like I got a steal! With the way rents rise, I'll pay less long term monthly. If I rented a place with all the extras she added, my mortgage will be 6 crisp bills under that rental cost. Next year my current rent increase will put me over what my mortgage payment is. It's a solid move for short term and long term. Build up some more savings, investing along the way, see what happens in 2021!",
