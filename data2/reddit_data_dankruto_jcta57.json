Like I said, the mere power clash of Hashi and Tobi even had Orochimaru worried. And Hashirama dealt with Madara before. Plus it\u2019s not like Sasuke himself had a way to deal with the Edo Tensei. Orochimaru would have to release it but the 4 Kage undoubtedly have plenty of ways to deal with him. Suigetsu and Jugo aren\u2019t really a factor either. With Hashirama using Wood, Tobi and Minato using Flying Rajin, Hashi and Minato using Sage, Minato using Kyuubi, and Hiruzen having all five basic releases, the first 4 Kage pretty much have all their bases covered except for ocular power. Plus Minato has a slew of Sealing Jutsu at his disposal.",

Nothing really one shots that woman. \n\nHe either catches her off guard with the Totsuka blade to seal her or is able to put her out with Tsukuyomi. He could also potentially burn her with Amaterasu, but I'd bet she can outheal its damage until she runs out of chakra doing so.\n\nLet us remember that she is practically unkillable through any normal means, and that Itachi's Susanoo is a far cry from being able to guard himself from Tsunade. If she was able to punch her way through *Madara's* Susanoo, Itachi might as well not use his Susanoo for its defence.\n\nI still think Itachi wins this fight probably 8 times out of 10, but it is never going to be easy. It's hard fought each and every time.",

Amaterasu could work since it burns for a whole week. She\u2019d have to cut off the affected area and heal.\n\nI don't know anything about the Kashin Koji thing. Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

I also think 100 Healings is pretty cool. But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other.

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

However, Obito doesn\u2019t have his other Sharingan, so he won\u2019t be able to spam Kamui like Kakashi does. And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Basically canceling him out.\n\n And all kakashi would need to do for the first one is just send a clone that has enough chakra for a lightning blade which at worst is 1/4th of his chakra meaning he retains 75%, (it would be higher considering how much he was able to spam that shit in the war).",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

When Kakashi temporarily inherited Obito's Sharingan, he blitzes Kaguya and slashes her in half. In both power and speed, Kaguya scales above Rinne-Sharingan Madara who scales above Juubito by a considerable amount. \n\n>Shisui have a pair of Koto, he can genjutsu GG two of them, commands Hiruzen to commit sepuku \n\nThere is no way Shisui is going to defeat Hiruzen--the second person to be dubbed \"God of Shinobi\" and a man who knows all the Jutsu in the Konoha archives. Even when he was an old man and way out of his prime, he was regarded as the strongest Kage among the other living Kages which includes Onoki and Unruly A. As for Tsunade, perhaps, but Shisui got his eye taken by Danzo who is only stronger than Tsunade if he uses Izanagi. \n\n>Itachi have Tsukuyomi and only one Koto, he can genjutsu GG one of them with Koto, makes that Minato, then he can torture Tobirama with Tsukuyomi by making him live in a dream where he is the Uchihas' slave \n\nNo, just no... It is not possible for alive/sick Itachi to counter the Flying Raijin which is used by both Minato and Tobirama and he doesn't have enough stamina to keep up Susanoo before he gets finished by a Rasengan. The only plausible state Itachi could win would be Edo Tensei Itachi with unlimited chakra, but then Minato would get KCM so I doubt he could win this scenario either.",

The only characters that were stronger in their Edo Tensei state was Itachi because he was mortally ill and Minato because he sealed half of Kurama's chakra inside him when he died. For the record, we know enough about Tobirama that he's no pushover. He killed Izuna who was regarded as an equal to Madara at the time of his death. I think this statement is a little hyperbolic, but he should at least be relative to MS Madara. \n\n>even weak ass skeleton-only Susanoo can tank a thousand rasengan, but Minato have zero counter to Kotoamatsukami\n\nWhat I meant was that Itachi would not be able to sustain his Susanoo for very long with his stamina. It's highly unlikely Itachi could hit Minato with Totsuka Blade before he was wore out.\n\n>Tobirama no zero counter to Tsukuyomi = fact \n\nTobirama fought and killed various Uchiha prior to the peace agreement. I would find it hard to believe he wouldn't have a counter to Tsukuyomi.",

You'll have to restructure your sentence.\n\n>Because data book is retarded too, isn't Hiraishin a non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from Konoha?? What about Edo Tensei? Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

When Kakashi fell out of his Susanoo, Kaguya noticed he had not been hit before he slashed her shoulder open right at the 5:58 time stamp.\n\n>Nope, the moment that statement gets contradicted it is irrelevant. Databook = useless.\n\nEnlighten me then. How is it contradicted? I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o. So what we see of Kakshi using DMS is essentially just Obito using it in Kakashis subconscious.",

Edo Minato (war arc) also showed more Hiraishin (the super long name jutsus) and Senjutsu feats than when he is alive, even if I am ignoring the Kyuubi\n\nso I am not going to let you make such a bias argument that Hanzo not living up to hype determines that alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tobirama, when Edo Hashirama and Edo Minato show more feats than their alive forms \n\nItachi kept up with KCM1 Naruto and fought alongside EMS Sasuke just fine, don't care if you think Naruto \"was just talking\", he saved Naruto's and Bee's asses from Nagato so clearly he can fight at that playing field \n\n>I'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan\n\nThank you. \n\nThat's a Might Guy's feat against a non-bloodlusted Itachi, a normal eyes field of vision is 120 degrees, that means Minato will have to look the other 240 degrees away when fighting Itachi and Kotoamatsukami was never even shown to require eyes contact as Danzo casted it on Mifune while wearing his bandages, but this will get nowhere, if you still think Minato will blitz Itachi before he can cast the genjutsu, then lets just agree to disagree",

Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at. And hashirama and tobirama know how to fight in it. Honestly you overestimate the uchiha and underestimated the hokage. They aren\u2019t the hokage because their pushovers",

Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye.

To imply that Koto and Tsukuyomi are inherently a one shot genjutsu is disingenuous at best. Sasuke broke out of tsukoyomi with no MS. Also just a heads up Infinite Tsukoyomi and Itachi's Tsukoyomi are distinctly different. If youre  under the mindset that Itachi Uchiha is planetary in terms of scaling you cant be reasoned with.  For instance Killer Bee fought against a reanimated Itachi with \"Infinite chakra\" and all he had to do was avoid looking into itachi's eyes. Naruto even stated that if he got caught by Tsukuyomi he'd be done for. This is the same Bee that got 2v1'd by Minato (the man you claim Itachi could one shot) Even with the help of Unruly A. You really think that just because a character has an ability that is capable of one shotting people they just win instantly? If that were the case Damn near every war arch character is top tier in the verse. Shit, Darui with sage tools one shots the 10 tails by that logic.",

Because Naruto recieved the soul baptism whatever of his demigod reincarnation though, he became a true So6p, gaining far mkre power than Madara or Obito.\n\n>Madara will still beat him with Mugen Tsukuyomi\n\nThe thing that most people are confused about us that the Tsukyomi is not a guaranteed hit or end all be all move. While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

I mean if we give madara rinnegan we should also give hashirama it. \n\nI tend to believe its more a restriction on the user for koto. What i mean is using it once means you have to wait to use it again even with both eyes and him being the true user. For shisui i could see it being a few days or hours restriction, itachi said it would be a decade before the crows eye could do it again, and danzo could at most only do it once a day with the assistance of hashi cells. We don\u2019t know the cooldown ramifications of shisui since its his eyes (like madara said the true power of the eyes is unlocked with the original owner).\n\nMinato might not have been a perfect sage which i think is debatable. He was able to instantly go into the mode in the middle of a battlefeild and possesed only the sage eye rings and no other features like perfect sage naruto. I think minato was being modest but regardless he can do sage mode, sm odamda rasengans are said to be able to carve away mountains in the data books and damaged Kurama, which is definitely comparable in durability to itachis susano\u2019o. Really susano\u2019os are incredibly good defence but unless u got perfect susanoo they aren\u2019t unbeatble. 5 kage sasukes susanoo was damaged ect multiple times. So was madaras by the raikage. I definitely think a sage mode amped odama rasengan can damage a non perfect susano when raikage damaged it twice and naruto damaged kurama with it in his fight.\n\nHis shield would deflect it but the rest of his susanoo can be damaged and its more of a stamina check than anything. Can minato damage susano\u2019o enough to win? I don\u2019t see itachi hitting him so its a battle of endurance.",

The exceptions aside, the only uchiha who supported the villiage didn't stand up for the villiage against their own clan. \n\nHis big mistake was not trusting Madara. Sometimes Lal it takes it a little love. Hashi showed it to Madara. If not for that eavesdropping and if he had continued to eavesdrop instead of stoping midway, he'd know that Hashi loved Him. Madara would become second Hokage and the cycle of hate would've ended. \n\nI personally believe he'd be proud of Sarada as well.",

Minato and Tobirama can literally teleport anyone to them to heal. The only weak link is literally Hiruzen. And Hiruzen and Minato can literally Reaper Death Seal Itachi and Obito. Also Naruto can Kyubi cloak everyone giving more Chakra. FTG spamming anyone \n\nNOTE:  And I know they will hate this but the Hokages will outsmart the Uchiha.

Stop it. Because that's literally like me saying can't Minato and Tobirama speed blitz the entire Uchiha team before they even know what's going on. And again Sasuke will be too preoccupied with Naruto. Naruto had a weakened Kakashi and Sakura for Christ sakes when he fought Sasuke. He now has all the Hokages including his dad who caught 8 Gates Guy before Juubi Madara could in his base form. They are not the same speed as Minato that is false. Obito never kept up with Minato that is false. And you're making an assumption that FTG does not work against Chibaku Tensei. FTG worked against Kamui.\n\nEdit: As well you are downplaying Hashi and the others. Madara in base form beat the Tailed Beast. So using Sasuke Chibaku tensei feat is really not a big deal.

The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

And Madara is legit her second fav uchiha after Shisui. She has every novel even the japanese ones. Reads the manga left to right. And she still does not see any way Naruto would lose to Madara.

So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra. And it's shown in the manga Sasuke even feels pain from loosing it. So it's a huge distraction. \n\nSasuke didn't prove he was much better a fighter.

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments.

She's very good at vs. you saying what you said shows no credibility. \n\nOn the other hand if could show some feats, like I can that'd be cool and I'd be willing to debate it. \n\nNaruto was faster than Madara and his clones kept up with the limbo clones, which shows speed, sometimes even out speeding Madara. Again like I said, this was before he unlocked boil release, which he used to speed up even further. Madara was tired at that point. Naruto wasn't. Madara DID hit Naruto and Naruto got back up and kept going. Naruto hit Madara and the dude had to pause for a sec and then knew to dodge the next hits. \nMadara sent an attack Naruto's way and it was blocked.

You are right...Madara wins IF he gets a jutsu he had to work an entire lifetime to get. To me that's not an impressive feat. But if he gets it off Naruto is trapped. However Naruto is faster than before...by a lot. And stronger by A LOT seeing as he took a hit that destroyed the moon. Madara is not planetary level except in genjutsu. \n\nSo who ever hits first wins because I had to rewatch that scene and read it. And it does take a while to set it off. Naruto would crash through now. \nNow if we are talking about feats that impress me. Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended based on his OWN will to live... That's impressive.\n\nAdd on: let's not even go into the fact to go against Naruto he'd need another God tree fruit which is possible but that's a whole different level of wtf. Not only that but we don't know if the full ninetails can block it. It was suggested in the hiden but they can't confirm it.",

Ok. \n\nWhere is it stated that Naruto is faster **by a lot** than in chapter 676? \n\nMadara 1-2 panels to fly to the sky in Chapter 676, 3 mini panels to take off the thing that covered his third eye, then 3 more mini panels to open his third eye which is obviously for dramatic effect. Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

And last...the novelization of both The last, Momoshiki fight, AND Sakura's hiden say he's faster than he was during the war. So already being faster than Madara, which we did get to see, plus all that. Then yeah he's faster. \n\nIt's a who hits first. \n\nAlso it isn't stated that he knows the hand seals.

I dropped the disaster that is Boruto, so here is where I will concede. I will still stand by that by the end of the Naruto manga, Madara still stomps Naruto. \n\n4.

It wouldn\u2019t work on Naruto because no one has ever tried to use genjutsu on 6PSM Naruto. Madara, Obito(hax near koto level base genjutsu), and Sasuke never even attempted genjutsu on Naruto. They could have but didn\u2019t. Especially Sasuke with the Rinnegan(wayyy stronger genjutsu than Koto). If they didn\u2019t try it, I highly doubt a much weaker Uchiha could pull off a genjutsu on Naruto. Naruto also uses clones. Genjutsu gets baited by clones like Kakashi did to Itachi. Naruto can also fight with no eyesight so genjutsu would have no effect. Most of the kages would bait genjutsu with clones then go in with hax to win. Naruto would beat Sasuke then one shot every other Uchiha. Naruto makes the fight unfair it\u2019s too one sided. Hashirama, Naruto, Tobirama, and Minato could handle all of them while Kakashi uses clones to distract them for a tiny bit. Tsunade either gets wrecked instantly or heals the injured Kage",

Naruto clones alone could deal with Madara and Obito since he powerscales wayyyyyy higher than them. They might honestly get one shot. They can\u2019t do shit against him. He\u2019s too fast he blitzes both of them. Sasuke loses because Naruto has been known to be the stronger one by 90% of the fandom since their final fight.

Theyre 2 entities inhabiting the same body, id be surprised if they could die easily.\n\nHell during the momo arc, momo was getting pissed off that Naruto had such an extra huge amount of chakra and was taking too long to extract, if I remember he says that he had only just gotten to the halfway point of Narutos chakra. That already says alot about what Naruto can do compared to Sasuke in that regard.\n\nNaruto has all the tailed beasts and their respective powers and nature releases excluding Gyuki I think, Naruto cmhas more power and could beat anyone through brute force. Sasuke is the actual skilled combatant out of the two as shown in their fight when Naruto had to use an abundance of clones and substitution to even get through the EMS and Rinnegan",

Naruto is also extremely skilled in taijutsu and in extremely unpredictable. Naruto can still use Ashura avatar which stalemated Juubi susanoo. Sasuke can\u2019t use Juubi susanoo anymore. It\u2019s not Juubi but it\u2019s all the tailed beasts ya get the idea. Honestly I\u2019d really like to say Sasuke wins since I like him more, I just can\u2019t see him doing any long lasting damage to Naruto. Especially since Naruto has counters to all of his abilities. Sorry if I come across mean. Honestly I\u2019d want the Uchiha to win but I think putting an invincible multiple light speed level + multi continental giga chad against someone who can split a mountain a little ridiculous.",

We have no idea if Sasuke can use that chakra anymore just like we don't know if Naruto technically can use six paths chakra anymore. \n\nAlso teen Rinn Sasuke was fighting based on anger, revenge and spite, Adult Sasuke has none of that and has 15 years more experience and has fought more varied enemies than Naruto. And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful. Also assuming this is a completely bloodlusted but still in character fight, Naruto would worry about others before himself which is a major weakness. Personally I like both characters with Sasuke a little more and whenever I see adult sasuke vs kage Naruto I dont eve see how Naruto wins.",

And as this version of him is alive, has no buffs other than what is inherent in his current body, (saying it isn\u2019t him bcs its not the body he was born in is like saying prime Orochimaru was during the 3rd war bcs he was still his own body then) that is his current Base form prime. Those are just the facts.\n\nHis right as an incarnation of Ashura is Dojutsu, which includes the Rinnegan just like Sasuke, and as such Jutsu cast by his rinnegan are part of his power. \n\n\nMinato\u2019s Edo isn\u2019t his prime because he was dead, but resurrected Madara was alive",

Literally no other member stacks up to either of them.\n\nBasically is either:\nSasuke seals everyone like he did to the bijuu and he is assisted by 6 dudes to beat Naruto.\nSasuke can also drain the chakra of all other Hokage.\n\nOr:\nSasuke does the above, but this time Naruto also one-shots every Uchiha but Sasuke, which becomes the End of the Series fight. However, Sasuke doesn't have the Bijuu and just the Hokage, so maybe Naruto has an easier time.\n\nRegardless, the only winning factor is if Naruto or Sasuke win.",

Orochimaru would have to release it but the 4 Kage undoubtedly have plenty of ways to deal with him. Suigetsu and Jugo aren\u2019t really a factor either. With Hashirama using Wood, Tobi and Minato using Flying Rajin, Hashi and Minato using Sage, Minato using Kyuubi, and Hiruzen having all five basic releases, the first 4 Kage pretty much have all their bases covered except for ocular power.

Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

I also think 100 Healings is pretty cool. But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other. You really don\u2019t see the same kind of interwoven combos with the Uchiha, aside from Izuna/Madara and Sasuke/Itachi or Itachi/Shisui. No clue who the sixth Uchiha is.",

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

If we\u2019re doing full composite, then we need to break down each character at their absolute strongest and go from there. Just going off of the photo, however, the Kage stomp. Reason for that is Madara and Itachi are both depicted in their alive forms. Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list. No matter which Uchiha makes it to the end, it\u2019ll be 7 on 1, which none of the Uchiha can handle as they are depicted.",

However, Obito doesn\u2019t have his other Sharingan, so he won\u2019t be able to spam Kamui like Kakashi does. And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

When Kakashi temporarily inherited Obito's Sharingan, he blitzes Kaguya and slashes her in half. In both power and speed, Kaguya scales above Rinne-Sharingan Madara who scales above Juubito by a considerable amount. \n\n>Shisui have a pair of Koto, he can genjutsu GG two of them, commands Hiruzen to commit sepuku \n\nThere is no way Shisui is going to defeat Hiruzen--the second person to be dubbed \"God of Shinobi\" and a man who knows all the Jutsu in the Konoha archives. Even when he was an old man and way out of his prime, he was regarded as the strongest Kage among the other living Kages which includes Onoki and Unruly A. As for Tsunade, perhaps, but Shisui got his eye taken by Danzo who is only stronger than Tsunade if he uses Izanagi. \n\n>Itachi have Tsukuyomi and only one Koto, he can genjutsu GG one of them with Koto, makes that Minato, then he can torture Tobirama with Tsukuyomi by making him live in a dream where he is the Uchihas' slave \n\nNo, just no... It is not possible for alive/sick Itachi to counter the Flying Raijin which is used by both Minato and Tobirama and he doesn't have enough stamina to keep up Susanoo before he gets finished by a Rasengan. The only plausible state Itachi could win would be Edo Tensei Itachi with unlimited chakra, but then Minato would get KCM so I doubt he could win this scenario either.",

The only characters that were stronger in their Edo Tensei state was Itachi because he was mortally ill and Minato because he sealed half of Kurama's chakra inside him when he died. For the record, we know enough about Tobirama that he's no pushover. He killed Izuna who was regarded as an equal to Madara at the time of his death. I think this statement is a little hyperbolic, but he should at least be relative to MS Madara. \n\n>even weak ass skeleton-only Susanoo can tank a thousand rasengan, but Minato have zero counter to Kotoamatsukami\n\nWhat I meant was that Itachi would not be able to sustain his Susanoo for very long with his stamina. It's highly unlikely Itachi could hit Minato with Totsuka Blade before he was wore out.\n\n>Tobirama no zero counter to Tsukuyomi = fact \n\nTobirama fought and killed various Uchiha prior to the peace agreement.

Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi.

In the manga its more of a Kaguya is surprised he can phase, therefore he took advantage of her shocked state and Kamui Raikiri her\n\nI already told you, if Hiruzen didn't have Hiraishin or Edo Tensei, that entire statement of him having every non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from the Leaf is a contradiction. And honestly I don't care about off screen feats at all, just like Kakashi 1000 jutsus, so lets end this argument which will go nowhere \n\nItachi when he left the village = 13 years old, Itachi when he died = 21 years old \n\nso you're not gonna convinced me healthy prime Itachi didn't exist, before he contracted his illness \n\nespecially when you use such a bias argument for Tobirama, using Hanzo for a freaking example \n\nfirst of all, in-lore fact, Hanzo let Mifune win, out-lore fact, Kishi said readers were complaining the Hanzo vs Mifune fight is boring in an interview \n\nsecond of all, Edo Hashirama (war arc) is as strong as Alive Hashirama, and actually showed extra feats like the Shinto Gates. Edo Minato (war arc) also showed more Hiraishin (the super long name jutsus) and Senjutsu feats than when he is alive, even if I am ignoring the Kyuubi\n\nso I am not going to let you make such a bias argument that Hanzo not living up to hype determines that alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tobirama, when Edo Hashirama and Edo Minato show more feats than their alive forms \n\nItachi kept up with KCM1 Naruto and fought alongside EMS Sasuke just fine, don't care if you think Naruto \"was just talking\", he saved Naruto's and Bee's asses from Nagato so clearly he can fight at that playing field \n\n>I'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan\n\nThank you. \n\nThat's a Might Guy's feat against a non-bloodlusted Itachi, a normal eyes field of vision is 120 degrees, that means Minato will have to look the other 240 degrees away when fighting Itachi and Kotoamatsukami was never even shown to require eyes contact as Danzo casted it on Mifune while wearing his bandages, but this will get nowhere, if you still think Minato will blitz Itachi before he can cast the genjutsu, then lets just agree to disagree",

And I doubt he could keep eye sight with the 2nd or the 4th as their literally the fastest ninja ever. Also you clearly underestimate Minato. If we\u2019re taking them at their best, like you said, then he has kcm mode. This makes him faster and he has been shown to throw some extremely destructive Resengans, REALLY BIG ONES. Also people have clearly explained this to you but you still don\u2019t get it, Obito can\u2019t kamui when he\u2019s fighting Kakashi. Not to mention the fact that Kakashis blitz is so fast it hit kaguya before she new what happened, I doubt he would have time to kamui. I think kakashi wins. Tobirama is at his best, an Uchiha killer, his pitch black Jutsu cancels all ocular abilities of the sharingan and he\u2019s not weak by any means. With all of this not to mention the fact that you matched all of these people up with their ideal candidate in your mind for the uchiha to win. Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at. And hashirama and tobirama know how to fight in it. Honestly you overestimate the uchiha and underestimated the hokage. They aren\u2019t the hokage because their pushovers",

Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye.

Sasuke broke out of tsukoyomi with no MS. Also just a heads up Infinite Tsukoyomi and Itachi's Tsukoyomi are distinctly different. If youre  under the mindset that Itachi Uchiha is planetary in terms of scaling you cant be reasoned with.  For instance Killer Bee fought against a reanimated Itachi with \"Infinite chakra\" and all he had to do was avoid looking into itachi's eyes. Naruto even stated that if he got caught by Tsukuyomi he'd be done for. This is the same Bee that got 2v1'd by Minato (the man you claim Itachi could one shot) Even with the help of Unruly A. You really think that just because a character has an ability that is capable of one shotting people they just win instantly?

Becoming a ten tail jinchurki is becoming a psuedo Sage of Six paths, a knock off version if you will. Because Naruto recieved the soul baptism whatever of his demigod reincarnation though, he became a true So6p, gaining far mkre power than Madara or Obito.\n\n>Madara will still beat him with Mugen Tsukuyomi\n\nThe thing that most people are confused about us that the Tsukyomi is not a guaranteed hit or end all be all move. While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

In reality we should be assessing ems madara since thats prior to him stealing hashis power. \n\nHashi clearly is better than ems madara\n \nNaruto at worst stalemates sasuke but you can make a very strong case he is better because he was holding back at VotE. \n\nI\u2019ll give DMS obito the win since he should be able to handle the sharingan better but kakashi is smarter and a better combatant so i can see him taking it. \n\nI doubt that shisui can use Koto twice, but we don\u2019t have any real concrete evidence for or against. He was only going to koto fugaku so that leads me to believe he can only use it on one target per specific time period. Regardless even if we give him both tsunade and hiruzen gg he\u2019s def incapacitated/ dead to minato. \n\nThe true crux of this entire 7 vs 7 is minato vs itachi. Itachi can\u2019t gg minato with tskuyomi because 1. Minato is too fast and 2. Minato is a sensor and sage. He can fight without ever looking at itachis eyes. So the real question here becomes can minato get thru/ outlast itachis susanoo. I\u2019m not really sure. Sm amped odama rasengans might be able too. Plus toad summons. But i can see outs for itachi too. \n\nThis is all with natural non gifted formes. Strongest formes is just madara solo",

I mean if we give madara rinnegan we should also give hashirama it. \n\nI tend to believe its more a restriction on the user for koto. What i mean is using it once means you have to wait to use it again even with both eyes and him being the true user. For shisui i could see it being a few days or hours restriction, itachi said it would be a decade before the crows eye could do it again, and danzo could at most only do it once a day with the assistance of hashi cells. We don\u2019t know the cooldown ramifications of shisui since its his eyes (like madara said the true power of the eyes is unlocked with the original owner).\n\nMinato might not have been a perfect sage which i think is debatable. He was able to instantly go into the mode in the middle of a battlefeild and possesed only the sage eye rings and no other features like perfect sage naruto. I think minato was being modest but regardless he can do sage mode, sm odamda rasengans are said to be able to carve away mountains in the data books and damaged Kurama, which is definitely comparable in durability to itachis susano\u2019o. Really susano\u2019os are incredibly good defence but unless u got perfect susanoo they aren\u2019t unbeatble. 5 kage sasukes susanoo was damaged ect multiple times. So was madaras by the raikage. I definitely think a sage mode amped odama rasengan can damage a non perfect susano when raikage damaged it twice and naruto damaged kurama with it in his fight.\n\nHis shield would deflect it but the rest of his susanoo can be damaged and its more of a stamina check than anything. Can minato damage susano\u2019o enough to win? I don\u2019t see itachi hitting him so its a battle of endurance.",

The exceptions aside, the only uchiha who supported the villiage didn't stand up for the villiage against their own clan. \n\nHis big mistake was not trusting Madara. Sometimes Lal it takes it a little love. Hashi showed it to Madara. If not for that eavesdropping and if he had continued to eavesdrop instead of stoping midway, he'd know that Hashi loved Him.

You talk of Genjutsu but the only person who used Genjutsu a lot in character was Itachi and again the Hokage team knows too much about the Sharingan to go in blindly with their eyes wide open. Stop it. Because that's literally like me saying can't Minato and Tobirama speed blitz the entire Uchiha team before they even know what's going on. And again Sasuke will be too preoccupied with Naruto. Naruto had a weakened Kakashi and Sakura for Christ sakes when he fought Sasuke. He now has all the Hokages including his dad who caught 8 Gates Guy before Juubi Madara could in his base form. They are not the same speed as Minato that is false. Obito never kept up with Minato that is false. And you're making an assumption that FTG does not work against Chibaku Tensei. FTG worked against Kamui.\n\nEdit: As well you are downplaying Hashi and the others. Madara in base form beat the Tailed Beast. So using Sasuke Chibaku tensei feat is really not a big deal.

The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

These are smart ninja the best of the best in Konoha. No offense but everyone on the Uchiha team are second bests. Itachi is literally their best weapon next to Sasuke and Itachi can't Izanagi and izanami the whole Hokage team. Let's not forget Susanoo is chakra and Minato can teleport chakra away. I'm not saying it is a curb stomp, it will be the greatest fight. But Naruto team wins",

The feats that we did see don't add up to him beating Hokage naruto, let alone The Last. And honestly the feats we see with TEN TAILs doesn't give much promise for hokage naruto's loss either. \n\nMy fiance, who is a huge Uchiha expert legit goes on rants. And Madara is legit her second fav uchiha after Shisui. She has every novel even the japanese ones. Reads the manga left to right. And she still does not see any way Naruto would lose to Madara. Sasuke would be an issue but as long as Naruto out lasts that Rennigan he's good.",

Naruto might be battle smarts and hard work but Sasuke like he proved during the final battle is a much much better fighter.\n\nAnd what do you mean he outlasted him in the final? Do you mean when they went hand to hand and were both extremely weak? Or do you mean during the mid point when they had a fight of shadow clones and amaterasu? \n\nEither way I think Sasuke and Madara are both the deciding factors here, 2 users in their prime adult forms with rinnegan. Both have paths and both can use chibaku tensei, they're the game changers.",

And if you actually take it like it was, Sasuke had a lot less fighting in the war. He showed up in day 3. While naruto showed up way before him. He also had the bijiu to pull from. Naruto didn't. So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra. And it's shown in the manga Sasuke even feels pain from loosing it. So it's a huge distraction. \n\nSasuke didn't prove he was much better a fighter. He proved he was more skilled, and again Naruto was tired and NOT trying to kill him.",

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments.

Naruto hit Madara and the dude had to pause for a sec and then knew to dodge the next hits. \nMadara sent an attack Naruto's way and it was blocked. But Naruto's rasenshuriken went right through the dude. \n\nWhat do you had?",

You are right...Madara wins IF he gets a jutsu he had to work an entire lifetime to get. To me that's not an impressive feat. But if he gets it off Naruto is trapped. However Naruto is faster than before...by a lot. And stronger by A LOT seeing as he took a hit that destroyed the moon. Madara is not planetary level except in genjutsu. \n\nSo who ever hits first wins because I had to rewatch that scene and read it. And it does take a while to set it off. Naruto would crash through now. \nNow if we are talking about feats that impress me. Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended based on his OWN will to live... That's impressive.\n\nAdd on: let's not even go into the fact to go against Naruto he'd need another God tree fruit which is possible but that's a whole different level of wtf. Not only that but we don't know if the full ninetails can block it. It was suggested in the hiden but they can't confirm it.",

Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

It wouldn\u2019t work on Naruto because no one has ever tried to use genjutsu on 6PSM Naruto. Madara, Obito(hax near koto level base genjutsu), and Sasuke never even attempted genjutsu on Naruto. They could have but didn\u2019t. Especially Sasuke with the Rinnegan(wayyy stronger genjutsu than Koto). If they didn\u2019t try it, I highly doubt a much weaker Uchiha could pull off a genjutsu on Naruto. Naruto also uses clones. Genjutsu gets baited by clones like Kakashi did to Itachi. Naruto can also fight with no eyesight so genjutsu would have no effect. Most of the kages would bait genjutsu with clones then go in with hax to win. Naruto would beat Sasuke then one shot every other Uchiha. Naruto makes the fight unfair it\u2019s too one sided. Hashirama, Naruto, Tobirama, and Minato could handle all of them while Kakashi uses clones to distract them for a tiny bit. Tsunade either gets wrecked instantly or heals the injured Kage",

That already says alot about what Naruto can do compared to Sasuke in that regard.\n\nNaruto has all the tailed beasts and their respective powers and nature releases excluding Gyuki I think, Naruto cmhas more power and could beat anyone through brute force. Sasuke is the actual skilled combatant out of the two as shown in their fight when Naruto had to use an abundance of clones and substitution to even get through the EMS and Rinnegan",

We have no idea if Sasuke can use that chakra anymore just like we don't know if Naruto technically can use six paths chakra anymore. \n\nAlso teen Rinn Sasuke was fighting based on anger, revenge and spite, Adult Sasuke has none of that and has 15 years more experience and has fought more varied enemies than Naruto. And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful. Also assuming this is a completely bloodlusted but still in character fight, Naruto would worry about others before himself which is a major weakness. Personally I like both characters with Sasuke a little more and whenever I see adult sasuke vs kage Naruto I dont eve see how Naruto wins.",

Even his \"big\" feat with the 5 chakra natures was pretty lame, they had no form changes, just giant blobs of damage.  I guess it's supposed to be like \"Oh wow he can use all 5 natures that well!!\" but we already had Kakashi for that.\n\nAnd I don't get it cause Tobirama was given new and unique stuff.  Why not the 3rd?",

Literally no other member stacks up to either of them.\n\nBasically is either:\nSasuke seals everyone like he did to the bijuu and he is assisted by 6 dudes to beat Naruto.\nSasuke can also drain the chakra of all other Hokage.\n\nOr:\nSasuke does the above, but this time Naruto also one-shots every Uchiha but Sasuke, which becomes the End of the Series fight. However, Sasuke doesn't have the Bijuu and just the Hokage, so maybe Naruto has an easier time.\n\nRegardless, the only winning factor is if Naruto or Sasuke win.",

If she was able to punch her way through *Madara's* Susanoo, Itachi might as well not use his Susanoo for its defence.\n\nI still think Itachi wins this fight probably 8 times out of 10, but it is never going to be easy. It's hard fought each and every time.",

Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

I also think 100 Healings is pretty cool. But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other. You really don\u2019t see the same kind of interwoven combos with the Uchiha, aside from Izuna/Madara and Sasuke/Itachi or Itachi/Shisui. No clue who the sixth Uchiha is.",

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

However, Obito doesn\u2019t have his other Sharingan, so he won\u2019t be able to spam Kamui like Kakashi does. And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

                                                                    "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

He planned out the whole fight to get Kakashi to hit him in the exact spot he needed to to get Madaras seal off of his heart, and with sustaining any other damage in the process.

When Kakashi temporarily inherited Obito's Sharingan, he blitzes Kaguya and slashes her in half. In both power and speed, Kaguya scales above Rinne-Sharingan Madara who scales above Juubito by a considerable amount. \n\n>Shisui have a pair of Koto, he can genjutsu GG two of them, commands Hiruzen to commit sepuku \n\nThere is no way Shisui is going to defeat Hiruzen--the second person to be dubbed \"God of Shinobi\" and a man who knows all the Jutsu in the Konoha archives. Even when he was an old man and way out of his prime, he was regarded as the strongest Kage among the other living Kages which includes Onoki and Unruly A. As for Tsunade, perhaps, but Shisui got his eye taken by Danzo who is only stronger than Tsunade if he uses Izanagi. \n\n>Itachi have Tsukuyomi and only one Koto, he can genjutsu GG one of them with Koto, makes that Minato, then he can torture Tobirama with Tsukuyomi by making him live in a dream where he is the Uchihas' slave \n\nNo, just no... It is not possible for alive/sick Itachi to counter the Flying Raijin which is used by both Minato and Tobirama and he doesn't have enough stamina to keep up Susanoo before he gets finished by a Rasengan. The only plausible state Itachi could win would be Edo Tensei Itachi with unlimited chakra, but then Minato would get KCM so I doubt he could win this scenario either.",

Why would Hiruzen let Shisui use Kotoamatsukami?  \n\n> which part of \"strongest forms\" you can't read? we have not even seen alive Tobirama to know how much weaker he was in alive form. \n\nI did read it, however, there seems to be a debate on some of the characters \"strongest form\", especially since you think alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tensei Tobirama. The only characters that were stronger in their Edo Tensei state was Itachi because he was mortally ill and Minato because he sealed half of Kurama's chakra inside him when he died. For the record, we know enough about Tobirama that he's no pushover. He killed Izuna who was regarded as an equal to Madara at the time of his death. I think this statement is a little hyperbolic, but he should at least be relative to MS Madara. \n\n>even weak ass skeleton-only Susanoo can tank a thousand rasengan, but Minato have zero counter to Kotoamatsukami\n\nWhat I meant was that Itachi would not be able to sustain his Susanoo for very long with his stamina. It's highly unlikely Itachi could hit Minato with Totsuka Blade before he was wore out.\n\n>Tobirama no zero counter to Tsukuyomi = fact \n\nTobirama fought and killed various Uchiha prior to the peace agreement. I would find it hard to believe he wouldn't have a counter to Tsukuyomi.",

You'll have to restructure your sentence.\n\n>Because data book is retarded too, isn't Hiraishin a non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from Konoha?? What about Edo Tensei? Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

When Kakashi fell out of his Susanoo, Kaguya noticed he had not been hit before he slashed her shoulder open right at the 5:58 time stamp.\n\n>Nope, the moment that statement gets contradicted it is irrelevant. Databook = useless.\n\nEnlighten me then. How is it contradicted? I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o. So what we see of Kakshi using DMS is essentially just Obito using it in Kakashis subconscious.",

And honestly I don't care about off screen feats at all, just like Kakashi 1000 jutsus, so lets end this argument which will go nowhere \n\nItachi when he left the village = 13 years old, Itachi when he died = 21 years old \n\nso you're not gonna convinced me healthy prime Itachi didn't exist, before he contracted his illness \n\nespecially when you use such a bias argument for Tobirama, using Hanzo for a freaking example \n\nfirst of all, in-lore fact, Hanzo let Mifune win, out-lore fact, Kishi said readers were complaining the Hanzo vs Mifune fight is boring in an interview \n\nsecond of all, Edo Hashirama (war arc) is as strong as Alive Hashirama, and actually showed extra feats like the Shinto Gates. Edo Minato (war arc) also showed more Hiraishin (the super long name jutsus) and Senjutsu feats than when he is alive, even if I am ignoring the Kyuubi\n\nso I am not going to let you make such a bias argument that Hanzo not living up to hype determines that alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tobirama, when Edo Hashirama and Edo Minato show more feats than their alive forms \n\nItachi kept up with KCM1 Naruto and fought alongside EMS Sasuke just fine, don't care if you think Naruto \"was just talking\", he saved Naruto's and Bee's asses from Nagato so clearly he can fight at that playing field \n\n>I'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan\n\nThank you. \n\nThat's a Might Guy's feat against a non-bloodlusted Itachi, a normal eyes field of vision is 120 degrees, that means Minato will have to look the other 240 degrees away when fighting Itachi and Kotoamatsukami was never even shown to require eyes contact as Danzo casted it on Mifune while wearing his bandages, but this will get nowhere, if you still think Minato will blitz Itachi before he can cast the genjutsu, then lets just agree to disagree",

But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at.

Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye.

Naruto even stated that if he got caught by Tsukuyomi he'd be done for. This is the same Bee that got 2v1'd by Minato (the man you claim Itachi could one shot) Even with the help of Unruly A. You really think that just because a character has an ability that is capable of one shotting people they just win instantly? If that were the case Damn near every war arch character is top tier in the verse. Shit, Darui with sage tools one shots the 10 tails by that logic.",

I sentenced it pretty badly. \n\nNaruto told Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes and Bee still fell for it. Itachi didn't used MS against Bee, the moment he used MS he got Koto'd into changing sides.

Becoming a ten tail jinchurki is becoming a psuedo Sage of Six paths, a knock off version if you will. Because Naruto recieved the soul baptism whatever of his demigod reincarnation though, he became a true So6p, gaining far mkre power than Madara or Obito.\n\n>Madara will still beat him with Mugen Tsukuyomi\n\nThe thing that most people are confused about us that the Tsukyomi is not a guaranteed hit or end all be all move. While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

In reality we should be assessing ems madara since thats prior to him stealing hashis power. \n\nHashi clearly is better than ems madara\n \nNaruto at worst stalemates sasuke but you can make a very strong case he is better because he was holding back at VotE. \n\nI\u2019ll give DMS obito the win since he should be able to handle the sharingan better but kakashi is smarter and a better combatant so i can see him taking it. \n\nI doubt that shisui can use Koto twice, but we don\u2019t have any real concrete evidence for or against. He was only going to koto fugaku so that leads me to believe he can only use it on one target per specific time period. Regardless even if we give him both tsunade and hiruzen gg he\u2019s def incapacitated/ dead to minato. \n\nThe true crux of this entire 7 vs 7 is minato vs itachi. Itachi can\u2019t gg minato with tskuyomi because 1. Minato is too fast and 2. Minato is a sensor and sage. He can fight without ever looking at itachis eyes. So the real question here becomes can minato get thru/ outlast itachis susanoo. I\u2019m not really sure. Sm amped odama rasengans might be able too. Plus toad summons. But i can see outs for itachi too. \n\nThis is all with natural non gifted formes. Strongest formes is just madara solo",

I mean if we give madara rinnegan we should also give hashirama it. \n\nI tend to believe its more a restriction on the user for koto. What i mean is using it once means you have to wait to use it again even with both eyes and him being the true user. For shisui i could see it being a few days or hours restriction, itachi said it would be a decade before the crows eye could do it again, and danzo could at most only do it once a day with the assistance of hashi cells. We don\u2019t know the cooldown ramifications of shisui since its his eyes (like madara said the true power of the eyes is unlocked with the original owner).\n\nMinato might not have been a perfect sage which i think is debatable. He was able to instantly go into the mode in the middle of a battlefeild and possesed only the sage eye rings and no other features like perfect sage naruto. I think minato was being modest but regardless he can do sage mode, sm odamda rasengans are said to be able to carve away mountains in the data books and damaged Kurama, which is definitely comparable in durability to itachis susano\u2019o. Really susano\u2019os are incredibly good defence but unless u got perfect susanoo they aren\u2019t unbeatble. 5 kage sasukes susanoo was damaged ect multiple times. So was madaras by the raikage. I definitely think a sage mode amped odama rasengan can damage a non perfect susano when raikage damaged it twice and naruto damaged kurama with it in his fight.\n\nHis shield would deflect it but the rest of his susanoo can be damaged and its more of a stamina check than anything. Can minato damage susano\u2019o enough to win? I don\u2019t see itachi hitting him so its a battle of endurance.",

The exceptions aside, the only uchiha who supported the villiage didn't stand up for the villiage against their own clan. \n\nHis big mistake was not trusting Madara. Sometimes Lal it takes it a little love. Hashi showed it to Madara. If not for that eavesdropping and if he had continued to eavesdrop instead of stoping midway, he'd know that Hashi loved Him.

You talk of Genjutsu but the only person who used Genjutsu a lot in character was Itachi and again the Hokage team knows too much about the Sharingan to go in blindly with their eyes wide open. Stop it. Because that's literally like me saying can't Minato and Tobirama speed blitz the entire Uchiha team before they even know what's going on. And again Sasuke will be too preoccupied with Naruto. Naruto had a weakened Kakashi and Sakura for Christ sakes when he fought Sasuke. He now has all the Hokages including his dad who caught 8 Gates Guy before Juubi Madara could in his base form. They are not the same speed as Minato that is false. Obito never kept up with Minato that is false. And you're making an assumption that FTG does not work against Chibaku Tensei. FTG worked against Kamui.\n\nEdit: As well you are downplaying Hashi and the others. Madara in base form beat the Tailed Beast. So using Sasuke Chibaku tensei feat is really not a big deal.

The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

                                                    "body": "1) Your whole argument is a speculation. Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

Do you mean when they went hand to hand and were both extremely weak? Or do you mean during the mid point when they had a fight of shadow clones and amaterasu? \n\nEither way I think Sasuke and Madara are both the deciding factors here, 2 users in their prime adult forms with rinnegan.

And if you actually take it like it was, Sasuke had a lot less fighting in the war. He showed up in day 3. While naruto showed up way before him. He also had the bijiu to pull from. Naruto didn't. So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra. And it's shown in the manga Sasuke even feels pain from loosing it. So it's a huge distraction. \n\nSasuke didn't prove he was much better a fighter. He proved he was more skilled, and again Naruto was tired and NOT trying to kill him.",

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments.

She's very good at vs. you saying what you said shows no credibility. \n\nOn the other hand if could show some feats, like I can that'd be cool and I'd be willing to debate it. \n\nNaruto was faster than Madara and his clones kept up with the limbo clones, which shows speed, sometimes even out speeding Madara. Again like I said, this was before he unlocked boil release, which he used to speed up even further. Madara was tired at that point. Naruto wasn't. Madara DID hit Naruto and Naruto got back up and kept going. Naruto hit Madara and the dude had to pause for a sec and then knew to dodge the next hits. \nMadara sent an attack Naruto's way and it was blocked. But Naruto's rasenshuriken went right through the dude. \n\nWhat do you had?",

Madara is not planetary level except in genjutsu. \n\nSo who ever hits first wins because I had to rewatch that scene and read it. And it does take a while to set it off. Naruto would crash through now. \nNow if we are talking about feats that impress me. Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended based on his OWN will to live... That's impressive.\n\nAdd on: let's not even go into the fact to go against Naruto he'd need another God tree fruit which is possible but that's a whole different level of wtf.

Ok. \n\nWhere is it stated that Naruto is faster **by a lot** than in chapter 676? \n\nMadara 1-2 panels to fly to the sky in Chapter 676, 3 mini panels to take off the thing that covered his third eye, then 3 more mini panels to open his third eye which is obviously for dramatic effect. Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

It wouldn\u2019t work on Naruto because no one has ever tried to use genjutsu on 6PSM Naruto. Madara, Obito(hax near koto level base genjutsu), and Sasuke never even attempted genjutsu on Naruto. They could have but didn\u2019t. Especially Sasuke with the Rinnegan(wayyy stronger genjutsu than Koto). If they didn\u2019t try it, I highly doubt a much weaker Uchiha could pull off a genjutsu on Naruto. Naruto also uses clones. Genjutsu gets baited by clones like Kakashi did to Itachi. Naruto can also fight with no eyesight so genjutsu would have no effect. Most of the kages would bait genjutsu with clones then go in with hax to win. Naruto would beat Sasuke then one shot every other Uchiha. Naruto makes the fight unfair it\u2019s too one sided. Hashirama, Naruto, Tobirama, and Minato could handle all of them while Kakashi uses clones to distract them for a tiny bit. Tsunade either gets wrecked instantly or heals the injured Kage",

Sasuke is the actual skilled combatant out of the two as shown in their fight when Naruto had to use an abundance of clones and substitution to even get through the EMS and Rinnegan",

Naruto is also extremely skilled in taijutsu and in extremely unpredictable. Naruto can still use Ashura avatar which stalemated Juubi susanoo. Sasuke can\u2019t use Juubi susanoo anymore. It\u2019s not Juubi but it\u2019s all the tailed beasts ya get the idea. Honestly I\u2019d really like to say Sasuke wins since I like him more, I just can\u2019t see him doing any long lasting damage to Naruto. Especially since Naruto has counters to all of his abilities. Sorry if I come across mean. Honestly I\u2019d want the Uchiha to win but I think putting an invincible multiple light speed level + multi continental giga chad against someone who can split a mountain a little ridiculous.",

We have no idea if Sasuke can use that chakra anymore just like we don't know if Naruto technically can use six paths chakra anymore. \n\nAlso teen Rinn Sasuke was fighting based on anger, revenge and spite, Adult Sasuke has none of that and has 15 years more experience and has fought more varied enemies than Naruto. And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful. Also assuming this is a completely bloodlusted but still in character fight, Naruto would worry about others before himself which is a major weakness. Personally I like both characters with Sasuke a little more and whenever I see adult sasuke vs kage Naruto I dont eve see how Naruto wins.",

If she was able to punch her way through *Madara's* Susanoo, Itachi might as well not use his Susanoo for its defence.\n\nI still think Itachi wins this fight probably 8 times out of 10, but it is never going to be easy.

Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

I also think 100 Healings is pretty cool. But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other. You really don\u2019t see the same kind of interwoven combos with the Uchiha, aside from Izuna/Madara and Sasuke/Itachi or Itachi/Shisui. No clue who the sixth Uchiha is.",

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

If we\u2019re doing full composite, then we need to break down each character at their absolute strongest and go from there. Just going off of the photo, however, the Kage stomp. Reason for that is Madara and Itachi are both depicted in their alive forms. Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list. No matter which Uchiha makes it to the end, it\u2019ll be 7 on 1, which none of the Uchiha can handle as they are depicted.",

However, Obito doesn\u2019t have his other Sharingan, so he won\u2019t be able to spam Kamui like Kakashi does. And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

                                                            "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

The only characters that were stronger in their Edo Tensei state was Itachi because he was mortally ill and Minato because he sealed half of Kurama's chakra inside him when he died. For the record, we know enough about Tobirama that he's no pushover. He killed Izuna who was regarded as an equal to Madara at the time of his death. I think this statement is a little hyperbolic, but he should at least be relative to MS Madara. \n\n>even weak ass skeleton-only Susanoo can tank a thousand rasengan, but Minato have zero counter to Kotoamatsukami\n\nWhat I meant was that Itachi would not be able to sustain his Susanoo for very long with his stamina. It's highly unlikely Itachi could hit Minato with Totsuka Blade before he was wore out.\n\n>Tobirama no zero counter to Tsukuyomi = fact \n\nTobirama fought and killed various Uchiha prior to the peace agreement. I would find it hard to believe he wouldn't have a counter to Tsukuyomi.",

Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o. So what we see of Kakshi using DMS is essentially just Obito using it in Kakashis subconscious.",

In the manga its more of a Kaguya is surprised he can phase, therefore he took advantage of her shocked state and Kamui Raikiri her\n\nI already told you, if Hiruzen didn't have Hiraishin or Edo Tensei, that entire statement of him having every non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from the Leaf is a contradiction. And honestly I don't care about off screen feats at all, just like Kakashi 1000 jutsus, so lets end this argument which will go nowhere \n\nItachi when he left the village = 13 years old, Itachi when he died = 21 years old \n\nso you're not gonna convinced me healthy prime Itachi didn't exist, before he contracted his illness \n\nespecially when you use such a bias argument for Tobirama, using Hanzo for a freaking example \n\nfirst of all, in-lore fact, Hanzo let Mifune win, out-lore fact, Kishi said readers were complaining the Hanzo vs Mifune fight is boring in an interview \n\nsecond of all, Edo Hashirama (war arc) is as strong as Alive Hashirama, and actually showed extra feats like the Shinto Gates. Edo Minato (war arc) also showed more Hiraishin (the super long name jutsus) and Senjutsu feats than when he is alive, even if I am ignoring the Kyuubi\n\nso I am not going to let you make such a bias argument that Hanzo not living up to hype determines that alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tobirama, when Edo Hashirama and Edo Minato show more feats than their alive forms \n\nItachi kept up with KCM1 Naruto and fought alongside EMS Sasuke just fine, don't care if you think Naruto \"was just talking\", he saved Naruto's and Bee's asses from Nagato so clearly he can fight at that playing field \n\n>I'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan\n\nThank you. \n\nThat's a Might Guy's feat against a non-bloodlusted Itachi, a normal eyes field of vision is 120 degrees, that means Minato will have to look the other 240 degrees away when fighting Itachi and Kotoamatsukami was never even shown to require eyes contact as Danzo casted it on Mifune while wearing his bandages, but this will get nowhere, if you still think Minato will blitz Itachi before he can cast the genjutsu, then lets just agree to disagree",

And I doubt he could keep eye sight with the 2nd or the 4th as their literally the fastest ninja ever. Also you clearly underestimate Minato. If we\u2019re taking them at their best, like you said, then he has kcm mode. This makes him faster and he has been shown to throw some extremely destructive Resengans, REALLY BIG ONES. Also people have clearly explained this to you but you still don\u2019t get it, Obito can\u2019t kamui when he\u2019s fighting Kakashi. Not to mention the fact that Kakashis blitz is so fast it hit kaguya before she new what happened, I doubt he would have time to kamui. I think kakashi wins. Tobirama is at his best, an Uchiha killer, his pitch black Jutsu cancels all ocular abilities of the sharingan and he\u2019s not weak by any means. With all of this not to mention the fact that you matched all of these people up with their ideal candidate in your mind for the uchiha to win. Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at. And hashirama and tobirama know how to fight in it. Honestly you overestimate the uchiha and underestimated the hokage. They aren\u2019t the hokage because their pushovers",

Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye.

If youre  under the mindset that Itachi Uchiha is planetary in terms of scaling you cant be reasoned with.  For instance Killer Bee fought against a reanimated Itachi with \"Infinite chakra\" and all he had to do was avoid looking into itachi's eyes. Naruto even stated that if he got caught by Tsukuyomi he'd be done for. This is the same Bee that got 2v1'd by Minato (the man you claim Itachi could one shot) Even with the help of Unruly A.

Because Naruto recieved the soul baptism whatever of his demigod reincarnation though, he became a true So6p, gaining far mkre power than Madara or Obito.\n\n>Madara will still beat him with Mugen Tsukuyomi\n\nThe thing that most people are confused about us that the Tsukyomi is not a guaranteed hit or end all be all move. While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

I mean if we give madara rinnegan we should also give hashirama it. \n\nI tend to believe its more a restriction on the user for koto. What i mean is using it once means you have to wait to use it again even with both eyes and him being the true user. For shisui i could see it being a few days or hours restriction, itachi said it would be a decade before the crows eye could do it again, and danzo could at most only do it once a day with the assistance of hashi cells. We don\u2019t know the cooldown ramifications of shisui since its his eyes (like madara said the true power of the eyes is unlocked with the original owner).\n\nMinato might not have been a perfect sage which i think is debatable. He was able to instantly go into the mode in the middle of a battlefeild and possesed only the sage eye rings and no other features like perfect sage naruto. I think minato was being modest but regardless he can do sage mode, sm odamda rasengans are said to be able to carve away mountains in the data books and damaged Kurama, which is definitely comparable in durability to itachis susano\u2019o. Really susano\u2019os are incredibly good defence but unless u got perfect susanoo they aren\u2019t unbeatble. 5 kage sasukes susanoo was damaged ect multiple times. So was madaras by the raikage. I definitely think a sage mode amped odama rasengan can damage a non perfect susano when raikage damaged it twice and naruto damaged kurama with it in his fight.\n\nHis shield would deflect it but the rest of his susanoo can be damaged and its more of a stamina check than anything. Can minato damage susano\u2019o enough to win? I don\u2019t see itachi hitting him so its a battle of endurance.",

Sometimes Lal it takes it a little love. Hashi showed it to Madara. If not for that eavesdropping and if he had continued to eavesdrop instead of stoping midway, he'd know that Hashi loved Him.

Stop it. Because that's literally like me saying can't Minato and Tobirama speed blitz the entire Uchiha team before they even know what's going on. And again Sasuke will be too preoccupied with Naruto. Naruto had a weakened Kakashi and Sakura for Christ sakes when he fought Sasuke. He now has all the Hokages including his dad who caught 8 Gates Guy before Juubi Madara could in his base form. They are not the same speed as Minato that is false. Obito never kept up with Minato that is false. And you're making an assumption that FTG does not work against Chibaku Tensei. FTG worked against Kamui.\n\nEdit: As well you are downplaying Hashi and the others. Madara in base form beat the Tailed Beast. So using Sasuke Chibaku tensei feat is really not a big deal.

The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

                                            "body": "1) Your whole argument is a speculation. Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

Do you mean when they went hand to hand and were both extremely weak?

And if you actually take it like it was, Sasuke had a lot less fighting in the war. He showed up in day 3. While naruto showed up way before him. He also had the bijiu to pull from. Naruto didn't. So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra. And it's shown in the manga Sasuke even feels pain from loosing it. So it's a huge distraction. \n\nSasuke didn't prove he was much better a fighter. He proved he was more skilled, and again Naruto was tired and NOT trying to kill him.",

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments. You'd have to seriously push Naruto to even attempt to empty his tank of fuel.\n\nHell even after momoshiki took about half, he STILL lost.",

However Naruto is faster than before...by a lot. And stronger by A LOT seeing as he took a hit that destroyed the moon. Madara is not planetary level except in genjutsu. \n\nSo who ever hits first wins because I had to rewatch that scene and read it. And it does take a while to set it off. Naruto would crash through now. \nNow if we are talking about feats that impress me. Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended based on his OWN will to live... That's impressive.\n\nAdd on: let's not even go into the fact to go against Naruto he'd need another God tree fruit which is possible but that's a whole different level of wtf. Not only that but we don't know if the full ninetails can block it. It was suggested in the hiden but they can't confirm it.",

Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

They could have but didn\u2019t. Especially Sasuke with the Rinnegan(wayyy stronger genjutsu than Koto). If they didn\u2019t try it, I highly doubt a much weaker Uchiha could pull off a genjutsu on Naruto. Naruto also uses clones. Genjutsu gets baited by clones like Kakashi did to Itachi. Naruto can also fight with no eyesight so genjutsu would have no effect. Most of the kages would bait genjutsu with clones then go in with hax to win. Naruto would beat Sasuke then one shot every other Uchiha. Naruto makes the fight unfair it\u2019s too one sided. Hashirama, Naruto, Tobirama, and Minato could handle all of them while Kakashi uses clones to distract them for a tiny bit. Tsunade either gets wrecked instantly or heals the injured Kage",

That already says alot about what Naruto can do compared to Sasuke in that regard.\n\nNaruto has all the tailed beasts and their respective powers and nature releases excluding Gyuki I think, Naruto cmhas more power and could beat anyone through brute force.

And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful. Also assuming this is a completely bloodlusted but still in character fight, Naruto would worry about others before himself which is a major weakness.

As the Rinne rebirth was a Jutsu cast by his OWN eye, I see that is counts as him just using a Jutsu to bring himself back into the fight with more power. And as this version of him is alive, has no buffs other than what is inherent in his current body, (saying it isn\u2019t him bcs its not the body he was born in is like saying prime Orochimaru was during the 3rd war bcs he was still his own body then) that is his current Base form prime. Those are just the facts.\n\nHis right as an incarnation of Ashura is Dojutsu, which includes the Rinnegan just like Sasuke, and as such Jutsu cast by his rinnegan are part of his power. \n\n\nMinato\u2019s Edo isn\u2019t his prime because he was dead, but resurrected Madara was alive",

Literally no other member stacks up to either of them.\n\nBasically is either:\nSasuke seals everyone like he did to the bijuu and he is assisted by 6 dudes to beat Naruto.\nSasuke can also drain the chakra of all other Hokage.\n\nOr:\nSasuke does the above, but this time Naruto also one-shots every Uchiha but Sasuke, which becomes the End of the Series fight. However, Sasuke doesn't have the Bijuu and just the Hokage, so maybe Naruto has an easier time.\n\nRegardless, the only winning factor is if Naruto or Sasuke win.",

If she was able to punch her way through *Madara's* Susanoo, Itachi might as well not use his Susanoo for its defence.\n\nI still think Itachi wins this fight probably 8 times out of 10, but it is never going to be easy.

Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy.

But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other.

Obito and Itachi could have one too. They\u2019ve worked together but they\u2019ve never fought side by side. So prolly not",

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list.

The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

                                                    "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

I mean, you only need to look at his fight with Kakashi. He planned out the whole fight to get Kakashi to hit him in the exact spot he needed to to get Madaras seal off of his heart, and with sustaining any other damage in the process.

It's been explicitly shown that it takes time to teleport himself. If Kakashi can blitz Kaguya, Obito is not going to be able to react. \n\n>P1 hype don't mean shit, Shisui have two Kotoamatsukamis = fact, Kotoamatsukami gg \n\nI agree that Hiruzen's reputation precedes him, but it's stated in the data books he possess every Jutsu from Konoha with the exception of Kekkei Genkai. Why would Hiruzen let Shisui use Kotoamatsukami?  \n\n> which part of \"strongest forms\" you can't read? we have not even seen alive Tobirama to know how much weaker he was in alive form. \n\nI did read it, however, there seems to be a debate on some of the characters \"strongest form\", especially since you think alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tensei Tobirama. The only characters that were stronger in their Edo Tensei state was Itachi because he was mortally ill and Minato because he sealed half of Kurama's chakra inside him when he died. For the record, we know enough about Tobirama that he's no pushover. He killed Izuna who was regarded as an equal to Madara at the time of his death. I think this statement is a little hyperbolic, but he should at least be relative to MS Madara. \n\n>even weak ass skeleton-only Susanoo can tank a thousand rasengan, but Minato have zero counter to Kotoamatsukami\n\nWhat I meant was that Itachi would not be able to sustain his Susanoo for very long with his stamina. It's highly unlikely Itachi could hit Minato with Totsuka Blade before he was wore out.\n\n>Tobirama no zero counter to Tsukuyomi = fact \n\nTobirama fought and killed various Uchiha prior to the peace agreement. I would find it hard to believe he wouldn't have a counter to Tsukuyomi.",

You'll have to restructure your sentence.\n\n>Because data book is retarded too, isn't Hiraishin a non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from Konoha?? What about Edo Tensei? Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

Databook = useless.\n\nEnlighten me then. How is it contradicted? I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o.

Sasuke broke out of tsukoyomi with no MS. Also just a heads up Infinite Tsukoyomi and Itachi's Tsukoyomi are distinctly different. If youre  under the mindset that Itachi Uchiha is planetary in terms of scaling you cant be reasoned with.  For instance Killer Bee fought against a reanimated Itachi with \"Infinite chakra\" and all he had to do was avoid looking into itachi's eyes. Naruto even stated that if he got caught by Tsukuyomi he'd be done for. This is the same Bee that got 2v1'd by Minato (the man you claim Itachi could one shot) Even with the help of Unruly A. You really think that just because a character has an ability that is capable of one shotting people they just win instantly? If that were the case Damn near every war arch character is top tier in the verse. Shit, Darui with sage tools one shots the 10 tails by that logic.",

Becoming a ten tail jinchurki is becoming a psuedo Sage of Six paths, a knock off version if you will. Because Naruto recieved the soul baptism whatever of his demigod reincarnation though, he became a true So6p, gaining far mkre power than Madara or Obito.\n\n>Madara will still beat him with Mugen Tsukuyomi\n\nThe thing that most people are confused about us that the Tsukyomi is not a guaranteed hit or end all be all move. While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

I mean if we give madara rinnegan we should also give hashirama it. \n\nI tend to believe its more a restriction on the user for koto. What i mean is using it once means you have to wait to use it again even with both eyes and him being the true user. For shisui i could see it being a few days or hours restriction, itachi said it would be a decade before the crows eye could do it again, and danzo could at most only do it once a day with the assistance of hashi cells. We don\u2019t know the cooldown ramifications of shisui since its his eyes (like madara said the true power of the eyes is unlocked with the original owner).\n\nMinato might not have been a perfect sage which i think is debatable. He was able to instantly go into the mode in the middle of a battlefeild and possesed only the sage eye rings and no other features like perfect sage naruto. I think minato was being modest but regardless he can do sage mode, sm odamda rasengans are said to be able to carve away mountains in the data books and damaged Kurama, which is definitely comparable in durability to itachis susano\u2019o. Really susano\u2019os are incredibly good defence but unless u got perfect susanoo they aren\u2019t unbeatble. 5 kage sasukes susanoo was damaged ect multiple times. So was madaras by the raikage. I definitely think a sage mode amped odama rasengan can damage a non perfect susano when raikage damaged it twice and naruto damaged kurama with it in his fight.\n\nHis shield would deflect it but the rest of his susanoo can be damaged and its more of a stamina check than anything. Can minato damage susano\u2019o enough to win? I don\u2019t see itachi hitting him so its a battle of endurance.",

So Sasuke (and Naruto) are around that level of speed.\n\nHence, my point that Naruto and Sasuke powercliff everyone very badly, and Sasuke can probably clap his hands, genjutsu the Hokage and seal them in chibaku tensei. They wouldn't be able to escape by simply FTG.\n\nAlso reminder that teen Obito can keep up with Minato, to further back up the notion that Sasuke wouldn't get blitzed by him.",

You talk of Genjutsu but the only person who used Genjutsu a lot in character was Itachi and again the Hokage team knows too much about the Sharingan to go in blindly with their eyes wide open. Stop it. Because that's literally like me saying can't Minato and Tobirama speed blitz the entire Uchiha team before they even know what's going on. And again Sasuke will be too preoccupied with Naruto. Naruto had a weakened Kakashi and Sakura for Christ sakes when he fought Sasuke. He now has all the Hokages including his dad who caught 8 Gates Guy before Juubi Madara could in his base form. They are not the same speed as Minato that is false. Obito never kept up with Minato that is false. And you're making an assumption that FTG does not work against Chibaku Tensei. FTG worked against Kamui.\n\nEdit: As well you are downplaying Hashi and the others. Madara in base form beat the Tailed Beast. So using Sasuke Chibaku tensei feat is really not a big deal.

                            "body": "TLDR: I think Uchihas winning is less speculative than Hokage winning, not to say Hokage can't win in some cases.  \n\n\nSasuke is stronger than  Nagato, and his Chibaku Tensei does not have a black sphere. The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

                                    "body": "1) Your whole argument is a speculation. Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra.

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments.

Again like I said, this was before he unlocked boil release, which he used to speed up even further. Madara was tired at that point. Naruto wasn't.

Naruto hit Madara and the dude had to pause for a sec and then knew to dodge the next hits. \nMadara sent an attack Naruto's way and it was blocked.

Naruto would crash through now. \nNow if we are talking about feats that impress me. Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended based on his OWN will to live...

Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

It wouldn\u2019t work on Naruto because no one has ever tried to use genjutsu on 6PSM Naruto. Madara, Obito(hax near koto level base genjutsu), and Sasuke never even attempted genjutsu on Naruto. They could have but didn\u2019t. Especially Sasuke with the Rinnegan(wayyy stronger genjutsu than Koto). If they didn\u2019t try it, I highly doubt a much weaker Uchiha could pull off a genjutsu on Naruto. Naruto also uses clones. Genjutsu gets baited by clones like Kakashi did to Itachi. Naruto can also fight with no eyesight so genjutsu would have no effect. Most of the kages would bait genjutsu with clones then go in with hax to win. Naruto would beat Sasuke then one shot every other Uchiha. Naruto makes the fight unfair it\u2019s too one sided. Hashirama, Naruto, Tobirama, and Minato could handle all of them while Kakashi uses clones to distract them for a tiny bit. Tsunade either gets wrecked instantly or heals the injured Kage",

And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful.

As the Rinne rebirth was a Jutsu cast by his OWN eye, I see that is counts as him just using a Jutsu to bring himself back into the fight with more power. And as this version of him is alive, has no buffs other than what is inherent in his current body, (saying it isn\u2019t him bcs its not the body he was born in is like saying prime Orochimaru was during the 3rd war bcs he was still his own body then) that is his current Base form prime. Those are just the facts.\n\nHis right as an incarnation of Ashura is Dojutsu, which includes the Rinnegan just like Sasuke, and as such Jutsu cast by his rinnegan are part of his power. \n\n\nMinato\u2019s Edo isn\u2019t his prime because he was dead, but resurrected Madara was alive",

Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other. You really don\u2019t see the same kind of interwoven combos with the Uchiha, aside from Izuna/Madara and Sasuke/Itachi or Itachi/Shisui. No clue who the sixth Uchiha is.",

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list. No matter which Uchiha makes it to the end, it\u2019ll be 7 on 1, which none of the Uchiha can handle as they are depicted.",

The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

                                            "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

You'll have to restructure your sentence.\n\n>Because data book is retarded too, isn't Hiraishin a non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from Konoha?? What about Edo Tensei? Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o.

In the manga its more of a Kaguya is surprised he can phase, therefore he took advantage of her shocked state and Kamui Raikiri her\n\nI already told you, if Hiruzen didn't have Hiraishin or Edo Tensei, that entire statement of him having every non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from the Leaf is a contradiction. And honestly I don't care about off screen feats at all, just like Kakashi 1000 jutsus, so lets end this argument which will go nowhere \n\nItachi when he left the village = 13 years old, Itachi when he died = 21 years old \n\nso you're not gonna convinced me healthy prime Itachi didn't exist, before he contracted his illness \n\nespecially when you use such a bias argument for Tobirama, using Hanzo for a freaking example \n\nfirst of all, in-lore fact, Hanzo let Mifune win, out-lore fact, Kishi said readers were complaining the Hanzo vs Mifune fight is boring in an interview \n\nsecond of all, Edo Hashirama (war arc) is as strong as Alive Hashirama, and actually showed extra feats like the Shinto Gates. Edo Minato (war arc) also showed more Hiraishin (the super long name jutsus) and Senjutsu feats than when he is alive, even if I am ignoring the Kyuubi\n\nso I am not going to let you make such a bias argument that Hanzo not living up to hype determines that alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tobirama, when Edo Hashirama and Edo Minato show more feats than their alive forms \n\nItachi kept up with KCM1 Naruto and fought alongside EMS Sasuke just fine, don't care if you think Naruto \"was just talking\", he saved Naruto's and Bee's asses from Nagato so clearly he can fight at that playing field \n\n>I'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan\n\nThank you. \n\nThat's a Might Guy's feat against a non-bloodlusted Itachi, a normal eyes field of vision is 120 degrees, that means Minato will have to look the other 240 degrees away when fighting Itachi and Kotoamatsukami was never even shown to require eyes contact as Danzo casted it on Mifune while wearing his bandages, but this will get nowhere, if you still think Minato will blitz Itachi before he can cast the genjutsu, then lets just agree to disagree",

And I doubt he could keep eye sight with the 2nd or the 4th as their literally the fastest ninja ever. Also you clearly underestimate Minato. If we\u2019re taking them at their best, like you said, then he has kcm mode. This makes him faster and he has been shown to throw some extremely destructive Resengans, REALLY BIG ONES. Also people have clearly explained this to you but you still don\u2019t get it, Obito can\u2019t kamui when he\u2019s fighting Kakashi. Not to mention the fact that Kakashis blitz is so fast it hit kaguya before she new what happened, I doubt he would have time to kamui. I think kakashi wins. Tobirama is at his best, an Uchiha killer, his pitch black Jutsu cancels all ocular abilities of the sharingan and he\u2019s not weak by any means. With all of this not to mention the fact that you matched all of these people up with their ideal candidate in your mind for the uchiha to win. Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at. And hashirama and tobirama know how to fight in it. Honestly you overestimate the uchiha and underestimated the hokage. They aren\u2019t the hokage because their pushovers",

I sentenced it pretty badly. \n\nNaruto told Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes and Bee still fell for it. Itachi didn't used MS against Bee, the moment he used MS he got Koto'd into changing sides. MS Itachi would one shot Bee 4 different ways. \n\n>You really think that just because a character has an ability that is capable of one shotting people they just win instantly\n\nIf the opponent have no way to counter it? Yes, Itachi one shot Minato easily. Madara Mugen Tsukuyomi one shot the whole world except Kaguya, Sasuke and Edos.",

Becoming a ten tail jinchurki is becoming a psuedo Sage of Six paths, a knock off version if you will. Because Naruto recieved the soul baptism whatever of his demigod reincarnation though, he became a true So6p, gaining far mkre power than Madara or Obito.\n\n>Madara will still beat him with Mugen Tsukuyomi\n\nThe thing that most people are confused about us that the Tsukyomi is not a guaranteed hit or end all be all move. While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

You talk of Genjutsu but the only person who used Genjutsu a lot in character was Itachi and again the Hokage team knows too much about the Sharingan to go in blindly with their eyes wide open. Stop it. Because that's literally like me saying can't Minato and Tobirama speed blitz the entire Uchiha team before they even know what's going on. And again Sasuke will be too preoccupied with Naruto. Naruto had a weakened Kakashi and Sakura for Christ sakes when he fought Sasuke. He now has all the Hokages including his dad who caught 8 Gates Guy before Juubi Madara could in his base form. They are not the same speed as Minato that is false. Obito never kept up with Minato that is false. And you're making an assumption that FTG does not work against Chibaku Tensei. FTG worked against Kamui.\n\nEdit: As well you are downplaying Hashi and the others. Madara in base form beat the Tailed Beast. So using Sasuke Chibaku tensei feat is really not a big deal. Hell Hashi raped tailed beast for a living",

                    "body": "TLDR: I think Uchihas winning is less speculative than Hokage winning, not to say Hokage can't win in some cases.  \n\n\nSasuke is stronger than  Nagato, and his Chibaku Tensei does not have a black sphere. The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

                            "body": "1) Your whole argument is a speculation. Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra.

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments.

To me that's not an impressive feat. But if he gets it off Naruto is trapped. However Naruto is faster than before...by a lot. And stronger by A LOT seeing as he took a hit that destroyed the moon. Madara is not planetary level except in genjutsu. \n\nSo who ever hits first wins because I had to rewatch that scene and read it. And it does take a while to set it off. Naruto would crash through now. \nNow if we are talking about feats that impress me. Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended based on his OWN will to live... That's impressive.\n\nAdd on: let's not even go into the fact to go against Naruto he'd need another God tree fruit which is possible but that's a whole different level of wtf. Not only that but we don't know if the full ninetails can block it. It was suggested in the hiden but they can't confirm it.",

Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful.

And when the Hokages were reanimated they were not 100% per Orochimaru",

As the Rinne rebirth was a Jutsu cast by his OWN eye, I see that is counts as him just using a Jutsu to bring himself back into the fight with more power. And as this version of him is alive, has no buffs other than what is inherent in his current body, (saying it isn\u2019t him bcs its not the body he was born in is like saying prime Orochimaru was during the 3rd war bcs he was still his own body then) that is his current Base form prime. Those are just the facts.\n\nHis right as an incarnation of Ashura is Dojutsu, which includes the Rinnegan just like Sasuke, and as such Jutsu cast by his rinnegan are part of his power. \n\n\nMinato\u2019s Edo isn\u2019t his prime because he was dead, but resurrected Madara was alive",

Like I said, the mere power clash of Hashi and Tobi even had Orochimaru worried. And Hashirama dealt with Madara before. Plus it\u2019s not like Sasuke himself had a way to deal with the Edo Tensei. Orochimaru would have to release it but the 4 Kage undoubtedly have plenty of ways to deal with him. Suigetsu and Jugo aren\u2019t really a factor either. With Hashirama using Wood, Tobi and Minato using Flying Rajin, Hashi and Minato using Sage, Minato using Kyuubi, and Hiruzen having all five basic releases, the first 4 Kage pretty much have all their bases covered except for ocular power. Plus Minato has a slew of Sealing Jutsu at his disposal.",

She\u2019d have to cut off the affected area and heal.\n\nI don't know anything about the Kashin Koji thing. Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Homage have a one person advantage and they can send one Hokage to double team one of the Uchiha. Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other. You really don\u2019t see the same kind of interwoven combos with the Uchiha, aside from Izuna/Madara and Sasuke/Itachi or Itachi/Shisui. No clue who the sixth Uchiha is.",

But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui.

                                    "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

You'll have to restructure your sentence.\n\n>Because data book is retarded too, isn't Hiraishin a non-Kekkei Genkai jutsu from Konoha?? What about Edo Tensei? Still Kotoamatsukami gg\n\nI can understand not liking the data books, but that doesn't invalidate them. Yes, Hiruzen should know Hiraishin/Flying Raijin and Edo Tensei. He doesn't possess Kekkei Genkai and probably does not know specific bloodline/clan Jutsus like Aburame insects. The Eight Inner Gates are debatable too. However, this doesn't change the fact that his arsenal is massive and he has speed and AP advantage over Shisui.\n\n>Okay I see, basically your argument is that Itachi's \"strongest form\", going by your logic, isn't his Edo form because Edo Tensei heavily helps him, but somehow Edo Tobirama is as strong as alive Tobirama? I know you didn't directly say it, but you are heavily implying it.\n\nTo reiterate, Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone. Alive Tobirama is stronger than Edo Tensei Tobirama for the fact that Edo-Shinobi are not reincarnated at their full power.\n\nEdo Itachi > Alive Itachi\n\nEdo Tobirama < Alive Tobirama\n\n>since both of their strongest *alive* forms are in ambiguity, its only logical to use their Edo forms which was actually shown on manga panels. Thirdly, Izuna have no feats.\n\nThe flashbacks of the Shinobi clan wars where we saw Tobirama fight and kill Izuna is canon. That's a feat. Izuna being \"equal\" to Madara at that time is an author's statement so you can't just disregard that.\n\n>I never said Itachi can hit Minato with Totsuka Blade, he is going to genjutsu gg both of them with Koto and Tsukuyomi.\n\nThat doesn't change the situation. Minato is not going to let himself get hit by Koto from Itachi, let alone if it's in the body of a raven. Even if he did get stunned or mind-controlled, Jinchiriki users have already demonstrated to be able to break Genjutsus since the will of the Kyuubi is independent of the person they inhabit.\n\n>Also, Tsukuyomi is Itachi exclusive (aside from Madara/Kaguya on a planetary scale) unless stated otherwise, MS Sasuke didn't have Tsukuyomi as stated by Danzo.\n\nFair enough. I still don't think Tobirama is going to topple over like a leaf and it is improbable Tsukuyomi is the only Sharingan Genjutsu. However, if your premise is Tobirama has no resistance or counter, sure, Itachi could win.",

I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o.

And I doubt he could keep eye sight with the 2nd or the 4th as their literally the fastest ninja ever. Also you clearly underestimate Minato. If we\u2019re taking them at their best, like you said, then he has kcm mode. This makes him faster and he has been shown to throw some extremely destructive Resengans, REALLY BIG ONES. Also people have clearly explained this to you but you still don\u2019t get it, Obito can\u2019t kamui when he\u2019s fighting Kakashi. Not to mention the fact that Kakashis blitz is so fast it hit kaguya before she new what happened, I doubt he would have time to kamui. I think kakashi wins. Tobirama is at his best, an Uchiha killer, his pitch black Jutsu cancels all ocular abilities of the sharingan and he\u2019s not weak by any means. With all of this not to mention the fact that you matched all of these people up with their ideal candidate in your mind for the uchiha to win. Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at. And hashirama and tobirama know how to fight in it. Honestly you overestimate the uchiha and underestimated the hokage. They aren\u2019t the hokage because their pushovers",

While it is a very powerful genjutsu powered by a rinnegan, it is still in the end a genjutsu that can be countered.\n\nNaruto is one of those people who can counter it, even before becoming a So6p, due to having the consciounes of kurama inside of him allowing him to break free almost instantly, a trait all jinchuriki share. \n\nAfter becoming the So6p, Naruto by himself is now immune to genjutsus as well.",

            "body": "TLDR: I think Uchihas winning is less speculative than Hokage winning, not to say Hokage can't win in some cases.  \n\n\nSasuke is stronger than  Nagato, and his Chibaku Tensei does not have a black sphere. The rubble gathers around the target instead. If every Chibaku Tensei is equally powerful, then Sasuke wouldn't have used it later on against Momoshiki for instance.\n\nSasuke also uses genjutsu, just because he also uses a whole array of techniques doesn't make him not use it. he will use genjutsu if needed: He used genjutsu against Itachi, C, and even the Bijuu. Hell, I am claiming this scenario just because he did something similar to the Bijuu in only one glance as Hagoromo said.\n\nHasirama and Tobirama fought Uchihas in a daily basis and Naruto is a perfect Jinchuuriki, so we can claim they have genjutsu resistance, but nothing can be said for the others. Let alone a genjutsu from the strongest Rinnegan user.\n\nI don't understand the Sakura/Kakashi argument (?) Like, Naruto wasn't protecting them in that fight. Sakura and Kakashi were just talking and then Naruto and Sasuke just ran off to the Valley of the End.\n\nNaruto having his allies is less impactful than Sasuke having allies because the Hokage don't really have any type of supporting role other than raw power:FTG on Naruto, more nature energy, Wood Release hack (and Death Reaper, but Hiruzen couldn't pull orochimaru's soul out, let alone SSP Sasuke.)In contrast, the supporting Uchihas have: Amaterasu, Izanagi and Izanami (yes, Itachi's explanation makes no sense on how Uchihas use it without Senju power but we are rolling with it), Kotoamatsukami, Totsuka Blade (can't Itachi give Sasuke the Totsuka blade; also Naruto is the only one who knows about it), Kamui.Don't get me wrong, Naruto/Sasuke are still like 95% of the fight, but Sasuke has a better supporting group.\n\nMy point with Teen Obito is that, if he ever came near to keep up Minato, then certainly a SSP Rinnegan Sasuke would. In fact, in that fight against 8 Gates Guy, Madara never really had trouble blocking/dodging, he even stood still and let him connect the Night Guy. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke were really not that worried about fighting him (considering he also absorbed the God Tree), and only began to have trouble keeping up with Kaguya.\n\nAlso, yes, FTC would work against Chibaku Tensei if they aren't trapped in a genjutsu fist.\n\nI don't think I am downplaying the Hokage. They are very powerful, but the power scale skyrocketed immensely with SSP. When Naruto saves Guy, Madara thinks he is only weakened, but then he realizes that, in fact, Naruto got a powerboost that put him on par to 8 Gates Guy if not more.\n\nIn conclusion, some of the scenarios I see are, from more-to-least likely:a) Every Hokage gets genjutsu-sealed but Naruto, giving Naruto a very hard time, but still with a slim chance.b) FTG Blitz, to which Sasuke retaliates by also killing everyone but Naruto, and we get Valley of the End 2.0c) Naruto amps all Hokage and proceeds to hard carry them with Shadow Clones.d) Kotoamatsukami to Naruto for instant Uchiha win.e) etc....\n\nThere are the same number of scenarios IMO , but I think Uchihas winning seems less speculative.",

                    "body": "1) Your whole argument is a speculation. Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra.

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments. You'd have to seriously push Naruto to even attempt to empty his tank of fuel.\n\nHell even after momoshiki took about half, he STILL lost.",

And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful. Also assuming this is a completely bloodlusted but still in character fight, Naruto would worry about others before himself which is a major weakness.

Yeah that's the thing, I think her healing can at least last long enough to outpace Amaterasu for as long the fight.\n\n> Totsuka blade would be able to hit her. She is not faster or smarter than Itachi.\n\nWe know that Itachi's Susanoo is incredibly slow. We also know that dodging is Tsunade's whole shtick. She's not fast like a Kakashi type, but she can dodge.\n\n>  She also can\u2019t counter Tsukuyomi and Itachi\u2019s overall combat ability.\n\nI agree that she can't counter Tsukuyomi but she's also been through two wars and countless missions. She has a ton of experience and a lot of knowledge of the Sharingan as someone from Konoha. She's not getting hit by it easily, especially knowing what it did to Kakashi. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she often scales with Sakura, who is a prodigy at dealing with Genjutsu. Sakura was not affected by Itachi's Ephemeral. It's not certain but it's very likely that Itachi will only be able to affect her with a Mangekyou level Genjutsu.\n\nLike I said, Itachi is almost definitely winning this but it's not easy. You're selling her mad short.",

But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

Itachi\u2019s a tough win but the bigger threats are Madara and Obito.  As far as Itachi goes, his Totsuka blade isn\u2019t instant. It has to be aimed and extend. And the Yata Mirror isn\u2019t omnidirectional. Plus you have to remember Itachi\u2019s illness that probably diminishes his overall performance. If he pushes himself too hard, he\u2019s roasted. Minato can easily outstrip him and any other Uchiha, scaling all the way back from the 3rd War when he juked Ay with ease. Couple him with Tsunade and Itachi is hard pressed to win relying on Susano\u2019o.\n\nDiscounting Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o as a threat, Itachi\u2019s true threat comes from Tsukuyomi and Izanami. It really comes down to if it\u2019s a team brawl or if they split off into one on one matchups and who matches up with whom. I can see the Kage being able to combo off of each other very well. They\u2019re basically a line of master and students. Hashirama and Tobirama to Hiruzen to Tsunade. Jiraya down to Minato to Kakashi to Naruto. Hashirama, Tobirama, and Hiruzen can play off of each other. Hiruzen and Minato can play off of each other. Minato, Kakashi, and Naruto can play off of each other. You really don\u2019t see the same kind of interwoven combos with the Uchiha, aside from Izuna/Madara and Sasuke/Itachi or Itachi/Shisui. No clue who the sixth Uchiha is.",

Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list.

                            "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

When Kakashi fell out of his Susanoo, Kaguya noticed he had not been hit before he slashed her shoulder open right at the 5:58 time stamp.\n\n>Nope, the moment that statement gets contradicted it is irrelevant. Databook = useless.\n\nEnlighten me then. How is it contradicted? I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o. So what we see of Kakshi using DMS is essentially just Obito using it in Kakashis subconscious.",

Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at.

Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye.

            "body": "1) Your whole argument is a speculation. Mines is based off of the strong hitters on the Uchiha side canonically losing to the heavy hitters on the Hokage side. \n\nNaruto > Sasuke\nHashi > Madara\nTobirama > Izuna\nMinato > Obito\n\nWith the exception of Itachi and Shisui who are against Kakashi and TSunade that is not speculation.\n\n\n2) There is not proof showing for or against FTG working against Chibaku tensei. I'm going off the fact that Minato out FTG Obitos Kamui and when they battled Juubito he only caught Minato because he was aiding the team and trying to figure out Juubitos powers and weakness. As well, let's still not forget, Minato at base level caught 8th Gate Guy before Juubi Madara could catch him. That is not speculation that is Minato being the fastest character in Naruto created by Kishi.\n\n\n3) Sasuke and Itachis genjutsu vs Narutos, Hashis and Minatos Sage Modes. I'm taking Naruto team. As well the Hokages have the infinite darkness technique, Naruto and Minato can literally sense ninjas without seeing them. You are comparing Bijuu without host and his little back and forth game with Itachi to the likes of the Hokages? Stop it. \n\n\n4) The argument is Naruto has support from actual Great ninja compared to before. But not just anybody, literally excluding the Aliens the most powerful ninja in the world. Yes Sasuke will have help as well but the Hokages support is literally unfair. You have Hashi, Tsunade and Naruto who all have heal factors and then you have Minato and Tobirama who can spam FTG attacks and teleport any member on their team at any given time i.e kamui attacks etc.\n\n\n5) You just low balled the Hokage, which just ended this debate. Saying the Hokage have just raw power is like saying the Uchiha only have Susano. Let's start with pure intelligence, Hokages got that one, Uchiha only have Itachi as he is literally the only person who was not manipulated on the Uchiha side. Madara doesn't take orders, Sasuke acts on emotion, Obito only had a plan because Madara aka really Black Zetsu planned it. Minato is a genius, Kakashi is a genius, Tobirama is underrated when it comes to thinking ability. I think you forgot that Tobirama has Reanimation, FTG and a whole array of forbidden Jutsu. Hashi has heal factor, sage mode, and wood style that curbstomps Madara. Minato and Hiruzen have reaper death seals. Don't forget FTG which is faster than Kamui, toad summoning, 4 sage mode users. TSunade has heal factor as well. \n\n6) Amatseru is too slow for the Hokage team. As even Bee and A avoided them. Izanagi and Izanami can't work on the whole team and once used say good bye to Itachi or Obitos eyes. Saying can't Itachi give Sasuke his Susano blade is like saying Can't Minato give Naruto his FTG Kurenei, which now Naruto in his ultimate Bijuu mode can use FTG. So no to Itachi giving Sasukes Susanoo the blade. And that's also like saying since Susano is chakra can't Minato and Tobirama just FTG the Susanoos away. Like I said for support Hokages have way better Support. It is actually the Uchiha who will have to go on the attack because the Hokages are going to spam and heal the whole fight if they don't. When you have Minato and Tobirama literally FTG'ing everything the Uchiha throw at them, while Tsunade's slugs stay on everybody healing them, Naruto and Hashi overpowered on the offensive, it's unfair. And Naruto himself can support the Hokages better than Sasuke can support the Uchiha.\n\n7) Teen Obito had a white Zetsu body and he did not keep up with Minato. Obviously Minato dodged both times with Kamui. And still proceeded to deal with Kurama. Only died to save Naruto.\n\n\nScenario Notes:  Even going with your words, if Naruto, Hashi and Tobirama are genjutsu resistant, that means Tobirama could literally teleport anyone who is caught in the genjutsu away to break them out of it. Let alone i disagree that Minato can be genjutsu due to perfect Sage mode. Let alone Hokage team pretty much knows Genjutsu. Why did Sasuke, Obito or Madara not genjutsu Naruto, Minato or Hashi if it was that easy? Because genjutsu works on weaker ninja and the bijuu. We're talking about the best of the best here good Sir! Hokages i say win 7/10 scenarios. I only see Uchihas winning if the heavy hitters get distracted by trying to save the others. But it will be extremely difficult because Kakashi and TSunade are the weaker factors compared to Shisu and Obito\n\n\nLast:  Name a person Itachi has beaten that is more powerful than Naruto, Hashi, Tobirama, Minato or Hiruzen. Remember Hiruzen would have beaten Orochimaru had he been in his prime.",

So if they were both full, no extra bijiu being held by Sasuke, his renningan would run out. Now...after training it for a LONG time he runs out far quicker than Naruto runs out of chakra.

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it. Naruto has the most chakra in the world if we go by Momoshiki's comments. You'd have to seriously push Naruto to even attempt to empty his tank of fuel.\n\nHell even after momoshiki took about half, he STILL lost.",

Other panels are some useless Sakura action, Naruto and Sasuke destroying the falling CTs, dialogues and Madara's self monologuing. \n\nSo no, it doesn't take much time to get it off. \n\nWrong, Madara stayed living after the reanimation ended because he knows the hand seals probably thanks to Tobirama, and by doing the seals in a reverse order you can break the Edo Tensei's contract. \n\nAdd on: what??",

We have no idea if Sasuke can use that chakra anymore just like we don't know if Naruto technically can use six paths chakra anymore. \n\nAlso teen Rinn Sasuke was fighting based on anger, revenge and spite, Adult Sasuke has none of that and has 15 years more experience and has fought more varied enemies than Naruto. And if we're to take Kuramas word as law and even Sasukes, Naruto doesnt see too much action as Hokage even if he's still super powerful. Also assuming this is a completely bloodlusted but still in character fight, Naruto would worry about others before himself which is a major weakness. Personally I like both characters with Sasuke a little more and whenever I see adult sasuke vs kage Naruto I dont eve see how Naruto wins.",

Sasuke used Amenotejikara on Naruto but couldn\u2019t damage him with a Chidori. His sword could damage Naruto. But Naruto can just regen or dodge. He has clones too. They would cancel each other out until Naruto wins due to his higher chakra reserves. Just my opinion tho. If you think Sasuke wins cuz hax I understand he could BFR Naruto possibly",

But she\u2019s not as fast or strong as Itachi. She can\u2019t dodge his shurikens. He has exploding clones and fireballs. He\u2019s good with clones. His Sharingan makes it easy to dodge her attacks. He has used a water jutsu(not that great a feat), and his base Sharingan genjutsu caught Orochimaru. The strongest Sannin. Sage Jiraiya could be argued stronger by some but Orochimaru is still really strong either way. Orochimaru almost broke the genjutsu but Itachi chopped off his hand and said he could kill him. \n\nI don\u2019t think she can dodge Amaterasu. The only character who has done that is the Raikage. She can\u2019t form a shield to defend against it either. She could break the ground and use a rock as defense but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fast enough. If Amaterasu can catch Sasuke(even tho Sasuke baited it) I think it can catch Tsunade. And even if she was healing how would she get rid of it? It would have to be sealed. She can\u2019t heal forever. She can\u2019t hit Itachi with any attacks. If she did it would be a one shot. \n\nHis susanoo yata mirror can block at least one attack. The susanoo can hit pretty fast as shown by Sasuke when he fought Danzo. You could argue she\u2019s faster than Danzo cuz he\u2019s old as hell. It can be formed fast as well. I think Totsuka Blade would be able to hit her. He was able to use it pretty well against Orochimaru\u2019s Sage snake thing and he caught Nagato off guard with. He might be able to do the same to Tsunade. Not to mention he has Yasaka Beads which launched Tsunade when Madara hit her with some.",

                    "body": "Yea one v one Itachi pretty much eats any Kage except Naruto, Hasihrama, and possibly Tobi and Minato. But that\u2019s the problem with these kinds of debates. Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list.

However, Obito doesn\u2019t have his other Sharingan, so he won\u2019t be able to spam Kamui like Kakashi does. And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

                    "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

            "body": ">Reread the chapter when Kakashi hit Kaguya, Kaguya thought her bone ash hit Kakashi, but when it went through him she was surprised and got hit\n\nAre you talking about [this scene](https://youtu.be/Nc37K3cBB2o?t=344)? When Kakashi fell out of his Susanoo, Kaguya noticed he had not been hit before he slashed her shoulder open right at the 5:58 time stamp.\n\n>Nope, the moment that statement gets contradicted it is irrelevant. Databook = useless.\n\nEnlighten me then. How is it contradicted? I agree with the sentiment that it's highly debatable on where you draw the line of what Jutsu he knew i.e. just the ancient scrolls passed down or all the Jutsu used until Minato became Hokage.\n\n>Ignored everything I wrote about Itachi huh, ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER AND BLOODLUSTED WAS NEVER SHOWN, THEREFORE EDO ITACHI IS USED TO SHOWCASE THAT.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, so I'm just going to lay it all out.\n\nI wrote, \"Itachi is stronger in his Edo Tensei form because his most crippling weakness is now gone\". It was implied Itachi had a respiratory disease (based on the symptoms) that he acquired sometime after or shortly before leaving Konoha. The wiki states *At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.*\n\nCase in point, \"ALIVE HEALTHY ITACHI AT FULL POWER\" never existed because his Jutsu would've been at its peak as an adult after he joined the Akatsuki. Can we agree Edo Itachi is his strongest form?\n\n>Alive Tobirama's only feat is a panel where he Hiraishin'd Izuna, a jutsu he does in his Edo form also, so how in the hell does that show Alive Tobirama > Edo Tobirama?\n\nYou're right, we don't have a full glimpse of what Tobirama was capable of in his prime, but we know he must've been stronger while alive than when he was resurrected by Orochimaru. There is more than one occasion where Edo-Shinobi were described as weaker than their former selves. It's also pretty apparent since a Shinobi like Hanzo who soloed the Legendary Sanin in the Second Shinobi War was taken down by a Samurai. Another example is when Madara was restored to his alive state and manhandled the Bijuu and alliance while blind. If that doesn't convince you, read the bottom panel of [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j8AHWgGuOoU/V9YoZ05_YII/AAAAAAADTnk/4r6whF8Frls9vZPkhrktpwbQmIjTlSAhACHM/s16000/0657-015.png).\n\n>Tsukuyomi is instantaneous, once you get hit its over, there is no cancelling the effects (right after Lady Chiyo said they can just dispel the genjutsu by helping each other cancel the genjutsu)  \n>  \n>So no, Tsukuyomi would definitely one shot Minato, and Kotoamatsukami controls you without you even realizing it.\n\nI'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan, however, it can be avoided simply by not gazing into Itachi's eyes (as demonstrated by Maito Gai). Even if Minato did not know better, he could likely blitz Itachi before his pupils even dilate. If you don't believe me, refer to [this clip](https://youtu.be/hWqweyUXIrQ?t=54). In addition, KCM brings Minato's base speed up to a whole other level. We can infer this is true by Naruto's encounter with the Raikage in which fatigued Naruto outmaneuvered A while buffed with Raiton no Yoroi. I'm not pedantic enough to get into the calculations, but this power scale is adequate enough to recognize Minato's speed potential.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o. So what we see of Kakshi using DMS is essentially just Obito using it in Kakashis subconscious.",

And honestly I don't care about off screen feats at all, just like Kakashi 1000 jutsus, so lets end this argument which will go nowhere \n\nItachi when he left the village = 13 years old, Itachi when he died = 21 years old \n\nso you're not gonna convinced me healthy prime Itachi didn't exist, before he contracted his illness \n\nespecially when you use such a bias argument for Tobirama, using Hanzo for a freaking example \n\nfirst of all, in-lore fact, Hanzo let Mifune win, out-lore fact, Kishi said readers were complaining the Hanzo vs Mifune fight is boring in an interview \n\nsecond of all, Edo Hashirama (war arc) is as strong as Alive Hashirama, and actually showed extra feats like the Shinto Gates. Edo Minato (war arc) also showed more Hiraishin (the super long name jutsus) and Senjutsu feats than when he is alive, even if I am ignoring the Kyuubi\n\nso I am not going to let you make such a bias argument that Hanzo not living up to hype determines that alive Tobirama is weaker than Edo Tobirama, when Edo Hashirama and Edo Minato show more feats than their alive forms \n\nItachi kept up with KCM1 Naruto and fought alongside EMS Sasuke just fine, don't care if you think Naruto \"was just talking\", he saved Naruto's and Bee's asses from Nagato so clearly he can fight at that playing field \n\n>I'll concede that there is no way to deflect Tsukuyomi and the cast time is instantaneous after he has switched to Mangekyo Sharingan\n\nThank you. \n\nThat's a Might Guy's feat against a non-bloodlusted Itachi, a normal eyes field of vision is 120 degrees, that means Minato will have to look the other 240 degrees away when fighting Itachi and Kotoamatsukami was never even shown to require eyes contact as Danzo casted it on Mifune while wearing his bandages, but this will get nowhere, if you still think Minato will blitz Itachi before he can cast the genjutsu, then lets just agree to disagree",

This makes him faster and he has been shown to throw some extremely destructive Resengans, REALLY BIG ONES. Also people have clearly explained this to you but you still don\u2019t get it, Obito can\u2019t kamui when he\u2019s fighting Kakashi. Not to mention the fact that Kakashis blitz is so fast it hit kaguya before she new what happened, I doubt he would have time to kamui. I think kakashi wins. Tobirama is at his best, an Uchiha killer, his pitch black Jutsu cancels all ocular abilities of the sharingan and he\u2019s not weak by any means. With all of this not to mention the fact that you matched all of these people up with their ideal candidate in your mind for the uchiha to win. Naruto by himself claps all of them except Sasuke and Madara. He definitely beats Madara and hashirama is definitely gonna fuck Madara up. But the catch is this is ideally a team fight, and the mix of abilities the hokage have, and the fact naruto Can cloak them give the hokage a major advantage against the uchiha. In The blackness jutsu, Minato and Naruto Can track using emotions as naruto demonstrated in the war. Kakashi Can use his ninja hounds to let him know where people are at. And hashirama and tobirama know how to fight in it. Honestly you overestimate the uchiha and underestimated the hokage. They aren\u2019t the hokage because their pushovers",

They were both going for killing blows during the entire fight, naruto just didn't have his heart in it...he still did it.\n\nAlso sasuke only runs out of it because hes straining himself to teleport dimensions, and he's not just teleporting himself, recently he teleportswhole groups so of course he feels pain from it.

No he wasn't shown to be way faster and stronger in the Last, and honestly you can't compare manga to an anime only storyline anyway, its all up to the animators. \n\n3. I dropped the disaster that is Boruto, so here is where I will concede. I will still stand by that by the end of the Naruto manga, Madara still stomps Naruto. \n\n4. Fighting Hashirama for his cells, planning and manipulation is effort, at least more effort than Naruto dying then being gifted Demigod powers.",

Hell chakra mode isn't even explained and why only Naruto and Toneri can access it, all we can do is guess which isnt a canon reason.",

Sasuke used Amenotejikara on Naruto but couldn\u2019t damage him with a Chidori. His sword could damage Naruto. But Naruto can just regen or dodge. He has clones too. They would cancel each other out until Naruto wins due to his higher chakra reserves. Just my opinion tho. If you think Sasuke wins cuz hax I understand he could BFR Naruto possibly",

And as this version of him is alive, has no buffs other than what is inherent in his current body, (saying it isn\u2019t him bcs its not the body he was born in is like saying prime Orochimaru was during the 3rd war bcs he was still his own body then) that is his current Base form prime. Those are just the facts.\n\nHis right as an incarnation of Ashura is Dojutsu, which includes the Rinnegan just like Sasuke, and as such Jutsu cast by his rinnegan are part of his power. \n\n\nMinato\u2019s Edo isn\u2019t his prime because he was dead, but resurrected Madara was alive",

Not just the lack of information about what level of power they have or forms or what part of the story they\u2019re from, but also people just break it down into one v ones and that can lead to fight fixing to give whichever team you support an easy win. But any Uchiha against Tsunade and she loses. Then again she\u2019s not exactly a solo fighter. Her true power comes out when she\u2019s supporting a team. She\u2019s a support/healer/tank character, not a full frontline fighter.\n\nThat\u2019s also a very good point. Tobirama, Hashirama, and Minato can set up and maintain very good battlefield control. If Tobi and Minato can tag the Uchiha with seals, then the Kage are in a very good position to win. Additionally, Minato is a genius with dealing jutsu. And if it\u2019s a death match, Tobi, Hiruzen, and Minato can all use Reaper Death. Imagine if they used it against Madara, Sasuke, and Itachi, it\u2019ll be 4v3. I\u2019ve no doubt Hashirama could bully any of the remaining Uchiha like Izuna or Obito. You still have Naruto and with Sasuke removed, there\u2019s not really anyone else that can match him. Him and Kakashi can pair up against Obito and Kage Naruto should be superior to his EoS self. Hashirama makes light work of Izuna, joins Tsunade against Shisui and the remaining Uchiha. From there it\u2019s just a mop up job for the Kage. Shisui\u2019s only threat is Koto, and he can only use it twice if we give him both eyes. But if we make allowances for him, then we can make allowances for anyone else. Like Edo Sage Kyuubi Minato who is an even more massive threat than Alive Minato was.",

Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list. No matter which Uchiha makes it to the end, it\u2019ll be 7 on 1, which none of the Uchiha can handle as they are depicted.",

However, Obito doesn\u2019t have his other Sharingan, so he won\u2019t be able to spam Kamui like Kakashi does. And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

            "body": "So we\u2019re ignoring Kakashi\u2019s growth from Land of Waves all the way up to 4th War? Or are you saying that Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all between those two fights and Zabuza and Kakashi actually didn\u2019t go all out in their first fight? Kakashi showed much better feats between those two points that would\u2019ve allowed him to body Zabuza back in Land of Waves. What happened at the end of the 4th War was Kakashi got big amps, not growth. DMS SoSP is a major amp, not a natural growth of power like he had before that. And if Zabuza wasn\u2019t Edo in their second fight (and if it wasn\u2019t for emotional story purposes) Kakashi would\u2019ve absolutely bodied Zabuza. Saying Kakashi didn\u2019t grow at all until EoS throws the whole Land of Waves fight into serious scrutiny. \n\nBut if you need proof of Kakashi\u2019s growth, just look at his Sharingan. He went from being exhausted using the base 3 tomoe during his fight with Zabuza to being able to spam Kamui during the 4th War. And if you take lore into account, Kakashi had Mangekyo back when he was a teen. It unlocked when Rin died, just as Obito\u2019s did. So going off of Lore, Kakashi had the Mangekyo when he fought Zabuza the first time. Of course we know one out of story reason why he didn\u2019t use it and one in story speculation as to why he didn\u2019t. Out of story, Kishimoto simply hadn\u2019t come up with Mangekyo yet. In story, however, we can assume Kakashi tried it once and realized he didn\u2019t have the strength to use it at all. But then he busted it out against Deidara and used it from then on, which also shows natural growth. No matter how you justify it, Kakashi was stronger before his DMS amps than he was in Land of Waves. And Zabuza died back then. He didn\u2019t have the two and half years of additional experience and training that Kakashi had. And it\u2019s common knowledge that Edos aren\u2019t exactly at their full strength they had while they were alive. Their benefit is not being able to be outright killed like a living person. That\u2019s why Kakashi couldn\u2019t just one shot Zabuza during their second fight. He had to stall out until Zabuza could be sealed away. Going full throttle to kill like in Land of Waves wasn\u2019t an option. Not to mention Kakashi knew he needed to conserve strength for the rest of the war. He\u2019s not stupid enough to throw all of his strength into one measly fight when there\u2019s thousands of Zetsy and dozens of Edos to handle.\n\nAlso, to answer the Kage comment, the OP literally depicts Hokage Kakashi. He\u2019s a Kage level fighter as a Hokage. Unless you\u2019re going to try to argue that Kakashi is still weaker than Kage level despite being a Kage?? So if you still say Zabuza is equal to Kage Kakashi, then you\u2019re saying Zabuza is a Kage level fighter. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you\u2019d just have to prove that Zabuza at his peak was a legitimate Kage level fighter. And if you can prove that, then you\u2019d have to go along with Kakashi being a Kage level fighter back in Land of Waves since he went toe to toe with Zabuza. And if you believe that, then you\u2019d basically be saying that Kakashi is above Kage level by EoS due to his growth throughout the series. \n\nIt\u2019s just easier to prove Kakashi and Zabuza were below Kage level in Land of Waves, then Kakashi built up to that level over the entire series, until he became Hokage. Whereas Zabuza had NO growth due to dying at the beginning of the series. It\u2019s not Dragonball where you can go to the afterlife and keep training with Kais.",

Basically canceling him out.\n\n And all kakashi would need to do for the first one is just send a clone that has enough chakra for a lightning blade which at worst is 1/4th of his chakra meaning he retains 75%, (it would be higher considering how much he was able to spam that shit in the war).",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

Literally anyone who obtains both of Obitos mangekyou become top 10 on the power scale immediately because with both there's almost zero counters.\n\nThe reason Obito didnt take his sharingan back is said to be because he still cared for Kakashi a bit (even though he strait up says he doesn't) and also that would look a bit suspicious. In reality the reason is because if Obito took back his eye he would be far more unfightable than he already was. Obito is essentially hacking already, and once that man gains the ability of perfect susanoo and his long range kamui he essentially becomes god.\n\nIt was a plot device to nerf Obito, and the fact that a pretty \"average\" (compared to some characters we see in the war) guy like Kakashi was able to land a hit on Kaguya says slot about Obito's Mangekyou.\n\nObito's strongest form is DMS, and hes definetly more skilled with it than Kakashi. When Kakashi used DMS it was essentially Obito+Kakashi, since it was Obitos chakra controlling the susano'o. So what we see of Kakshi using DMS is essentially just Obito using it in Kakashis subconscious.",

Ergo Itachi still has his sickness and Madara was still bodied by Hashirama and doesn\u2019t have Edo, Cells, SoSP, etc. In that case, the only real threat is Sasuke and Naruto would keep him busy. Hashirama would tackle Madara, Tobi takes Izuna. Tsunade and Minato can keep Itachi busy, Kakashi takes Obito, Hiruzen stalls Shisui. Once Tobi handles Izuna, he can aid anyone freely and help overwhelm a second Uchiha, which dominos into more Kage joining the next fight on the list.

The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

I dropped the disaster that is Boruto, so here is where I will concede. I will still stand by that by the end of the Naruto manga, Madara still stomps Naruto. \n\n4.

They would cancel each other out until Naruto wins due to his higher chakra reserves. Just my opinion tho. If you think Sasuke wins cuz hax I understand he could BFR Naruto possibly",

The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

Basically canceling him out.\n\n And all kakashi would need to do for the first one is just send a clone that has enough chakra for a lightning blade which at worst is 1/4th of his chakra meaning he retains 75%, (it would be higher considering how much he was able to spam that shit in the war).",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye.

And to be fair, Kakashi didn\u2019t really use Kamui when he fought Obito one v one. The most he used of the Sharingan was precognition but he knows Obito well enough that I don\u2019t think he would do poorly without it. He\u2019s the best choice after Minato to stall Obito until another Hokage can assist him. And even if he loses, it will only even up the numbers, assuming no one else was beaten yet. \n\nThe main issue with Obito is his intangibility but Minato figured that out within minutes of their fight. I\u2019m sure Kakashi has even more intimate knowledge of it\u2019s capabilities, having held the second half himself. \n\nAnd to be fair to the Uchiha, if it was a battle with everyone at the height of their power, the Uchiha stomp via SoSP Madara. The only one with a chance against him is Kage Naruto but with an equally powered Sasuke there, Naruto won\u2019t have much of a chance to do anything to Madara. Plus Edo Itachi is dangerous since he isn\u2019t ill and can spam his Sharingan abilities all he likes.\n\nTl;dr as depicted, Hokage take the win. At full power composite, the Uchiha take it.",

Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

I'm not talking about him teleporting a rasengan and walking through obito, I'm saying that if he uses the same intangibility as obito theoretically it would render it useless.\n\n\n>I thought Shadow Clones always divide chakra evenly, if you make one clone you divide by half, if you make two clones you divide by 1/3 and so on. Kakashi said the Lighting clone depleted half of his chakra also. and a normal clone is just illusion with no potential for physical attack.\n\nThat's just something that people do when making shadow clones, you kinda need chakra to be equally split otherwise people would know who's the clone and who isn't, I'm very sure that it's choice to decide how much chakra goes into a clone. Plus if the clone was too weak it would be useless anyway. Also if that wasn't even the case, he could make 3 clones then recall 2, taking the chakra of both of them and leaving a 1/4 shadow clone.",

Itachi programmed shishuis eye to use koto on itachis eyes when sasuke took them to protect the leaf but ended up using it on himself. Shishui is the only known uchiha with the ability to use koto, a simply research will show you that (I believe the info is around the Danzo fight or when itachi is reanimate, i don\u2019t recall completely) but Danzo uses shishuis eye for koto (even the mist village person recognized it as shishuis eye with his buyakugan) and the eye in the crow with itachi is shishuis eye. So if itachi is using koto it means shishui is blind... \n\nAlso I bring up there base forms because the op said the scenario was in there baseform otherwise jyuubis are op asf.",
