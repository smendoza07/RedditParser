It's *conceivable* that Itachi was actually a mastermind good guy all along and was working against hidden evils in the village, but idk man, he's pretty much a pure villain up to Shippuden.  He tortures both Kakashi and Sasuke over and over and over for really no reason.\n\nI think the original plan for Itachi was keeping Sasuke alive to take his eyes.  Stealing eyes was obviously planned early on because of Kakashi.  However, I think the idea of humanizing an antagonist and giving new meaning to earlier parts in the series ended up being seen as a more interesting plot point (IMO it absolutely is) and the Eye-theft was pushed to another antagonist (who wasn't planned from the start).\n\nJust pure speculation on my part, but it's the main reason I roll my eyes when people want to rewatch original Naruto to see good guy Itachi with a new meaning behind him.  Like, eh, he's still a really bad guy at that point.",

And also, he did have to make it super believable, because if Sasuke had any reservations about killing Itachi, Itachi wouldn\u2019t have been able to extract Orochimaru from him.",

Regular trauma, even as fucked up as having both of your parents killed by your brother, isn't necessarily going to set you on a path of revenge. I think the tsukuyomi was insurance. Itachi probably wanted to directly connect to Sasuke's brain and shape it in the way he thought he needed to, leaving no doubt that Sasuke would go down the path he did. Very fucked up situation but the fact that Itachi suffered immensely from having to do all of this is canon.",

If killing makes you bad, then no one in that show was good... especially Kakashi.\n\nHashirama had to kill Madara (or so he thought) so I guess he was a bad guy too.\n\nEven Itachi's parents commented on how kind and gentle Itachi his. They saw his goodness even though he was taking their lives.\n\nThe innocent civilians part is speculation because almost everyone was in on the plan, and technically, Obito coulda been the ones to kill them (haha kidding here) but letting them live will create hatred and revenge vs the village anyway, like with Sasuke.\n\nBut as for torturing Sasuke, this was when Itachi wasnt written to become what he eventually became, so yeah going that far was excessive.

Even if there were kids younger that had to die too, they're in a ninja world where killing is alright and doing whatever you had to do was simply that. My point was Itachi didn't want to kill a single member of his clan, and had to kill them all for the sake of the village (and the world).",

Itachi wanted to achieve peace but he dismissed the idea of getting help from others simply out of stubbornness that it was solely his own problem to solve or he doesn\u2019t have the necessary connections. Hiruzen? he flat out distrusted him on not taking the extreme route. Jiraiya? No way of contacting nor does he know the guy. Kakashi? Itachi looked up to him as a trustworthy senior but he wasn\u2019t at Shisui levels of trust. In short, his entourage consists of very few people.

It's *conceivable* that Itachi was actually a mastermind good guy all along and was working against hidden evils in the village, but idk man, he's pretty much a pure villain up to Shippuden.  He tortures both Kakashi and Sasuke over and over and over for really no reason.\n\nI think the original plan for Itachi was keeping Sasuke alive to take his eyes.  Stealing eyes was obviously planned early on because of Kakashi.  However, I think the idea of humanizing an antagonist and giving new meaning to earlier parts in the series ended up being seen as a more interesting plot point (IMO it absolutely is) and the Eye-theft was pushed to another antagonist (who wasn't planned from the start).\n\nJust pure speculation on my part, but it's the main reason I roll my eyes when people want to rewatch original Naruto to see good guy Itachi with a new meaning behind him.  Like, eh, he's still a really bad guy at that point.",

And also, he did have to make it super believable, because if Sasuke had any reservations about killing Itachi, Itachi wouldn\u2019t have been able to extract Orochimaru from him.",

Regular trauma, even as fucked up as having both of your parents killed by your brother, isn't necessarily going to set you on a path of revenge. I think the tsukuyomi was insurance. Itachi probably wanted to directly connect to Sasuke's brain and shape it in the way he thought he needed to, leaving no doubt that Sasuke would go down the path he did. Very fucked up situation but the fact that Itachi suffered immensely from having to do all of this is canon.",

If killing makes you bad, then no one in that show was good... especially Kakashi.\n\nHashirama had to kill Madara (or so he thought) so I guess he was a bad guy too.\n\nEven Itachi's parents commented on how kind and gentle Itachi his. They saw his goodness even though he was taking their lives.\n\nThe innocent civilians part is speculation because almost everyone was in on the plan, and technically, Obito coulda been the ones to kill them (haha kidding here) but letting them live will create hatred and revenge vs the village anyway, like with Sasuke.\n\nBut as for torturing Sasuke, this was when Itachi wasnt written to become what he eventually became, so yeah going that far was excessive.

It's *conceivable* that Itachi was actually a mastermind good guy all along and was working against hidden evils in the village, but idk man, he's pretty much a pure villain up to Shippuden.  He tortures both Kakashi and Sasuke over and over and over for really no reason.\n\nI think the original plan for Itachi was keeping Sasuke alive to take his eyes.  Stealing eyes was obviously planned early on because of Kakashi.  However, I think the idea of humanizing an antagonist and giving new meaning to earlier parts in the series ended up being seen as a more interesting plot point (IMO it absolutely is) and the Eye-theft was pushed to another antagonist (who wasn't planned from the start).\n\nJust pure speculation on my part, but it's the main reason I roll my eyes when people want to rewatch original Naruto to see good guy Itachi with a new meaning behind him.  Like, eh, he's still a really bad guy at that point.",

Regular trauma, even as fucked up as having both of your parents killed by your brother, isn't necessarily going to set you on a path of revenge. I think the tsukuyomi was insurance. Itachi probably wanted to directly connect to Sasuke's brain and shape it in the way he thought he needed to, leaving no doubt that Sasuke would go down the path he did. Very fucked up situation but the fact that Itachi suffered immensely from having to do all of this is canon.",

You asked if there even were babies when Itachi killed everyone. So i said what kind of clan with hundreds of people wouldn't make babies in so many years. I said 8 years because Sasuke was 7 when the massacre happened + 9 month pregnancy \u2248 8 years. Hence me saying it would be a huge plot hole and you couldn't even understand that, yet you talk about logic hahaha what a joke.

Why would 8 years matter if a baby should be <1-2 years at the time of the massacre? By your logic, some kids could be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or even 8 but younger than Sasuke and still be considered a baby, since that's what you said. You call me pathetic and yet you're this stupid.. well at least it's consistent.\n\nAgain, your morality being drawn at babies and not \"killing anyone\" is also highly convenient thinking. It's just interesting to see your logic in play here. And now since you're gonna be all flustered and embarrassed, things are just gonna devolve more from here on so your reply to this probably wont warrant my continued response.\n\nI'll preemptively just say take care now.",

You asked if there even were babies when Itachi killed everyone. So i said what kind of clan with hundreds of people wouldn't make babies in so many years.

And your definition of 'baby' being under 8 years is a bit strange. \n\nWhy did Danzou specifically offer to save Sasuke for Itachi and not those other kids possibly younger than him too if they existed?\n\nPs. Even if there were kids younger that had to die too, they're in a ninja world where killing is alright and doing whatever you had to do was simply that. My point was Itachi didn't want to kill a single member of his clan, and had to kill them all for the sake of the village (and the world).",

You call me pathetic and yet you're this stupid.. well at least it's consistent.\n\nAgain, your morality being drawn at babies and not \"killing anyone\" is also highly convenient thinking. It's just interesting to see your logic in play here.

Even if there were kids younger that had to die too, they're in a ninja world where killing is alright and doing whatever you had to do was simply that. My point was Itachi didn't want to kill a single member of his clan, and had to kill them all for the sake of the village (and the world).",

You call me pathetic and yet you're this stupid.. well at least it's consistent.\n\nAgain, your morality being drawn at babies and not \"killing anyone\" is also highly convenient thinking. It's just interesting to see your logic in play here.

            "body": "You specified babies as your concern, then said no one had a kid in 8 years. Why would 8 years matter if a baby should be <1-2 years at the time of the massacre? By your logic, some kids could be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or even 8 but younger than Sasuke and still be considered a baby, since that's what you said. You call me pathetic and yet you're this stupid.. well at least it's consistent.\n\nAgain, your morality being drawn at babies and not \"killing anyone\" is also highly convenient thinking. It's just interesting to see your logic in play here. And now since you're gonna be all flustered and embarrassed, things are just gonna devolve more from here on so your reply to this probably wont warrant my continued response.\n\nI'll preemptively just say take care now.",
