While I understand why Hxh fans think he also took inspiration from Kurapika's character, it sort of irritates me when people think the \"revenge/clan survivor\" thing started with Kurapika. \n\nIt has always been a thing in Japanese folklore. There was a manga published in the 1960s about a ninja named Sasuke who loses his clan, leaves his village, and tries to avenge his clan. ( Sanpei Shirato) \n\nThere was also a novel in 1959 where ninja could gain power based on genetic mutations, and the eyes could cast illusions. (Futaro Yamada)",

I understand why it\u2019s bullshit Kaguya appeared out of nowhere, but on a second re watch it all starts to make sense. Even though Madara and Obito did seriously believe that they were doing things for the sake of humanity, it made no sense how warped their view was, how they could be okay with everyone locked up so Madara could be the new god. Sounds too good to be true and pretty crazy to arrive there just by taking the eyes of your brother. It makes sense Madara has been influenced by black zetzu to arrive to this conclusion. Madara was used as a pawn and in turn Obito was used as a pawn, to a scheme that was made thousands of years ago by Kaguya/ Kaguya\u2019s will (black zetzu). As far as power creep, both Naruto and Sasuke got upgraded by Hagaromo HIMSELF. The ONLY reason he came out was cause of the power of six paths Madara obtained from the 10tails. He used that as an opportunity to give his sons reincarnations the power to stop Kaguya. He straight up gave them SSG form cause they are \u201chis sons\u201d. Pretty crazy story from an arc that\u2019s just craziness after craziness. But hey if trans dude can rebirth himself out of a snake to escape harm, I guess anything is possible.",

I understand why it\u2019s bullshit Kaguya appeared out of nowhere, but on a second re watch it all starts to make sense. Even though Madara and Obito did seriously believe that they were doing things for the sake of humanity, it made no sense how warped their view was, how they could be okay with everyone locked up so Madara could be the new god. Sounds too good to be true and pretty crazy to arrive there just by taking the eyes of your brother. It makes sense Madara has been influenced by black zetzu to arrive to this conclusion. Madara was used as a pawn and in turn Obito was used as a pawn, to a scheme that was made thousands of years ago by Kaguya/ Kaguya\u2019s will (black zetzu). As far as power creep, both Naruto and Sasuke got upgraded by Hagaromo HIMSELF. The ONLY reason he came out was cause of the power of six paths Madara obtained from the 10tails. He used that as an opportunity to give his sons reincarnations the power to stop Kaguya. He straight up gave them SSG form cause they are \u201chis sons\u201d. Pretty crazy story from an arc that\u2019s just craziness after craziness. But hey if trans dude can rebirth himself out of a snake to escape harm, I guess anything is possible.",

There was a manga published in the 1960s about a ninja named Sasuke who loses his clan, leaves his village, and tries to avenge his clan. ( Sanpei Shirato) \n\nThere was also a novel in 1959 where ninja could gain power based on genetic mutations, and the eyes could cast illusions. (Futaro Yamada)",

I understand why it\u2019s bullshit Kaguya appeared out of nowhere, but on a second re watch it all starts to make sense. Even though Madara and Obito did seriously believe that they were doing things for the sake of humanity, it made no sense how warped their view was, how they could be okay with everyone locked up so Madara could be the new god. Sounds too good to be true and pretty crazy to arrive there just by taking the eyes of your brother. It makes sense Madara has been influenced by black zetzu to arrive to this conclusion. Madara was used as a pawn and in turn Obito was used as a pawn, to a scheme that was made thousands of years ago by Kaguya/ Kaguya\u2019s will (black zetzu). As far as power creep, both Naruto and Sasuke got upgraded by Hagaromo HIMSELF. The ONLY reason he came out was cause of the power of six paths Madara obtained from the 10tails. He used that as an opportunity to give his sons reincarnations the power to stop Kaguya. He straight up gave them SSG form cause they are \u201chis sons\u201d. Pretty crazy story from an arc that\u2019s just craziness after craziness. But hey if trans dude can rebirth himself out of a snake to escape harm, I guess anything is possible.",

There was a manga published in the 1960s about a ninja named Sasuke who loses his clan, leaves his village, and tries to avenge his clan. ( Sanpei Shirato) \n\nThere was also a novel in 1959 where ninja could gain power based on genetic mutations, and the eyes could cast illusions. (Futaro Yamada)",

I understand why it\u2019s bullshit Kaguya appeared out of nowhere, but on a second re watch it all starts to make sense. Even though Madara and Obito did seriously believe that they were doing things for the sake of humanity, it made no sense how warped their view was, how they could be okay with everyone locked up so Madara could be the new god. Sounds too good to be true and pretty crazy to arrive there just by taking the eyes of your brother. It makes sense Madara has been influenced by black zetzu to arrive to this conclusion. Madara was used as a pawn and in turn Obito was used as a pawn, to a scheme that was made thousands of years ago by Kaguya/ Kaguya\u2019s will (black zetzu). As far as power creep, both Naruto and Sasuke got upgraded by Hagaromo HIMSELF. The ONLY reason he came out was cause of the power of six paths Madara obtained from the 10tails. He used that as an opportunity to give his sons reincarnations the power to stop Kaguya. He straight up gave them SSG form cause they are \u201chis sons\u201d. Pretty crazy story from an arc that\u2019s just craziness after craziness. But hey if trans dude can rebirth himself out of a snake to escape harm, I guess anything is possible.",
