I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

Since childhood he believed his older brother slaughtered his family so I\u2019m not really seeing where he behaved like an asshole. He behaved accordingly with the information he had, plus the trauma of those events actually occurring. This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen. He had many other options available to him but he chose to make Naruto\u2019s life as miserable as possible, Root, and putting up the least amount of effort possible to prevent the Uchiha massacre. Keep in mind he\u2019s \u201cgod of shinobi\u201d\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is all a story and we\u2019re only able to have this discussion bc of kishimotos brilliant writing.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Prime example of someone he would have killed would be Sazanka from the previous episode of Boruto.\n\nThat or get shinobi, bandits, samurai, etc causing carnage to serve him instead but if such people refused to serve him, he'd kill them.\n\nSasuke called Itachi the true Hokage but Itachi never adopted the title. If he had, people would still assume he was crazy but he literally couldn't call himself Hokage while wearing the leaf handband crossed out. So I don't think Sasuke was going to do that either.\n\nWhen he said he was going to become Hokage to everyone they assumed he meant the normal way it's used, if he'd instead said something like become Morakage as in Kekkei Mora everyone would think he meant conquer the world but he didn't mean that either.\n\nI don't understand why you have a problem with his character for that though. What plan would you have him come up with instead, because simply going back to village would have been anticlimatic?",

If Sasuke was older, and orochimaru wasn't apart of it, I'd imagine I'd be less of a big deal but they'd still try and stop him at first.\n\nAlso Sasuke leaving the village endangers Naruto as well, which the 3rd hokage and the ANBU/Jonin were trying to protect. Then Tsunade becoming hokage also enforced the need to protect Naruto as she saw what he has the potential to do, and the lengths he'd go to bring back Sasuke. \n\nStill don't like Sasuke. I mean I acknowledge his back story and tragic story but I just don't like his vibe and how he's handled. I don't really like \"cool emos\". Same problem with itachi",

He had no intention of actually helping him defeat Itachi, he was just juicing him to to be a body that he could steal. Those years of training were nothing but a race between the two, could Sasuke become strong enough to fight him off before he was ready to take his body.\n\nKakashi has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher. He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came.

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

The massacre of his entire family, the repeated rewatching of it through Itachi's genjutsu, the realization that Itachi was a victim and the village leaders are the one's behind everything and basically don't even give a shit, and the from that stemming realization that the shinobi world as it is is cursed and needs to be changed. It only makes sense that that would be under his guidance, as he is one of the few who have seen the thruth. \n\nThat is a completely logical way to think, especially considering he's a traumatized teen.",

He wasnt ordered to go and join Orochimaru and kill him. He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so. Also, when Naruto told him about Neji, Lee, Choji put their lives on life for him, he told Naruto he doesnt give a shit about them. If thats not betraying your village and your villagers then I don't know what is.",

But orochumaru really just wanted the vessel. Also I'm pretty sure they were in the middle of their \"we need to get rid of the Akatsuki\" plan when they said okay let's send Shikamaru to kill kakazu and hidan.

It could be argued that it was for the greater good considering the coup d'etat, but a spade's a spade, and genocide is genocide. Itachi did it out of love for his brother, selflessness, and even dragged his own name through the dirt.\n\nNagato- Died for his crimes, acted in the name of peace through deterrence, undid his most heinous crime.\n\nSasuke- After Naruto and maybe Kakashi/Jiraiya/Itachi, easily the most popular character, would have killed his sensei, his best friend, and his future wife who showed unconditional love. Acted through selfish intent and vengeance alone. I don't mind that he found redemption, since Gaara did too. His actions towards those who loved him and intent are just significantly worse than everyone else's outside of maybe Gaara, but Gaara loved his siblings through and through for what it's worth.",

But it shows what trauma can do to a person, he would have sinked further if Might Guy did not exist or intervene \n\nGaara could kill because he is psychologically damaged? Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo. And if you could argue if doing bad things for the greater good is justified in ANY CASE,then there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with Sasuke trying to enact his \u201cpeace plan\u201d after defeating Kaguya (even though it was obviously problematic). \n\n Nagato-He only undid what he did to the Leaf in that battle. There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

                            "body": "To be fair to Kakashi he was trying to save his student's life. I'm quite sure we all supported Sasuke killing Itachi originally as a fandom. But in universe - Itachi graduated in a year and was a captain in Konoha's Black Ops squad by the time he was Sasuke's age. As far as Kakashi is concerned if Sasuke doesn't turn away from his path he is going to die. Itachi will take him apart and put him back together and then take him apart again.\n\nIt's funny that you're accusing others of cherry picking canon while you're doing the same. In that particular moment in the story Kakashi was very much in the right. Sasuke, at the time, simply hadn't shown the aptitude Itachi had at the same age.\n\nKeep in mind that Kakashi knew exactly what was required of someone in Konoha's ANBU. So yeah, at that point in time in canon we saw an experienced ninja, one of Konoha's best, telling his student that if he kept on his path to try and kill Itachi he was going to die. Sasuke was a talented kid, but he hadn't given off any indication that he possessed the ability to surpass Itachi. Could Kakashi have worded it better? Absolutely, but no one has ever accused Kakashi of being mentally well adjusted.\n\nIt's a harsh truth but at that point in time, with all that Kakashi knew and all that the readers knew, Itachi was beyond the reach of everyone in canon not including the dead Hokage. Orochimaru, the biggest villain at the time, admitted to being weaker than Itachi. At least I think it was in part 1? I could be wrong been a long time since I read the manga. Can't remember if it was in part 1 or two that Orochimaru admits that.\n\nI don't think Sasuke was a cunt or anything in part 1, he was very much a traumatized kid at the time and the thought of revenge kept him going. But saying that Kakashi wasn't supportive of him is just factually incorrect. Unless assisting a 13 year old in committing suicide by mass murdering elder brother is your idea of being supportive?",

You're either speed reading or skipping over my comment completely.\n\n**You're missing the point.** The point I made was that *Kakashi was being supportive of Sasuke as best he could*. He, as Sasuke's team leader and teacher, was telling his student that if Sasuke did not stop going after revenge, he was going to die. This is a harsh truth that no one had sat down and spoken to Sasuke about before. **Of course it didn't work but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.**\n\n*You said the following -*\n\nKakashi straight up told Sasuke to... How exactly is that being on his side?\"\n\n*My main point is:* **This is incorrect. Kakashi was very much on Sasuke's side.** As I explained in my comment above.\n\nNow to go on a tangent about the other things you mentioned:\n\nKakashi does the best he can with what he is given. Saying that he wasn't supportive of his student is incorrect. *I never once said that Sasuke received any emotional help in the village*. *His lack of a proper support structure* is what allowed Orochimaru to get his fangs into Sasuke in the first place.\n\nIt's almost like a fictional ninja village training kids to become soldiers for the sake of the state is not the best place to go looking for emotional support structures especially by modern standards.\n\n**That's sort of the whole tragedy of Sasuke's story.** It wasn't that people went out of their way to ignore him, but that the structure of the society they grew up in was not designed to create happy, well adjusted people. **How to change this society and make it better was the main source of conflict between Naruto and Sasuke in part 2. And was the underlying conflict in Naruto.**\n\nAs they grow up and become adults, both Naruto and Sasuke realize that they world they live in needs to change. They arrive at two different conclusions based off their personal experiences. Kishimoto gives us multiple different viewpoints on this topic. That's the underlying lesson/ message/ conflict in Naruto.",

That's exactly what Itachi taught Sasuke to do in the original series. He told him to kill his friend for the MS. \n\nIf not for that, Sasuke would stay in the Hidden Leaf with Naruto and Sakura.

He was told many years that his brother was evil a traitor and mind raped repeatedly. \n\nHe suddenly kills him and told everything he lived for is a lie. What do you think would any mentally unstable tortured teen feel when their whole world turns upside down. They become really unstable. He just wanted to inflict pain on the leaf.\n\nBut he calmed down soon enough and basically did nothing except empty threats. After talking to the hokages and Itachi again instead of just empty pain he wanted a revolution.\n\nMaybe morally questionable killing the kages and tailed beast? But can you blame him. The system was cruel rotten to the core and no one wanted to change anything apart from people putting everyone in a massive fake world. Naruto too was all just blind talk that trust in me i will change everything without any iota of idea.\n\nSasuke is definitely smarter than Itachi. Itachi had blind patriotism, Sasuke did not. He understood why village was made but also understood to not be blindly patriotic to a point where you kill your family torture your younger brother. \n\nEven at the end he goes on a voluntary exile to see smallfolk. Like the Sasuke Shinden story where he busts a slave ring which ninja villages conveniently ignore.",

Choji and Neji even almost died.\n\n> Even if you say earlier with Orochimaru that Sasuke was purposefully not killing innocents, that definitely changes later. Karin said it multiple times, that he was growing darker.\n\nYes, that's the point. He withstood multiple challenges without breaking to kill Itachi. And once he did, Obito did the emotional equivalent to him of Bane breaking Bruce's back over his knee.\n\nSo I don't understand what your point is.\n\nAnd both times Sasuke tried to kill Sakura, she was trying to first.\n\nAnd Sasuke dealt with it head on as well. Doesn't get anymore head on that than seeking justice for those killed.\n\nOn the other hand I'd say letting Sarada grow up alone is not dealing it with it head on anymore. He's usually emotionally blank now which is to be expected.\n\nI'm not saying what Sasuke did was good. I'm saying it was par for the course in shinobi world. And the reason Naruto \"dealt with it head on\" the way you mean it is because he actually had Iruka care for him while he was young.\n\nThey let Sasuke grow up alone in the empty Uchiha residential area.\n\nHashirama said his goal for creating the village was not only to stop wars but to supersede clans.

Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

While Sasuke sulked Naruto built a family. Your backstory can only carry you so far at certain point it's time you be held accountable. Naruto had just as much reason as any to turn villain but he didn't. People wanting to ignore all his bad simply because his family was murdered and his brother was not the best don't make sense. Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for. He could have gone next level if he stayed he was simply impatient. All in all you can understand why someone does what they did but still call out their bad behavior as such",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

People say itachi didn't want to do anything wrong and danzo forced him but I don't remember danzo telling him to mindrape sasuke who was only 7-8 years old. Itachi even told him to kill his best friend to get the mangekyo sharingan. In Naruto part 1, he does start to open up to team 7 in chunnin exams and the wave arc but all people say is that he always would have betrayed them. He was mindraped AGAIN at the end of part 1 by itachi who told him that he lacks hatred and is weak. Do people not get that he didn't saw any future of killing itachi by remaining in konoha. How would he have even gotten strong enough? The strongest in konoha at that time were jiraiya, tsunade and kakashi. Tsunade was hokage, jiraiya was going to train naruto. Do you think he would have wanted to train with kakashi? Who was defeated by itachi and was scared of orochimaru, the same orochimaru who was stronger than the third hokage and said to be inferior to itachi. He also had the curse mark influencing his thoughts so he decided to go for the best option, orochimaru. I don't agree with what he did after itachi died but not gonna go in detail for that.",

However he was manipulated by his family and village. He was given the task of stopping his family's coup by murdering them and he knew if he didn't they'd just find someone else to take care of things. This at least gave him some measure of control over the situation but he'd still be carrying the weight of what he did with him forever. If I'm not mistaken he knew about Obito and what was to come and wanted Sasuke to be strong. Why he thought the only way to do so was to stroke Sasuke's already massive revenge boner idk like I said he wasn't a good brother or as good a person as made out to be although he at least seemed to try to limit the Akatsukis body count although I could be wrong it's been awhile. Basically this is a long winded way of saying if we're willing to justify what Sasuke did it's not far fetched to also give itachi some slack.",

They were forcing him to come back to place which was haunting for him and he chose the best way to silence Naruto which was to knock him out. \n\nHis first murder was Orochimaru ffs. The big terrorist who konoha conveniently ignored as all his old bffs were in leadership. He destroyed the sound bases and every corrupted soul by orochimaru there. He helped Konoha more than most.\n\nEven team taka/hebi intially was a no kill rule for anyone except Itachi. He let people live as long they let them be. How could he not make revenge not core of his life?? Itachi the fool with his blind devotion for the village did not want Sasuke to get suspicious about people like Danzo and directed all the hatred on him. He mind raped Sasuke twice and wanted Sasuke to kill him as he was feeling emotionally done with life because of his actions.",

See, Naruto WAS seeking revenge on some level and it was, in no way, wrong. \n\nYou WANT to act out against injustice done to you, if you don't, you are basically lacking braincells. What I meant by this post, that many people seem to not be getting because apparently everything has to be straightforward for them, is that Sasuke is not wrong in his revenge quest, he is wrong in trying to kill Konoha people, but not the general revenge plan for his clan.",

You can't really compare an apple to an orange. I'm sure Naruto would have loved to beat pain to a pulp had it not been for the character growth he had and the fact if who is. Meanwhile I don't think there was ever a scenario where Sasuke would have sat down and talked with itachi even if itachi hadn't provoked him down the path of killing him.",

Sasuke still had reasons for what he did and people saying \"he betrayed his friends\" are genuinely ignorant. I can't imagine myself if my older brother killed everyone I love or the pain of reliving it again with genjutsu. I love seeing his growth and even at the end he talks/acts way different than he did as a kid. Hes not as energetic and clearly still deals with trauma. People have completely missed his point as a character",

Of course revenge was a motive as well but not all of it.\n\n\nWas Naruto willingly doing that or was he blinded by shock, pain and the Kyuubis hatred? I mean yeah it wasn't a smart thing to try but he wasn't in his right state of mind and it was just a moment of weakness.\n\n\nDon't have anything to say about that... I always thought Pain was kinda being petty- lol (Thats my opinion and I accept other opinions)\n\n\nYou know, I'm a bit biased myself so maybe what I'm saying is kind of hypercritical... But you're a bit too biased. You focused on completely different aspects when you summarized Sasuke's story.",

When it comed to Sasuke, you have to think about it like this. Sasuke's revenge although was relative, no, even more justified than someone like Shikamaru, was being entangled by Orochimaru. That in itself, was really detrimental to Konoha at the time, even if Sasuke himself didn't wish for it. Of course, Orochimaru didn't get Sasuke's body in the end. However, everyone from Konoha never once really tried to stop Sasuke directly from killing Itachi. They just wanted him back in Konoha in the right state of mind (something Naruto and Shikamaru had that Sasuke didn't). Sasuke's revenge was quite literally twisting his personality completely and he chased it for all his life, a big reason as to why Kakashi warned him of it. Sasuke literally spent years of his life just trying to kill Itachi. Lastly, the majority of Konoha only decided to kill Sasuke off when he himself, directly, tried to launch an assult on Konoha and even allied himself with their biggest foes at the time. There is SO much more context behind Sasuke's revenge and why in the end, someone like Kakashi rallied himself against it. TL:DR, unlike Shikamaru and Naruto, Sasuke's revenge was killing him and took the majority of his childhood, and teenagehood to accomplish that. One might argue that if he got help from the start, it'd be different, but he kept that part of his life soley to himself and locked it away from everyone else.",

            "body": "(Disclaimer: my memory of events may not be perfect. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I sadly haven't rewatched much of the Sasuke-relevant episodes in a while because I just don't like him as much as the other characters)\n\nTL;DR: Sasuke's emotions and desires were understandable and should have been treated with more sympathy but that doesn't change the fact that the way he wanted to fulfill them shouldn't be condoned or supported.\n\nWanting Itachi dead for his crimes? Perfectly understandable. I agree that Sasuke during Part 1 should be viewed a lot more sympathetically and compassionately. \n\nHowever, that does not mean I believe what he did in pursuit of his goal and the goal itself should have been condoned. Sasuke wanted to kill Itachi at all costs regardless of what consequences it has on him (rushing into battle against Itachi at the hotel) and on those around him (stating that he would eliminate all those that get in his way). That makes him a hazard. That kind of behavior shouldn't be condoned. \n\nIt's for this reason that I also think Naruto's and Shikamaru's cases differ from Sasuke's. All 3 wanted to avenge a loved one (or in Sasuke's case, every single loved one he had) by defeating and killing their murderers themselves. The double standard argument holds if we leave it there. However, the cases are different due to a number of factors which affects how one should reasonably support their actions. First, power level. Naruto and Shikamaru were at minimum chunin level when Jiraiya and Asuma died. Sasuke was still in the academy when he started planning murder. No one batted an eye when Naruto and Shikamaru set out to defeat Pain and Hidan because they were capable of putting up a fight. Sasuke, on the other hand, was reckless to the point of charging Itachi with a mere chidori and without a plan. Second, the actual reason for killing the bad guy. Shikamaru did it to finish the mission and to make the world a safer place for the next generation (recall the King talk Asuma gave Shikamaru). Naruto fought Pain not just to avenge Jiraiya but also to protect the village and later, to prove Pain's faulty logic wrong. Heck, I argue that the conclusion of that fight (Naruto choosing to talk to Nagato instead of killing him outright) is a sign of him overcoming his revenge urges. As stated previously, Sasuke's goals were purely to kill Itachi. From what I can remember, never has it been stated that Sasuke has any plans for after killing Itachi nor is it for some other purpose beyond himself and the Uchiha. Some would argue his goals were to restore the honor of his clan. However, I do not think his actions reflect that; he, the only Uchiha left, threw his life around and became a criminal thus tarnishing the reputation of the Uchiha even further. If he had those intentions at first, he certainly lost sight of them later on. There's probably more but this comment is getting too long anyway. \n\nThat being said, the way Kakashi and the other adults tried to talk Sasuke out of it was...pretty bad. I mean they were gaslighting him and just telling him to drop it. That is not how one should talk to a traumatized preteen to get him to not do something rash and drastic. One should've approached him with compassion and understanding and worked to help him realize that he has a life beyond the Uchiha massacre. Sasuke betraying everyone was as much their fault as it was Sasuke's and Orochimaru's. \n\nIn the end, Sasuke was a rightfully vindictive preteen with a reckless mentality that was pushed to extremes by superiors that alienated him and exploited by parties with not so moral intentions. He was as much a victim of society as Naruto was but unlike Naruto, chose the more destructive route that ultimately achieves nothing (as the narrative of the show argues). That's where my opinion lies regarding Sasuke.",

Anyway I always thought that Kakashi had partiality for Sasuke. He won't be able to reach high skill level as he did with Orochimaru but eventually they'll become somewhat strong. That's when Hidden Leaf will allow then to go after Itachi. They'll fight Itachi. Though they can't defeat Itachi, Itachi will realise that Sasuke is with the right people and that he'll eventually become stronger. He will continue his plan to die during this fight. Sasuke will get his revenge and now what? Maybe Tobi will capture/kidnap Sasuke (with kamui) after this fight. And tell him the truth about Itachi, he may get MS but he will realise of Itachi did that and sacrificed himself protecting Sasuke, he should fulfill his wish of protecting Hidden Leaf. (Don't ask me how he'll escape from Tobi) This is like the utopia of the story where Sasuke is the most genius, understanding and mature character. Plus if he told that to Tsunade and she confirms it by asking any other elder, she would give Sasuke the last Uchiha more preference for becoming Hokage and it will be a battle between Naruto and Sasuke to know who will be the Hokage first.\n\nFor people saying they allowed Shikamaru to take revenge but not Sasuke. First of all Sasuke was like 12 at that time and we know how weak he was. If he went for a round 2 he couldn't have survived. (Since no one knew Itachi won't will Sasuke) Shikamaru was older and experienced. He had fought them already and knows their abilities. And it wasn't just Shikamaru, it was Ino-Shika-Cho. They were supposed to have a strategy. Plus Kakashi went with them. So they were safer.",

My comment isn't concerned with that, its getting the point across of how Sasuke\u2019s thought process works and how his desire for revenge is valid. I will say that killing an entire village is over kill but killing high ranking shinobi who were aware of or took part in the massacre is valid.",

Unless you've conveniently forgotten the Senju and Uchiha were always bitter rivals. You say Sasuke hating sand wanting to destroy the leaf is justifiable because off the deaths off hiss clan, by that same stance the 2nd hating and placing restrictions on the Uchiha is justifiable as well. But completely ignoring all that, the reason they could not own property, or hold positions of power outside the peacekeeping Corps is because they could literally brainwash people. It's just pragmatic. The entire world of Naruto has huge asymmetry, if you allowed the Uchiha all the same rights as the regular run of thee mill villagers, they could easily mindrape them into giving away their property and livelihood. They would be an oppressed minority if they weren't literally genetically superior Aryan Ubermensch Ninjas. With the way the inheritance of the Mangekyo works, literally 1 in 2 Uchiha could acquire it at minimum, more if they were taught to encouraged to make friends outside the clan, and then manipulated into fighting and cutting ties with them. They had restrictions because they were legitimately dangerous, but no one treated them like shit like Naruto was treated. They were a revered, respected and up until they shit the bed and decided to fuck themselves over, an honorable and loyal clan. I'll concede that it's all technically Madaras fault, but they still made shit decisions, to the point that even their own family member decided they needed to be put down.",

Because a lot of the supporting cast lack agency as characters, Sasuke also has to? Not at all, he was a character who was given so much attention and care by kishi for y'all to  do him dirty. Perhaps joining orochimaru of all people isn't morally correct, but it is the most logical option. Kakashi straight up told Sasuke to \"let go of revenge\" or some dumb shit like that without even considering supporting him, Kakashi had good intentions but I feel he failed Sasuke in this moment. Team 7 and the rest of Konoha were never going to really accept sasuke's wishes so he took matters into his own hands. If he had been supported, it wouldn't have happened. He would've stayed. The entire argument being \"he left the village, he joined orochimaru\" is demolished with these words. This isn't sasuke's fault at all, he was seeking support to reach his goal and he didn't get it, logically, he left. As for the whole \"he killed innocent samurai, he tried killing team 7 and Karin\", sasuke was very clearly not in a sane state of mind, when he initially formed the taka, he mentioned a no kill policy, he didn't want to kill innocents and he didn't. Five kage summit Sasuke is very much a mentally ill teen who needs serious help, and the lack of help (being manipulated by tobi instead), made things much worse when he found out the truth. Sasuke didn't act in a sane state, does it erase what he did? Of course not, but people refuse to attempt sympathizing with his character. Trying to kill danzo while stabbing through Karin was definitely wrong, for someone of sasuke's moral standards, killing the innocent samurai was also wrong, for the entire shinobi world? That's normal. People drop like flies in that world. As for team 7, Sakura attempted to kill him so it makes sense that he attempts the same. Kakashi is in sasuke's mind, an obstacle, he tried to stop him once,it didn't work but he can't spare time for a repeat scenario. Naruto, actually tries talking to Sasuke but it doesn't really work so they clash for a bit and that's it. Naruto is similar to Kakashi in a sense that he's an obstacle yet there is a distinct difference, Naruto is his closest friend and comes to understand him more and more every time they clash, such feelings are the obstacle, and naruto is the cause.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

Since childhood he believed his older brother slaughtered his family so I\u2019m not really seeing where he behaved like an asshole. He behaved accordingly with the information he had, plus the trauma of those events actually occurring. This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen. He had many other options available to him but he chose to make Naruto\u2019s life as miserable as possible, Root, and putting up the least amount of effort possible to prevent the Uchiha massacre.

You're asking a lot from children here. No adult supported Naruto until Iruka and he was supportive of all his students. Hinata was supportive of Naruto but was to shy to do anything about it in a meaningful way. They later kinda retcon that shikamaru and choji are nice to him but eh. I already said it but it applies here. Help and support was available to him he just refused to accept it. Kakashi eventually got through to him a bit simply due to the fact he had the raw power saskue thought he needed",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Prime example of someone he would have killed would be Sazanka from the previous episode of Boruto.\n\nThat or get shinobi, bandits, samurai, etc causing carnage to serve him instead but if such people refused to serve him, he'd kill them.\n\nSasuke called Itachi the true Hokage but Itachi never adopted the title. If he had, people would still assume he was crazy but he literally couldn't call himself Hokage while wearing the leaf handband crossed out. So I don't think Sasuke was going to do that either.\n\nWhen he said he was going to become Hokage to everyone they assumed he meant the normal way it's used, if he'd instead said something like become Morakage as in Kekkei Mora everyone would think he meant conquer the world but he didn't mean that either.\n\nI don't understand why you have a problem with his character for that though. What plan would you have him come up with instead, because simply going back to village would have been anticlimatic?",

If Sasuke was older, and orochimaru wasn't apart of it, I'd imagine I'd be less of a big deal but they'd still try and stop him at first.\n\nAlso Sasuke leaving the village endangers Naruto as well, which the 3rd hokage and the ANBU/Jonin were trying to protect. Then Tsunade becoming hokage also enforced the need to protect Naruto as she saw what he has the potential to do, and the lengths he'd go to bring back Sasuke. \n\nStill don't like Sasuke. I mean I acknowledge his back story and tragic story but I just don't like his vibe and how he's handled. I don't really like \"cool emos\". Same problem with itachi",

Those years of training were nothing but a race between the two, could Sasuke become strong enough to fight him off before he was ready to take his body.\n\nKakashi has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher. He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came.

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

Nagato asked him for a solution for peace but he actually didn't give one. He basically said Jiraiya's hope for the world explained through his book is what he was going to strive for no matter how much he suffered but Nagato had obviously read the book as well.\n\nWhatever Sasuke would say to him would carry much more weight because he has the same feelings as him but much stronger than Naruto's and directed towards Konoha too and because Nagato worked with Itachi for a long time.\n\nSasuke should have shown up just in time to catch Yahiko's arm as he was about to run Hinata through causing Naruto to transform.

After fighting Itachi, Taka rescues him and they lay low for a while. With Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu and Itachi dead, the Akatsuki says they need the fox ASAP and decide to attack Konoha.

The massacre of his entire family, the repeated rewatching of it through Itachi's genjutsu, the realization that Itachi was a victim and the village leaders are the one's behind everything and basically don't even give a shit, and the from that stemming realization that the shinobi world as it is is cursed and needs to be changed. It only makes sense that that would be under his guidance, as he is one of the few who have seen the thruth. \n\nThat is a completely logical way to think, especially considering he's a traumatized teen.",

He wasnt ordered to go and join Orochimaru and kill him. He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so. Also, when Naruto told him about Neji, Lee, Choji put their lives on life for him, he told Naruto he doesnt give a shit about them.

It could be argued that it was for the greater good considering the coup d'etat, but a spade's a spade, and genocide is genocide. Itachi did it out of love for his brother, selflessness, and even dragged his own name through the dirt.\n\nNagato- Died for his crimes, acted in the name of peace through deterrence, undid his most heinous crime.\n\nSasuke- After Naruto and maybe Kakashi/Jiraiya/Itachi, easily the most popular character, would have killed his sensei, his best friend, and his future wife who showed unconditional love. Acted through selfish intent and vengeance alone. I don't mind that he found redemption, since Gaara did too. His actions towards those who loved him and intent are just significantly worse than everyone else's outside of maybe Gaara, but Gaara loved his siblings through and through for what it's worth.",

But it shows what trauma can do to a person, he would have sinked further if Might Guy did not exist or intervene \n\nGaara could kill because he is psychologically damaged? Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo. And if you could argue if doing bad things for the greater good is justified in ANY CASE,then there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with Sasuke trying to enact his \u201cpeace plan\u201d after defeating Kaguya (even though it was obviously problematic). \n\n Nagato-He only undid what he did to the Leaf in that battle. There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

                    "body": "To be fair to Kakashi he was trying to save his student's life. I'm quite sure we all supported Sasuke killing Itachi originally as a fandom. But in universe - Itachi graduated in a year and was a captain in Konoha's Black Ops squad by the time he was Sasuke's age. As far as Kakashi is concerned if Sasuke doesn't turn away from his path he is going to die. Itachi will take him apart and put him back together and then take him apart again.\n\nIt's funny that you're accusing others of cherry picking canon while you're doing the same. In that particular moment in the story Kakashi was very much in the right. Sasuke, at the time, simply hadn't shown the aptitude Itachi had at the same age.\n\nKeep in mind that Kakashi knew exactly what was required of someone in Konoha's ANBU. So yeah, at that point in time in canon we saw an experienced ninja, one of Konoha's best, telling his student that if he kept on his path to try and kill Itachi he was going to die. Sasuke was a talented kid, but he hadn't given off any indication that he possessed the ability to surpass Itachi. Could Kakashi have worded it better? Absolutely, but no one has ever accused Kakashi of being mentally well adjusted.\n\nIt's a harsh truth but at that point in time, with all that Kakashi knew and all that the readers knew, Itachi was beyond the reach of everyone in canon not including the dead Hokage. Orochimaru, the biggest villain at the time, admitted to being weaker than Itachi. At least I think it was in part 1? I could be wrong been a long time since I read the manga. Can't remember if it was in part 1 or two that Orochimaru admits that.\n\nI don't think Sasuke was a cunt or anything in part 1, he was very much a traumatized kid at the time and the thought of revenge kept him going. But saying that Kakashi wasn't supportive of him is just factually incorrect. Unless assisting a 13 year old in committing suicide by mass murdering elder brother is your idea of being supportive?",

You're either speed reading or skipping over my comment completely.\n\n**You're missing the point.** The point I made was that *Kakashi was being supportive of Sasuke as best he could*. He, as Sasuke's team leader and teacher, was telling his student that if Sasuke did not stop going after revenge, he was going to die. This is a harsh truth that no one had sat down and spoken to Sasuke about before. **Of course it didn't work but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.**\n\n*You said the following -*\n\nKakashi straight up told Sasuke to... How exactly is that being on his side?\"\n\n*My main point is:* **This is incorrect. Kakashi was very much on Sasuke's side.** As I explained in my comment above.\n\nNow to go on a tangent about the other things you mentioned:\n\nKakashi does the best he can with what he is given. Saying that he wasn't supportive of his student is incorrect. *I never once said that Sasuke received any emotional help in the village*. *His lack of a proper support structure* is what allowed Orochimaru to get his fangs into Sasuke in the first place.\n\nIt's almost like a fictional ninja village training kids to become soldiers for the sake of the state is not the best place to go looking for emotional support structures especially by modern standards.\n\n**That's sort of the whole tragedy of Sasuke's story.** It wasn't that people went out of their way to ignore him, but that the structure of the society they grew up in was not designed to create happy, well adjusted people. **How to change this society and make it better was the main source of conflict between Naruto and Sasuke in part 2. And was the underlying conflict in Naruto.**\n\nAs they grow up and become adults, both Naruto and Sasuke realize that they world they live in needs to change. They arrive at two different conclusions based off their personal experiences. Kishimoto gives us multiple different viewpoints on this topic. That's the underlying lesson/ message/ conflict in Naruto.",

What do you think would any mentally unstable tortured teen feel when their whole world turns upside down. They become really unstable. He just wanted to inflict pain on the leaf.\n\nBut he calmed down soon enough and basically did nothing except empty threats. After talking to the hokages and Itachi again instead of just empty pain he wanted a revolution.\n\nMaybe morally questionable killing the kages and tailed beast? But can you blame him. The system was cruel rotten to the core and no one wanted to change anything apart from people putting everyone in a massive fake world. Naruto too was all just blind talk that trust in me i will change everything without any iota of idea.\n\nSasuke is definitely smarter than Itachi. Itachi had blind patriotism, Sasuke did not. He understood why village was made but also understood to not be blindly patriotic to a point where you kill your family torture your younger brother. \n\nEven at the end he goes on a voluntary exile to see smallfolk. Like the Sasuke Shinden story where he busts a slave ring which ninja villages conveniently ignore.",

Choji and Neji even almost died.\n\n> Even if you say earlier with Orochimaru that Sasuke was purposefully not killing innocents, that definitely changes later. Karin said it multiple times, that he was growing darker.\n\nYes, that's the point. He withstood multiple challenges without breaking to kill Itachi. And once he did, Obito did the emotional equivalent to him of Bane breaking Bruce's back over his knee.\n\nSo I don't understand what your point is.\n\nAnd both times Sasuke tried to kill Sakura, she was trying to first.\n\nAnd Sasuke dealt with it head on as well. Doesn't get anymore head on that than seeking justice for those killed.\n\nOn the other hand I'd say letting Sarada grow up alone is not dealing it with it head on anymore. He's usually emotionally blank now which is to be expected.\n\nI'm not saying what Sasuke did was good. I'm saying it was par for the course in shinobi world. And the reason Naruto \"dealt with it head on\" the way you mean it is because he actually had Iruka care for him while he was young.\n\nThey let Sasuke grow up alone in the empty Uchiha residential area.\n\nHashirama said his goal for creating the village was not only to stop wars but to supersede clans. But no one even adopted Sasuke despite having nothing against him unlike Naruto.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

People wanting to ignore all his bad simply because his family was murdered and his brother was not the best don't make sense. Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for. He could have gone next level if he stayed he was simply impatient. All in all you can understand why someone does what they did but still call out their bad behavior as such",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

However he was manipulated by his family and village. He was given the task of stopping his family's coup by murdering them and he knew if he didn't they'd just find someone else to take care of things. This at least gave him some measure of control over the situation but he'd still be carrying the weight of what he did with him forever. If I'm not mistaken he knew about Obito and what was to come and wanted Sasuke to be strong. Why he thought the only way to do so was to stroke Sasuke's already massive revenge boner idk like I said he wasn't a good brother or as good a person as made out to be although he at least seemed to try to limit the Akatsukis body count although I could be wrong it's been awhile. Basically this is a long winded way of saying if we're willing to justify what Sasuke did it's not far fetched to also give itachi some slack.",

The big terrorist who konoha conveniently ignored as all his old bffs were in leadership. He destroyed the sound bases and every corrupted soul by orochimaru there. He helped Konoha more than most.\n\nEven team taka/hebi intially was a no kill rule for anyone except Itachi. He let people live as long they let them be. How could he not make revenge not core of his life?? Itachi the fool with his blind devotion for the village did not want Sasuke to get suspicious about people like Danzo and directed all the hatred on him. He mind raped Sasuke twice and wanted Sasuke to kill him as he was feeling emotionally done with life because of his actions.",

It's a canon fact that the villages used taxes and turned it into war funds to obliterate all the smaller nations for profit, they have still not recovered even in the Boruto era. And it's also a fact they used akatsuki and paid them, and the fact Konoha was responsible for all 3 wars just to gain resources. How is vengeance against a fascist imperialistic village something that shouldn't be supported? Stop looking at things from a Western perspective. Lol no one cares if a shit village calls someone a bad guy for plotting their destruction, cause they're the ultimate bad guys themselves ava",

I mean yeah it wasn't a smart thing to try but he wasn't in his right state of mind and it was just a moment of weakness.\n\n\nDon't have anything to say about that... I always thought Pain was kinda being petty- lol (Thats my opinion and I accept other opinions)\n\n\nYou know, I'm a bit biased myself so maybe what I'm saying is kind of hypercritical...

In the second part your just proving my point, he wanted revenge and he got it. His reasons for getting revenge are different which is why comparing him to the others is illogical. My comment isn't concerned with that, its getting the point across of how Sasuke\u2019s thought process works and how his desire for revenge is valid. I will say that killing an entire village is over kill but killing high ranking shinobi who were aware of or took part in the massacre is valid.",

And justifiably so. It is a tragedy, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't mean the Uchiha were the innocent angels everyone seems to think they are.\n\nThey killed the children and babies and civilians. Not everyone in the Uchiha Clan was in the know\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Uchihas were also an oppressed minority so it's actually justifiable to fight for your rights.",

Unless you've conveniently forgotten the Senju and Uchiha were always bitter rivals. You say Sasuke hating sand wanting to destroy the leaf is justifiable because off the deaths off hiss clan, by that same stance the 2nd hating and placing restrictions on the Uchiha is justifiable as well. But completely ignoring all that, the reason they could not own property, or hold positions of power outside the peacekeeping Corps is because they could literally brainwash people. It's just pragmatic. The entire world of Naruto has huge asymmetry, if you allowed the Uchiha all the same rights as the regular run of thee mill villagers, they could easily mindrape them into giving away their property and livelihood. They would be an oppressed minority if they weren't literally genetically superior Aryan Ubermensch Ninjas. With the way the inheritance of the Mangekyo works, literally 1 in 2 Uchiha could acquire it at minimum, more if they were taught to encouraged to make friends outside the clan, and then manipulated into fighting and cutting ties with them. They had restrictions because they were legitimately dangerous, but no one treated them like shit like Naruto was treated. They were a revered, respected and up until they shit the bed and decided to fuck themselves over, an honorable and loyal clan. I'll concede that it's all technically Madaras fault, but they still made shit decisions, to the point that even their own family member decided they needed to be put down.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

Since childhood he believed his older brother slaughtered his family so I\u2019m not really seeing where he behaved like an asshole. He behaved accordingly with the information he had, plus the trauma of those events actually occurring. This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen. He had many other options available to him but he chose to make Naruto\u2019s life as miserable as possible, Root, and putting up the least amount of effort possible to prevent the Uchiha massacre. Keep in mind he\u2019s \u201cgod of shinobi\u201d\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is all a story and we\u2019re only able to have this discussion bc of kishimotos brilliant writing.",

Kakashi eventually got through to him a bit simply due to the fact he had the raw power saskue thought he needed",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Prime example of someone he would have killed would be Sazanka from the previous episode of Boruto.\n\nThat or get shinobi, bandits, samurai, etc causing carnage to serve him instead but if such people refused to serve him, he'd kill them.\n\nSasuke called Itachi the true Hokage but Itachi never adopted the title. If he had, people would still assume he was crazy but he literally couldn't call himself Hokage while wearing the leaf handband crossed out. So I don't think Sasuke was going to do that either.\n\nWhen he said he was going to become Hokage to everyone they assumed he meant the normal way it's used, if he'd instead said something like become Morakage as in Kekkei Mora everyone would think he meant conquer the world but he didn't mean that either.\n\nI don't understand why you have a problem with his character for that though. What plan would you have him come up with instead, because simply going back to village would have been anticlimatic?",

If Sasuke was older, and orochimaru wasn't apart of it, I'd imagine I'd be less of a big deal but they'd still try and stop him at first.\n\nAlso Sasuke leaving the village endangers Naruto as well, which the 3rd hokage and the ANBU/Jonin were trying to protect. Then Tsunade becoming hokage also enforced the need to protect Naruto as she saw what he has the potential to do, and the lengths he'd go to bring back Sasuke. \n\nStill don't like Sasuke. I mean I acknowledge his back story and tragic story but I just don't like his vibe and how he's handled. I don't really like \"cool emos\". Same problem with itachi",

Those years of training were nothing but a race between the two, could Sasuke become strong enough to fight him off before he was ready to take his body.\n\nKakashi has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher. He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came. He wouldn't be limited to one teacher in the snake paedophile dungeon.",

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

Had he not done that Naruto and the others would have taken him back right away.\n\nIn this alternate timeline, it would be stupid for him to arrive at the village after Nagato passes away.\n\nHad Sasuke listened to what Obito said and chosen to do what Itachi wanted him to do instead of trying to capture Killer B he'd arrive at Konoha before the attack.\n\nNaruto's words to Nagato were really disappointing to me. Nagato asked him for a solution for peace but he actually didn't give one. He basically said Jiraiya's hope for the world explained through his book is what he was going to strive for no matter how much he suffered but Nagato had obviously read the book as well.\n\nWhatever Sasuke would say to him would carry much more weight because he has the same feelings as him but much stronger than Naruto's and directed towards Konoha too and because Nagato worked with Itachi for a long time.\n\nSasuke should have shown up just in time to catch Yahiko's arm as he was about to run Hinata through causing Naruto to transform. And prior he should have been reflecting in the room with the Uchiha stone tablet.",

And yes Naruto's talk no jutsu was pretty meh against Nagato.\n\nIt should have played out like this instead: \n\nSasuke's fight is way before Pain's attack just like you said. After fighting Itachi, Taka rescues him and they lay low for a while. With Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu and Itachi dead, the Akatsuki says they need the fox ASAP and decide to attack Konoha. Plays out like you said. Sasuke saves Hinata and helps Naruto kill all the Pains.\n\nFor Kakashi, it would be he uses his remaining force to kamui the nail, then collapses because he's out of chakra. Pain doesn't bother to check if he's dead, because either way he won't be a hassle.\n\nThen after all this, the Danzo stuff happens. Making even more sense to why Tobi would want Sasuke, because his most emotionally damaged pawn (Nagato) died and he needs a replacement.",

He wasnt ordered to go and join Orochimaru and kill him. He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so. Also, when Naruto told him about Neji, Lee, Choji put their lives on life for him, he told Naruto he doesnt give a shit about them.

But orochumaru really just wanted the vessel. Also I'm pretty sure they were in the middle of their \"we need to get rid of the Akatsuki\" plan when they said okay let's send Shikamaru to kill kakazu and hidan. I'm sure given enough time sauske would have definitely been a part of the crew sent to kill itachi when it came time to do so.",

He fought for his country.\n\nGaara- Weaponized by his father, demon in him preventing him from getting any sleep as to where he was driven mad, killing was explicitly allowed in the Chuunin exams.\n\nItachi- Died for his crimes. It could be argued that it was for the greater good considering the coup d'etat, but a spade's a spade, and genocide is genocide. Itachi did it out of love for his brother, selflessness, and even dragged his own name through the dirt.\n\nNagato- Died for his crimes, acted in the name of peace through deterrence, undid his most heinous crime.\n\nSasuke- After Naruto and maybe Kakashi/Jiraiya/Itachi, easily the most popular character, would have killed his sensei, his best friend, and his future wife who showed unconditional love. Acted through selfish intent and vengeance alone. I don't mind that he found redemption, since Gaara did too. His actions towards those who loved him and intent are just significantly worse than everyone else's outside of maybe Gaara, but Gaara loved his siblings through and through for what it's worth.",

But it shows what trauma can do to a person, he would have sinked further if Might Guy did not exist or intervene \n\nGaara could kill because he is psychologically damaged? Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo. And if you could argue if doing bad things for the greater good is justified in ANY CASE,then there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with Sasuke trying to enact his \u201cpeace plan\u201d after defeating Kaguya (even though it was obviously problematic). \n\n Nagato-He only undid what he did to the Leaf in that battle. There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

He goes rogue and basicly joins a S-rank criminal or whatever (orochimaru)  to kill itachi.\nNaruto wants to avenge jiraijya, but he doesn't immediately leave the village or whatever, he trains hard to learn sage mode and to get stronger, then saves the hidden leaf and talks with nagato  and then he's satisfied.\nThere's a big difference in whta these 2 did to get revenge, and after getting revenge sasuke wants to kill EVERY SINGLE PERSON from the hidden leaf while alot of them couldn't do shhit about the uchiha massacre , so it does make sense that naruto gets supported but sasuke doesn't, right?",

            "body": "To be fair to Kakashi he was trying to save his student's life. I'm quite sure we all supported Sasuke killing Itachi originally as a fandom. But in universe - Itachi graduated in a year and was a captain in Konoha's Black Ops squad by the time he was Sasuke's age. As far as Kakashi is concerned if Sasuke doesn't turn away from his path he is going to die. Itachi will take him apart and put him back together and then take him apart again.\n\nIt's funny that you're accusing others of cherry picking canon while you're doing the same. In that particular moment in the story Kakashi was very much in the right. Sasuke, at the time, simply hadn't shown the aptitude Itachi had at the same age.\n\nKeep in mind that Kakashi knew exactly what was required of someone in Konoha's ANBU. So yeah, at that point in time in canon we saw an experienced ninja, one of Konoha's best, telling his student that if he kept on his path to try and kill Itachi he was going to die. Sasuke was a talented kid, but he hadn't given off any indication that he possessed the ability to surpass Itachi. Could Kakashi have worded it better? Absolutely, but no one has ever accused Kakashi of being mentally well adjusted.\n\nIt's a harsh truth but at that point in time, with all that Kakashi knew and all that the readers knew, Itachi was beyond the reach of everyone in canon not including the dead Hokage. Orochimaru, the biggest villain at the time, admitted to being weaker than Itachi. At least I think it was in part 1? I could be wrong been a long time since I read the manga. Can't remember if it was in part 1 or two that Orochimaru admits that.\n\nI don't think Sasuke was a cunt or anything in part 1, he was very much a traumatized kid at the time and the thought of revenge kept him going. But saying that Kakashi wasn't supportive of him is just factually incorrect. Unless assisting a 13 year old in committing suicide by mass murdering elder brother is your idea of being supportive?",

You're either speed reading or skipping over my comment completely.\n\n**You're missing the point.** The point I made was that *Kakashi was being supportive of Sasuke as best he could*. He, as Sasuke's team leader and teacher, was telling his student that if Sasuke did not stop going after revenge, he was going to die. This is a harsh truth that no one had sat down and spoken to Sasuke about before. **Of course it didn't work but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.**\n\n*You said the following -*\n\nKakashi straight up told Sasuke to... How exactly is that being on his side?\"\n\n*My main point is:* **This is incorrect. Kakashi was very much on Sasuke's side.** As I explained in my comment above.\n\nNow to go on a tangent about the other things you mentioned:\n\nKakashi does the best he can with what he is given. Saying that he wasn't supportive of his student is incorrect. *I never once said that Sasuke received any emotional help in the village*. *His lack of a proper support structure* is what allowed Orochimaru to get his fangs into Sasuke in the first place.\n\nIt's almost like a fictional ninja village training kids to become soldiers for the sake of the state is not the best place to go looking for emotional support structures especially by modern standards.\n\n**That's sort of the whole tragedy of Sasuke's story.** It wasn't that people went out of their way to ignore him, but that the structure of the society they grew up in was not designed to create happy, well adjusted people. **How to change this society and make it better was the main source of conflict between Naruto and Sasuke in part 2. And was the underlying conflict in Naruto.**\n\nAs they grow up and become adults, both Naruto and Sasuke realize that they world they live in needs to change. They arrive at two different conclusions based off their personal experiences. Kishimoto gives us multiple different viewpoints on this topic. That's the underlying lesson/ message/ conflict in Naruto.",

What do you think would any mentally unstable tortured teen feel when their whole world turns upside down. They become really unstable. He just wanted to inflict pain on the leaf.\n\nBut he calmed down soon enough and basically did nothing except empty threats. After talking to the hokages and Itachi again instead of just empty pain he wanted a revolution.\n\nMaybe morally questionable killing the kages and tailed beast? But can you blame him. The system was cruel rotten to the core and no one wanted to change anything apart from people putting everyone in a massive fake world. Naruto too was all just blind talk that trust in me i will change everything without any iota of idea.\n\nSasuke is definitely smarter than Itachi. Itachi had blind patriotism, Sasuke did not. He understood why village was made but also understood to not be blindly patriotic to a point where you kill your family torture your younger brother. \n\nEven at the end he goes on a voluntary exile to see smallfolk. Like the Sasuke Shinden story where he busts a slave ring which ninja villages conveniently ignore.",

Choji and Neji even almost died.\n\n> Even if you say earlier with Orochimaru that Sasuke was purposefully not killing innocents, that definitely changes later. Karin said it multiple times, that he was growing darker.\n\nYes, that's the point. He withstood multiple challenges without breaking to kill Itachi. And once he did, Obito did the emotional equivalent to him of Bane breaking Bruce's back over his knee.\n\nSo I don't understand what your point is.\n\nAnd both times Sasuke tried to kill Sakura, she was trying to first.\n\nAnd Sasuke dealt with it head on as well. Doesn't get anymore head on that than seeking justice for those killed.\n\nOn the other hand I'd say letting Sarada grow up alone is not dealing it with it head on anymore. He's usually emotionally blank now which is to be expected.\n\nI'm not saying what Sasuke did was good. I'm saying it was par for the course in shinobi world. And the reason Naruto \"dealt with it head on\" the way you mean it is because he actually had Iruka care for him while he was young.\n\nThey let Sasuke grow up alone in the empty Uchiha residential area.\n\nHashirama said his goal for creating the village was not only to stop wars but to supersede clans. But no one even adopted Sasuke despite having nothing against him unlike Naruto.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

People wanting to ignore all his bad simply because his family was murdered and his brother was not the best don't make sense. Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for. He could have gone next level if he stayed he was simply impatient. All in all you can understand why someone does what they did but still call out their bad behavior as such",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

However he was manipulated by his family and village. He was given the task of stopping his family's coup by murdering them and he knew if he didn't they'd just find someone else to take care of things. This at least gave him some measure of control over the situation but he'd still be carrying the weight of what he did with him forever. If I'm not mistaken he knew about Obito and what was to come and wanted Sasuke to be strong. Why he thought the only way to do so was to stroke Sasuke's already massive revenge boner idk like I said he wasn't a good brother or as good a person as made out to be although he at least seemed to try to limit the Akatsukis body count although I could be wrong it's been awhile. Basically this is a long winded way of saying if we're willing to justify what Sasuke did it's not far fetched to also give itachi some slack.",

My comment isn't concerned with that, its getting the point across of how Sasuke\u2019s thought process works and how his desire for revenge is valid.

Unless you've conveniently forgotten the Senju and Uchiha were always bitter rivals. You say Sasuke hating sand wanting to destroy the leaf is justifiable because off the deaths off hiss clan, by that same stance the 2nd hating and placing restrictions on the Uchiha is justifiable as well. But completely ignoring all that, the reason they could not own property, or hold positions of power outside the peacekeeping Corps is because they could literally brainwash people. It's just pragmatic. The entire world of Naruto has huge asymmetry, if you allowed the Uchiha all the same rights as the regular run of thee mill villagers, they could easily mindrape them into giving away their property and livelihood. They would be an oppressed minority if they weren't literally genetically superior Aryan Ubermensch Ninjas. With the way the inheritance of the Mangekyo works, literally 1 in 2 Uchiha could acquire it at minimum, more if they were taught to encouraged to make friends outside the clan, and then manipulated into fighting and cutting ties with them. They had restrictions because they were legitimately dangerous, but no one treated them like shit like Naruto was treated. They were a revered, respected and up until they shit the bed and decided to fuck themselves over, an honorable and loyal clan. I'll concede that it's all technically Madaras fault, but they still made shit decisions, to the point that even their own family member decided they needed to be put down.",

See, you've got to look at a character from all angles, backstory, strength, relations, character development and personality, and if you fail to look at all the perspectives, then what's the point of judging him.\n\nEdit: it's like looking at Naruto's clothes and judging his ENTIRE CHARACTER of his black and orange clothes or looking at Kakashi's Sharingan and judging his personality of that.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

Since childhood he believed his older brother slaughtered his family so I\u2019m not really seeing where he behaved like an asshole. He behaved accordingly with the information he had, plus the trauma of those events actually occurring. This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen. He had many other options available to him but he chose to make Naruto\u2019s life as miserable as possible, Root, and putting up the least amount of effort possible to prevent the Uchiha massacre. Keep in mind he\u2019s \u201cgod of shinobi\u201d\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is all a story and we\u2019re only able to have this discussion bc of kishimotos brilliant writing.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Prime example of someone he would have killed would be Sazanka from the previous episode of Boruto.\n\nThat or get shinobi, bandits, samurai, etc causing carnage to serve him instead but if such people refused to serve him, he'd kill them.\n\nSasuke called Itachi the true Hokage but Itachi never adopted the title. If he had, people would still assume he was crazy but he literally couldn't call himself Hokage while wearing the leaf handband crossed out. So I don't think Sasuke was going to do that either.\n\nWhen he said he was going to become Hokage to everyone they assumed he meant the normal way it's used, if he'd instead said something like become Morakage as in Kekkei Mora everyone would think he meant conquer the world but he didn't mean that either.\n\nI don't understand why you have a problem with his character for that though. What plan would you have him come up with instead, because simply going back to village would have been anticlimatic?",

If Sasuke was older, and orochimaru wasn't apart of it, I'd imagine I'd be less of a big deal but they'd still try and stop him at first.\n\nAlso Sasuke leaving the village endangers Naruto as well, which the 3rd hokage and the ANBU/Jonin were trying to protect. Then Tsunade becoming hokage also enforced the need to protect Naruto as she saw what he has the potential to do, and the lengths he'd go to bring back Sasuke. \n\nStill don't like Sasuke. I mean I acknowledge his back story and tragic story but I just don't like his vibe and how he's handled. I don't really like \"cool emos\". Same problem with itachi",

He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came.

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

Instead, he thinks and asks Kakashi and Ino to help him convince Ibuki and Ino's father to interrogate Danzo & the 2 elders. Everyone present learns the truth. Sasuke kills the 2 elders easily and starts fighting with Danzo. Kakashi, Ibuki and Ino's father try to stop him, but the Anbu appear and block them by making the same cage the 4 of the sounds made when Orochimaru fought Hiruzen. They fight the same way they would have fought at the kage summit, but without Karin. Sasuke wins and the Leaf learns about Susano and Danzo's sharingan arm. During the fight, Danzo tried to use Shisui's eye, but it was cancelled by Itachi's crow. Because Naruto was also witnessing the fight with Kakashi and the others.\n\nTobi declares war. Itachi is revived. Sasuke stumbles on Itachi, tells him he returned to the village after winning their fight and that he killed Danzo after learning the truth; from Tobi who tried to recruit him in the Akatsuki.",

Nagato asked him for a solution for peace but he actually didn't give one. He basically said Jiraiya's hope for the world explained through his book is what he was going to strive for no matter how much he suffered but Nagato had obviously read the book as well.\n\nWhatever Sasuke would say to him would carry much more weight because he has the same feelings as him but much stronger than Naruto's and directed towards Konoha too and because Nagato worked with Itachi for a long time.\n\nSasuke should have shown up just in time to catch Yahiko's arm as he was about to run Hinata through causing Naruto to transform. And prior he should have been reflecting in the room with the Uchiha stone tablet.",

After fighting Itachi, Taka rescues him and they lay low for a while. With Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu and Itachi dead, the Akatsuki says they need the fox ASAP and decide to attack Konoha. Plays out like you said. Sasuke saves Hinata and helps Naruto kill all the Pains.\n\nFor Kakashi, it would be he uses his remaining force to kamui the nail, then collapses because he's out of chakra. Pain doesn't bother to check if he's dead, because either way he won't be a hassle.\n\nThen after all this, the Danzo stuff happens. Making even more sense to why Tobi would want Sasuke, because his most emotionally damaged pawn (Nagato) died and he needs a replacement.",

He wasnt ordered to go and join Orochimaru and kill him. He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so.

I think the more fair argument is that they probably wouldn't have given him the same kind of training/ ninja steroids orochumaru gave him, or allowed him to have single mindedly focus only on killing itachi. But orochumaru really just wanted the vessel. Also I'm pretty sure they were in the middle of their \"we need to get rid of the Akatsuki\" plan when they said okay let's send Shikamaru to kill kakazu and hidan. I'm sure given enough time sauske would have definitely been a part of the crew sent to kill itachi when it came time to do so.",

It could be argued that it was for the greater good considering the coup d'etat, but a spade's a spade, and genocide is genocide. Itachi did it out of love for his brother, selflessness, and even dragged his own name through the dirt.\n\nNagato- Died for his crimes, acted in the name of peace through deterrence, undid his most heinous crime.\n\nSasuke- After Naruto and maybe Kakashi/Jiraiya/Itachi, easily the most popular character, would have killed his sensei, his best friend, and his future wife who showed unconditional love. Acted through selfish intent and vengeance alone. I don't mind that he found redemption, since Gaara did too.

But it shows what trauma can do to a person, he would have sinked further if Might Guy did not exist or intervene \n\nGaara could kill because he is psychologically damaged? Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo. And if you could argue if doing bad things for the greater good is justified in ANY CASE,then there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with Sasuke trying to enact his \u201cpeace plan\u201d after defeating Kaguya (even though it was obviously problematic). \n\n Nagato-He only undid what he did to the Leaf in that battle. There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

You're either speed reading or skipping over my comment completely.\n\n**You're missing the point.** The point I made was that *Kakashi was being supportive of Sasuke as best he could*. He, as Sasuke's team leader and teacher, was telling his student that if Sasuke did not stop going after revenge, he was going to die. This is a harsh truth that no one had sat down and spoken to Sasuke about before. **Of course it didn't work but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.**\n\n*You said the following -*\n\nKakashi straight up told Sasuke to... How exactly is that being on his side?\"\n\n*My main point is:* **This is incorrect. Kakashi was very much on Sasuke's side.** As I explained in my comment above.\n\nNow to go on a tangent about the other things you mentioned:\n\nKakashi does the best he can with what he is given. Saying that he wasn't supportive of his student is incorrect. *I never once said that Sasuke received any emotional help in the village*. *His lack of a proper support structure* is what allowed Orochimaru to get his fangs into Sasuke in the first place.\n\nIt's almost like a fictional ninja village training kids to become soldiers for the sake of the state is not the best place to go looking for emotional support structures especially by modern standards.\n\n**That's sort of the whole tragedy of Sasuke's story.** It wasn't that people went out of their way to ignore him, but that the structure of the society they grew up in was not designed to create happy, well adjusted people. **How to change this society and make it better was the main source of conflict between Naruto and Sasuke in part 2. And was the underlying conflict in Naruto.**\n\nAs they grow up and become adults, both Naruto and Sasuke realize that they world they live in needs to change. They arrive at two different conclusions based off their personal experiences. Kishimoto gives us multiple different viewpoints on this topic. That's the underlying lesson/ message/ conflict in Naruto.",

After talking to the hokages and Itachi again instead of just empty pain he wanted a revolution.\n\nMaybe morally questionable killing the kages and tailed beast? But can you blame him. The system was cruel rotten to the core and no one wanted to change anything apart from people putting everyone in a massive fake world. Naruto too was all just blind talk that trust in me i will change everything without any iota of idea.\n\nSasuke is definitely smarter than Itachi. Itachi had blind patriotism, Sasuke did not. He understood why village was made but also understood to not be blindly patriotic to a point where you kill your family torture your younger brother. \n\nEven at the end he goes on a voluntary exile to see smallfolk.

Choji and Neji even almost died.\n\n> Even if you say earlier with Orochimaru that Sasuke was purposefully not killing innocents, that definitely changes later. Karin said it multiple times, that he was growing darker.\n\nYes, that's the point. He withstood multiple challenges without breaking to kill Itachi. And once he did, Obito did the emotional equivalent to him of Bane breaking Bruce's back over his knee.\n\nSo I don't understand what your point is.\n\nAnd both times Sasuke tried to kill Sakura, she was trying to first.\n\nAnd Sasuke dealt with it head on as well. Doesn't get anymore head on that than seeking justice for those killed.\n\nOn the other hand I'd say letting Sarada grow up alone is not dealing it with it head on anymore. He's usually emotionally blank now which is to be expected.\n\nI'm not saying what Sasuke did was good. I'm saying it was par for the course in shinobi world. And the reason Naruto \"dealt with it head on\" the way you mean it is because he actually had Iruka care for him while he was young.\n\nThey let Sasuke grow up alone in the empty Uchiha residential area.\n\nHashirama said his goal for creating the village was not only to stop wars but to supersede clans. But no one even adopted Sasuke despite having nothing against him unlike Naruto.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for. He could have gone next level if he stayed he was simply impatient. All in all you can understand why someone does what they did but still call out their bad behavior as such",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

However he was manipulated by his family and village. He was given the task of stopping his family's coup by murdering them and he knew if he didn't they'd just find someone else to take care of things. This at least gave him some measure of control over the situation but he'd still be carrying the weight of what he did with him forever. If I'm not mistaken he knew about Obito and what was to come and wanted Sasuke to be strong. Why he thought the only way to do so was to stroke Sasuke's already massive revenge boner idk like I said he wasn't a good brother or as good a person as made out to be although he at least seemed to try to limit the Akatsukis body count although I could be wrong it's been awhile.

Itachi was plain manipulative and abusive, but tbh Sasuke did rebel against his wish to protect Konoha. For someone who\u2019s so \u201ceasily manipulated\u201d, he didn\u2019t do what people wanted him to do at all, especially Naruto.\nAnd he himself said that revenge is the only thing that kept him alive. If he was such an emo depressed boy he would have killed himself when he was 7 and forced to relive his clan\u2019s massacre over and over again.

I'll grant you he managed to resist those manipulating him just long enough to throw a tantrum like a petulant child and \ud83d\udca9 on those who cares about him.

My comment isn't concerned with that, its getting the point across of how Sasuke\u2019s thought process works and how his desire for revenge is valid.

Unless you've conveniently forgotten the Senju and Uchiha were always bitter rivals. You say Sasuke hating sand wanting to destroy the leaf is justifiable because off the deaths off hiss clan, by that same stance the 2nd hating and placing restrictions on the Uchiha is justifiable as well. But completely ignoring all that, the reason they could not own property, or hold positions of power outside the peacekeeping Corps is because they could literally brainwash people. It's just pragmatic. The entire world of Naruto has huge asymmetry, if you allowed the Uchiha all the same rights as the regular run of thee mill villagers, they could easily mindrape them into giving away their property and livelihood. They would be an oppressed minority if they weren't literally genetically superior Aryan Ubermensch Ninjas. With the way the inheritance of the Mangekyo works, literally 1 in 2 Uchiha could acquire it at minimum, more if they were taught to encouraged to make friends outside the clan, and then manipulated into fighting and cutting ties with them. They had restrictions because they were legitimately dangerous, but no one treated them like shit like Naruto was treated. They were a revered, respected and up until they shit the bed and decided to fuck themselves over, an honorable and loyal clan. I'll concede that it's all technically Madaras fault, but they still made shit decisions, to the point that even their own family member decided they needed to be put down.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great.

This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen. He had many other options available to him but he chose to make Naruto\u2019s life as miserable as possible, Root, and putting up the least amount of effort possible to prevent the Uchiha massacre. Keep in mind he\u2019s \u201cgod of shinobi\u201d\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is all a story and we\u2019re only able to have this discussion bc of kishimotos brilliant writing.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Theirs also the fact that he was the last loyal Uchiha and their only hope for reviving the clan in the leaf village, getting revenge on Itachi did nothing to aid that goal and the process highly endangered Sasuke an incredibly valuable asset at the time.",

If Sasuke was older, and orochimaru wasn't apart of it, I'd imagine I'd be less of a big deal but they'd still try and stop him at first.\n\nAlso Sasuke leaving the village endangers Naruto as well, which the 3rd hokage and the ANBU/Jonin were trying to protect. Then Tsunade becoming hokage also enforced the need to protect Naruto as she saw what he has the potential to do, and the lengths he'd go to bring back Sasuke. \n\nStill don't like Sasuke. I mean I acknowledge his back story and tragic story but I just don't like his vibe and how he's handled. I don't really like \"cool emos\". Same problem with itachi",

Those years of training were nothing but a race between the two, could Sasuke become strong enough to fight him off before he was ready to take his body.\n\nKakashi has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher. He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came.

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

He wasnt ordered to go and join Orochimaru and kill him. He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so. Also, when Naruto told him about Neji, Lee, Choji put their lives on life for him, he told Naruto he doesnt give a shit about them.

But orochumaru really just wanted the vessel. Also I'm pretty sure they were in the middle of their \"we need to get rid of the Akatsuki\" plan when they said okay let's send Shikamaru to kill kakazu and hidan.

Acted through selfish intent and vengeance alone. I don't mind that he found redemption, since Gaara did too. His actions towards those who loved him and intent are just significantly worse than everyone else's outside of maybe Gaara, but Gaara loved his siblings through and through for what it's worth.",

Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo. And if you could argue if doing bad things for the greater good is justified in ANY CASE,then there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with Sasuke trying to enact his \u201cpeace plan\u201d after defeating Kaguya (even though it was obviously problematic). \n\n Nagato-He only undid what he did to the Leaf in that battle. There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

He goes rogue and basicly joins a S-rank criminal or whatever (orochimaru)  to kill itachi.\nNaruto wants to avenge jiraijya, but he doesn't immediately leave the village or whatever, he trains hard to learn sage mode and to get stronger, then saves the hidden leaf and talks with nagato  and then he's satisfied.\nThere's a big difference in whta these 2 did to get revenge, and after getting revenge sasuke wants to kill EVERY SINGLE PERSON from the hidden leaf while alot of them couldn't do shhit about the uchiha massacre , so it does make sense that naruto gets supported but sasuke doesn't, right?",

You're either speed reading or skipping over my comment completely.\n\n**You're missing the point.** The point I made was that *Kakashi was being supportive of Sasuke as best he could*. He, as Sasuke's team leader and teacher, was telling his student that if Sasuke did not stop going after revenge, he was going to die. This is a harsh truth that no one had sat down and spoken to Sasuke about before. **Of course it didn't work but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.**\n\n*You said the following -*\n\nKakashi straight up told Sasuke to... How exactly is that being on his side?\"\n\n*My main point is:* **This is incorrect. Kakashi was very much on Sasuke's side.** As I explained in my comment above.\n\nNow to go on a tangent about the other things you mentioned:\n\nKakashi does the best he can with what he is given. Saying that he wasn't supportive of his student is incorrect. *I never once said that Sasuke received any emotional help in the village*. *His lack of a proper support structure* is what allowed Orochimaru to get his fangs into Sasuke in the first place.\n\nIt's almost like a fictional ninja village training kids to become soldiers for the sake of the state is not the best place to go looking for emotional support structures especially by modern standards.\n\n**That's sort of the whole tragedy of Sasuke's story.** It wasn't that people went out of their way to ignore him, but that the structure of the society they grew up in was not designed to create happy, well adjusted people. **How to change this society and make it better was the main source of conflict between Naruto and Sasuke in part 2. And was the underlying conflict in Naruto.**\n\nAs they grow up and become adults, both Naruto and Sasuke realize that they world they live in needs to change. They arrive at two different conclusions based off their personal experiences. Kishimoto gives us multiple different viewpoints on this topic. That's the underlying lesson/ message/ conflict in Naruto.",

They have the village and probably eventually would have had the whole Ninja world breathing down their necks to take care of their rogue ninja. They were in a no win situation.

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

However he was manipulated by his family and village. He was given the task of stopping his family's coup by murdering them and he knew if he didn't they'd just find someone else to take care of things. This at least gave him some measure of control over the situation but he'd still be carrying the weight of what he did with him forever. If I'm not mistaken he knew about Obito and what was to come and wanted Sasuke to be strong. Why he thought the only way to do so was to stroke Sasuke's already massive revenge boner idk like I said he wasn't a good brother or as good a person as made out to be although he at least seemed to try to limit the Akatsukis body count although I could be wrong it's been awhile. Basically this is a long winded way of saying if we're willing to justify what Sasuke did it's not far fetched to also give itachi some slack.",

Unless you've conveniently forgotten the Senju and Uchiha were always bitter rivals. You say Sasuke hating sand wanting to destroy the leaf is justifiable because off the deaths off hiss clan, by that same stance the 2nd hating and placing restrictions on the Uchiha is justifiable as well. But completely ignoring all that, the reason they could not own property, or hold positions of power outside the peacekeeping Corps is because they could literally brainwash people. It's just pragmatic. The entire world of Naruto has huge asymmetry, if you allowed the Uchiha all the same rights as the regular run of thee mill villagers, they could easily mindrape them into giving away their property and livelihood. They would be an oppressed minority if they weren't literally genetically superior Aryan Ubermensch Ninjas. With the way the inheritance of the Mangekyo works, literally 1 in 2 Uchiha could acquire it at minimum, more if they were taught to encouraged to make friends outside the clan, and then manipulated into fighting and cutting ties with them. They had restrictions because they were legitimately dangerous, but no one treated them like shit like Naruto was treated. They were a revered, respected and up until they shit the bed and decided to fuck themselves over, an honorable and loyal clan. I'll concede that it's all technically Madaras fault, but they still made shit decisions, to the point that even their own family member decided they needed to be put down.",

See, you've got to look at a character from all angles, backstory, strength, relations, character development and personality, and if you fail to look at all the perspectives, then what's the point of judging him.\n\nEdit: it's like looking at Naruto's clothes and judging his ENTIRE CHARACTER of his black and orange clothes or looking at Kakashi's Sharingan and judging his personality of that.",

I guess I'm not a \"fan\" in your book which alright whatever I'm still a fan in my book. No one is obligated to like anything that I like what I like. I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen.

Right before he left she was sad about what happened but she was still saying she didn't know what she'd do without him.\n\nSasuke did say thank you to her which proves he liked her but he had decided he had more important things to worry about. At the time it was clear to Sasuke that Itachi was out of his mind. So if he had a kid with her before Itachi was dead, in his mind Itachi could try to kill their child or steal its eyes to refocus Sasuke on killing him.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

If Sasuke was older, and orochimaru wasn't apart of it, I'd imagine I'd be less of a big deal but they'd still try and stop him at first.\n\nAlso Sasuke leaving the village endangers Naruto as well, which the 3rd hokage and the ANBU/Jonin were trying to protect. Then Tsunade becoming hokage also enforced the need to protect Naruto as she saw what he has the potential to do, and the lengths he'd go to bring back Sasuke. \n\nStill don't like Sasuke. I mean I acknowledge his back story and tragic story but I just don't like his vibe and how he's handled. I don't really like \"cool emos\". Same problem with itachi",

As I recall he got pretty soundly whipped by him.\n\nOrochimaru is also objectively a terrible human being that did absolutely nothing for Sasuke's emotional or mental health. He had no intention of actually helping him defeat Itachi, he was just juicing him to to be a body that he could steal. Those years of training were nothing but a race between the two, could Sasuke become strong enough to fight him off before he was ready to take his body.\n\nKakashi has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher. He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came. He wouldn't be limited to one teacher in the snake paedophile dungeon.",

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

Nagato asked him for a solution for peace but he actually didn't give one. He basically said Jiraiya's hope for the world explained through his book is what he was going to strive for no matter how much he suffered but Nagato had obviously read the book as well.\n\nWhatever Sasuke would say to him would carry much more weight because he has the same feelings as him but much stronger than Naruto's and directed towards Konoha too and because Nagato worked with Itachi for a long time.\n\nSasuke should have shown up just in time to catch Yahiko's arm as he was about to run Hinata through causing Naruto to transform. And prior he should have been reflecting in the room with the Uchiha stone tablet.",

After fighting Itachi, Taka rescues him and they lay low for a while. With Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu and Itachi dead, the Akatsuki says they need the fox ASAP and decide to attack Konoha. Plays out like you said. Sasuke saves Hinata and helps Naruto kill all the Pains.\n\nFor Kakashi, it would be he uses his remaining force to kamui the nail, then collapses because he's out of chakra. Pain doesn't bother to check if he's dead, because either way he won't be a hassle.\n\nThen after all this, the Danzo stuff happens.

It could be argued that it was for the greater good considering the coup d'etat, but a spade's a spade, and genocide is genocide. Itachi did it out of love for his brother, selflessness, and even dragged his own name through the dirt.\n\nNagato- Died for his crimes, acted in the name of peace through deterrence, undid his most heinous crime.\n\nSasuke- After Naruto and maybe Kakashi/Jiraiya/Itachi, easily the most popular character, would have killed his sensei, his best friend, and his future wife who showed unconditional love. Acted through selfish intent and vengeance alone. I don't mind that he found redemption, since Gaara did too. His actions towards those who loved him and intent are just significantly worse than everyone else's outside of maybe Gaara, but Gaara loved his siblings through and through for what it's worth.",

But it shows what trauma can do to a person, he would have sinked further if Might Guy did not exist or intervene \n\nGaara could kill because he is psychologically damaged? Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo. And if you could argue if doing bad things for the greater good is justified in ANY CASE,then there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with Sasuke trying to enact his \u201cpeace plan\u201d after defeating Kaguya (even though it was obviously problematic). \n\n Nagato-He only undid what he did to the Leaf in that battle. There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

Let's not forget unless and correct me if I'm wrong in general the way rogue ninja were dealt with is death something team 7 and co has tried to stall to give Sasuke a second chance. If we're considering Sasuke's mental state and everything he's going through to make poor decisions we also have to look at theirs. They have the village and probably eventually would have had the whole Ninja world breathing down their necks to take care of their rogue ninja. They were in a no win situation. Also to say Sasuke attempting to murder them is justified by them also making the decision to killed him isn't a good argument and ignores a lot. They had tried before to do things differently.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for.

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Sasuke was good looking, minded his own business, worked hard, has a respectable goal of wanting to avenge his family.  \n\n\nTalking about man babies while defending a literal pipsqueak that threw a temper tantrum on the daily cause no one paid him attention and patted him on his head and just cause Sasuke had girls lol  \n\n\nUnderstand the concept of revenge and politics also, this series is not your naruto self insert fanfic. Sasuke's clan was killed for konoha's sake, it wouldn't be revenge if he didn't target the village for the clan. What's the use killing a few officials when they didn't order the massacre for themselves but Konoha? Use your head, not just incel projections",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

In the story its fucking awesome as as I mentioned in a diff thread, Sasuke is the best written character in the show/manga. I just don't like him. And the ad hominem doesn't help your point. I'll have you know that work in a laboratory at children's hospital in my town so I a lot of pride in the job that I found years ago. It sounds like you might be projecting a bit and that you need to find something with a little more substance in your life.",

Since childhood he believed his older brother slaughtered his family so I\u2019m not really seeing where he behaved like an asshole. He behaved accordingly with the information he had, plus the trauma of those events actually occurring. This is all before his brother showed him the truth basically destroying everything sasuke came to terms with, while adding the burden of not being able to help Itachi throughout this entire journey but rather killing him. Sure other people might have rolled over and said from the beginning \u201cit is what it is\u201d but you can\u2019t hold it against sasuke for going the opposite route to avenge all that was taken from his life. It\u2019s a testament to everyone\u2019s individuality.\n\nA lot of Naruto characters who people refer to as villains aren\u2019t completely immoral. Majority are pursuing a sense of justice/peace they believe doesn\u2019t exist because of the conditions they were unwillingly placed in. \n\nExample of an immoral asshole: Hiruzen. He had many other options available to him but he chose to make Naruto\u2019s life as miserable as possible, Root, and putting up the least amount of effort possible to prevent the Uchiha massacre. Keep in mind he\u2019s \u201cgod of shinobi\u201d\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is all a story and we\u2019re only able to have this discussion bc of kishimotos brilliant writing.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

As I recall he got pretty soundly whipped by him.\n\nOrochimaru is also objectively a terrible human being that did absolutely nothing for Sasuke's emotional or mental health. He had no intention of actually helping him defeat Itachi, he was just juicing him to to be a body that he could steal. Those years of training were nothing but a race between the two, could Sasuke become strong enough to fight him off before he was ready to take his body.\n\nKakashi has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher. He taught them the effectiveness of teamwork and what being a team actually meant with the bell test. He took Sasuke from being folded by WEIGHTED Lee to being able to match his unweighted speed and doing legitimate damage to Gaara with the Chidori in the space of a month. Imagine what he could do in years, and he would actually be looking after Sasuke as a person.\nHe was also instrumental in Naruto learning the Rasenshuriken as well as Sage mode thanks to his insight about using Shadow Clones. \n\nHe would also have literally the entire village to learn from and back him up when the time came. He wouldn't be limited to one teacher in the snake paedophile dungeon.",

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

After fighting Itachi, Taka rescues him and they lay low for a while. With Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu and Itachi dead, the Akatsuki says they need the fox ASAP and decide to attack Konoha. Plays out like you said. Sasuke saves Hinata and helps Naruto kill all the Pains.\n\nFor Kakashi, it would be he uses his remaining force to kamui the nail, then collapses because he's out of chakra. Pain doesn't bother to check if he's dead, because either way he won't be a hassle.\n\nThen after all this, the Danzo stuff happens.

Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so.

He goes rogue and basicly joins a S-rank criminal or whatever (orochimaru)  to kill itachi.\nNaruto wants to avenge jiraijya, but he doesn't immediately leave the village or whatever, he trains hard to learn sage mode and to get stronger, then saves the hidden leaf and talks with nagato  and then he's satisfied.\nThere's a big difference in whta these 2 did to get revenge, and after getting revenge sasuke wants to kill EVERY SINGLE PERSON from the hidden leaf while alot of them couldn't do shhit about the uchiha massacre , so it does make sense that naruto gets supported but sasuke doesn't, right?",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for.

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

Right before he left she was sad about what happened but she was still saying she didn't know what she'd do without him.\n\nSasuke did say thank you to her which proves he liked her but he had decided he had more important things to worry about. At the time it was clear to Sasuke that Itachi was out of his mind. So if he had a kid with her before Itachi was dead, in his mind Itachi could try to kill their child or steal its eyes to refocus Sasuke on killing him.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so. Also, when Naruto told him about Neji, Lee, Choji put their lives on life for him, he told Naruto he doesnt give a shit about them.

Okay so was Sasuke, being mindraped for 72 hours straight and having a curse marl from a pedo snake isn\u2019t going to make you a mentally stable person. Not to mention Uchihas with Magenkyo Sharingan are supposed to be insane. If it applies for Gaara, it applies for Sasuke too. \n\nAnd for Itachi, no matter what his true intent lies,  his execution and the impact of his actions were horrible. He was a bad a brother, torturing your own brother and brainwashing him, Sasuke would have stayed in the village if Itachi hadn\u2019t go \u201ckill your teammates, you\u2019re so weak\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started on there are also other Uchiha children at the same time of the massacre that deserve to live as much as Sasuke did. But still, I could argue he is just as brainwashed by the village as many others were. The Leaf as a system is just horrible imo.

There is no reverse for all the lives he killed before that battle, particularly those from his own country which he turned into a battlefield or his own teacher (ngl if you hate Sasuke for trying to lay a hand on Kakashi, the same would go for Pain killing Jiraiya or it\u2019s just hypocripsy) \n\nAnd no my point isn\u2019t telling people you cannot hate on Sasuke my point is the fandom are so hypocritical",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for.

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Tobirama have him the stink eye? He proceeds to get pummeled by Hashirama constantly and enacts some decades long plan to stage a comeback but is unwittingly the puppet of a plant man who wants to free his space alien mum that isn't going to be mentioned until the last five minutes.\n\nObito heroically sacrificed himself for his comrades and village, then goes off his nut when Rin does the exact same thing and decides to fuck the village and end the world. He never grows out of his teenage emo phase and goes all in on the most basic interpretation of nihilism, totally disrespecting his loves dying intention. Then he switches back at the last second and calls it good after causing the deaths of hundreds.\n\nFugaku has the two most powerful Uchiha since Madara under him, his own Son being praised as having the mind of a Hokage. Dude decides to stage a fucking coup instead of waiting the half a decade it would take for Itachi to actually become Hokage.\nWhy? Because racism. We never see a single Uchiha treated poorly, Itachi and Sasuke were lauded at the academy. They're the police force of the village. But they get butthurt because they're logically suspected of being involved in the Nine Tails attack, no one could have known it was Obito so the only Sharingans to control the thing were in the village. If Fugaku had any brains he'd be looking at his own people as well and trying to solve shit but no.\n\nItachi decides with his Hokage caliber mind, the best solution to tension in the village is to side with obvious maniac Danzo and a suspicious fellow in a mask with a Sharingan to murder his entire family. Except his beloved brother, who he's going to mentally torture in order to encourage him to become strong. Repeatedly. Which directly leads to his brother becoming a raging maniac. He only gets it right when he accidentally gets hit with the genjutsu he intended to brainwash Sasuke with. That was his entire plan. Murder family. Make brother too crazy and powerful to fuck with. Subsequently brainwash him into following Itachi's objectives without ever telling him the truth. \n\nShisui has literally the most powerful genjutsu in existence that doesn't need a giant space plant to work. Dude could have averted the entire coup by turning up to one meeting. Instead he loses one eye to Danzo, gives the other to Itachi and just kills himself.\n\nAnd we know all about Sasuke.\n\nEvery single Uchiha is a moron who wouldn't know the right decision if it bit them on the ass.",

He left the village on his own terms just to seek power to kill Itachi. Now I am not saying he was wrong in doing so cause he required Orochimaru's help to kill Itachi but he definitely betrayed the leaf in doing so. Also, when Naruto told him about Neji, Lee, Choji put their lives on life for him, he told Naruto he doesnt give a shit about them. If thats not betraying your village and your villagers then I don't know what is.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for. He could have gone next level if he stayed he was simply impatient. All in all you can understand why someone does what they did but still call out their bad behavior as such",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

Right before he left she was sad about what happened but she was still saying she didn't know what she'd do without him.\n\nSasuke did say thank you to her which proves he liked her but he had decided he had more important things to worry about. At the time it was clear to Sasuke that Itachi was out of his mind. So if he had a kid with her before Itachi was dead, in his mind Itachi could try to kill their child or steal its eyes to refocus Sasuke on killing him.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told.

We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great.

I just don't like him. And the ad hominem doesn't help your point. I'll have you know that work in a laboratory at children's hospital in my town so I a lot of pride in the job that I found years ago.

Right before he left she was sad about what happened but she was still saying she didn't know what she'd do without him.\n\nSasuke did say thank you to her which proves he liked her but he had decided he had more important things to worry about. At the time it was clear to Sasuke that Itachi was out of his mind. So if he had a kid with her before Itachi was dead, in his mind Itachi could try to kill their child or steal its eyes to refocus Sasuke on killing him.",

True his backstory is tragic and it begs the question which is worse having your family killed or never knowing them at all. There's a reason parallels are drawn between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was the pariah of the village until he showed he had something to offer. Sasuke while uneatable acted brooding and depressed and secluded himself from his peers. He had found a second family in team 7 but was too naive plus the curse mark bs to realize it. Sasuke was so busy with the past he couldn't get his head out of his bum for 2 seconds to look to the future with anything but a revenge boner. His actions are understandable but by no means justified. Similarly bad/ stupid decisions team 7 and co make are understandable but not justified. Let's not forget however that team 7 with much detriment to themselves I might add do try to save him relentlessly before the fool convinces them he's too far gone and has to be put down like a rapid dog as most rogue ninja are. As even after the curse mark is lifted his continues down the wrong/ dark path without even trying to lean on his friends who would have no doubt been up to exposing the villages past crimes. It's an everyone sucks here that's all both made mistakes both made bad decisions but yeah Naruto's blunders are usually easier to stomach than the guy wanting to become just as bad as those who wronged him. There's a saying two wrongs don't make a right for a reason something surprising Naruto figured out before Sasuke",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

And sasuke wouldn't be dead without team 7 probably just in jail cause who could actually stop him at the end of the war besides naruto, sasuke wasn't even that whiny either people over exaggerate that, and don't make what ifs about the third he was old orochimaru beat him that's it, and I remember sasuke acting way calmer in the early parts of shippuden when he still had the mark, and him being more aggressive after losing it \"cough\" five kage summit karin literally mentions sasukes Chakra is colder than when hes in the curse mark second state.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and plenty of people don't like those but I don't get pissed when people say they're trash. I'd simply disagree. I look at Sasuke's character from all angles but because he's fictional, I can judge him all I want. Just because you and others enjoy him doesn't mean that I have to at all. And I don't see how that's bad or harming your Sasuke experience. You fuck with him? That's great. I simply don't.\n\nEdit: those are physical traits that have nothing to do with a characters behavior. My dislike of Sasuke comes from his (albeit understandable) actions and behaviors",

People wanting to ignore all his bad simply because his family was murdered and his brother was not the best don't make sense. Most behavior while he has the curse mark can be excused because well the curse mark but once that was gone and he the truth or at least what Obito told him and knew his brother wanted to protect the village. You can't claim to love your brother and then throw a tantrum like a petulant child and actively spit and take a dump on his memory and everything he fought and sacrificed for. He could have gone next level if he stayed he was simply impatient. All in all you can understand why someone does what they did but still call out their bad behavior as such",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory.

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

I already said it but it applies here. Help and support was available to him he just refused to accept it.

A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

The decision came from high up and the rest of the village knew nothing but what they were told. Commiting mass murder because your family was mass murdered is stupid and worth the hatred he gets from the fandom for it. We can understand why Sasuke did what he did but he was by no means a golden boy and deserves most of the dislike by the fandom. True he could be treated with more nuance but generally he was a really \ud83d\udca9 person and we can make excuses for his bs or better yet just acknowledge he's a sucky person. He back story is sad but there's characters with worse stories who don't end up like him. Shoot pain had more or a reason to be a psychopath but in the end turned around. Sasuke ends up being nothing but a whiny impatient brat for most of his life and frankly would be dead if it wasn't for team 7 and their unending quest to save him. Yeah he's stuck in the past constantly ( like his lovestruck fan base) using his past to excuse his horrible life choices. The rest of Naruto's class isn't anything to put ones nose at either. They're powerful Ninja. Orochimaru only beat the third hokage because he was old at the time if he'd been in his prime he'd have handed orochimaru his butt on a platter. Naruto worked 10x harder than Sasuke not to mention Naruto's life literally depended on leveling up given who was after him. I thought it was stated that Sasuke went a little out of his mind due to the mark. He certainly seemed to exhibit more  aggression with the mark. He was a \ud83d\udca9 person who made \ud83d\udca9 and tiny violin back story can't excuse all of it.",

And sasuke wouldn't be dead without team 7 probably just in jail cause who could actually stop him at the end of the war besides naruto, sasuke wasn't even that whiny either people over exaggerate that, and don't make what ifs about the third he was old orochimaru beat him that's it, and I remember sasuke acting way calmer in the early parts of shippuden when he still had the mark, and him being more aggressive after losing it \"cough\" five kage summit karin literally mentions sasukes Chakra is colder than when hes in the curse mark second state.",

Also if he doesn't care about being better than donzo he deserves to be treated like donzo. Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

And sasuke wouldn't be dead without team 7 probably just in jail cause who could actually stop him at the end of the war besides naruto, sasuke wasn't even that whiny either people over exaggerate that, and don't make what ifs about the third he was old orochimaru beat him that's it, and I remember sasuke acting way calmer in the early parts of shippuden when he still had the mark, and him being more aggressive after losing it \"cough\" five kage summit karin literally mentions sasukes Chakra is colder than when hes in the curse mark second state.",

Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

Cross the line and expect to be treated as such. Pain wasn't a good guy and definitely we shouldn't forget the crap he did however by your own logic with Sasuke it's ok because he has a really sad back  so anything he does is perfectly fine. If Sasuke's proposed genocide of the leaf is fine then so is pains actual genocide. Sasuke just isn't a character that really deserves the backing he almost exclusively makes bad decisions and he can only gain so much sorrow points for he bad backstory. He let his past break him that's on him. He actions are his actions and he's judged by them rightfully so.",

A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work.

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",

The reason is because he never gives up even though he wasn't that strong thanks to Kurama messing up his chakra.\n\nHe says Boruto is an even bigger Usuratonkachi than Naruto because it's not a derogatory term.\n\nIt means thin hammer which is fitting. A thin hammer will take a while to put nails in wood but with effort it will still work. Likewise it took Naruto a long time to use Rasengan one handed and Boruto lost against Deepa but defeated him after training.",
