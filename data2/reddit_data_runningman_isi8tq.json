Is that too far-fetched a conclusion based on that search?\n\nI'm not offended btw. I was kind of hoping for Cunningham's Law to take effect if I was wrong. :)",

About the videos you posted is precisely what I'm talking about it, mostly it's not samba. Latin music doesn't always involves samba, there are lots of rhythms in there but ppl prefer calls everything samba. We have different variation of samba like for example it happens in Rock'n roll but in the end it's rock the same goes for our music. And I don't think ppl from salsa, rumba, tango etc like to see those musics addressed like the same thing as samba when they're not.",

About the videos you posted is precisely what I'm talking about it, mostly it's not samba.

We have different variation of samba like for example it happens in Rock'n roll but in the end it's rock the same goes for our music. And I don't think ppl from salsa, rumba, tango etc like to see those musics addressed like the same thing as samba when they're not.",
