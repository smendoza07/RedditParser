    "body": "I saw another thread here where one of the top responses was one of you SD guys saying the girl who wrote the original post was over-educated, under-employed, in debt, making poor decisions, and using SA like an aspiring escort.\n\nI just have to...really? wow.\n\nDouble-standard much? But it's not even that. I'm used to the double-standard where you can have tons of sex with strangers but if a girl does it, she's a ho.\n\nIt's more...have some compassion for this poor girl. This may surprise you, guys, but there's no class in school for how to do \"this\" right. Every single girl who you meet this way has walked, alone, into a room with a guy who wants to use her body. Every single girl you take to your hotel is hoping you follow her \"rules' and don't hurt her. And I guarantee you that every single one of them is silently praying that you keep up your end of the deal and actually fucking \\*PAY\\* her the way you're supposed to. We're terrified about all this stuff because sometimes it doesn't happen. Because some guys force things. Some guys like to cause pain. Some guys don't think \"they\" should have to pay. And no one wants it to be \"like a transaction\" (which pretty much always turns into \"let's have sex and I'll pretend I'm going to pay you another time\").\n\nDo you know how terrifying it is to put yourself out there? To deal with 100 creepy come-ons for every legit contact you make?\n\nMaybe you do know what it's like to feel like your drowning in debt (hint...it feels like you're drowning!), but I'd take a bet that pretty much none of you guys has ever agreed to let a stranger paw you or had to have the courage to demand a condom while some guy who's as old as your dad, three times as big as you, and a million times more rich/powerful/entitled is doing everything he can to \"accidentally\" put it in bare.\n\nI don't know anything about that girl who wrote that article. She did come across as a little...off to me, too. But not every girl who is doing \"this\" and not getting it exactly right is clueless. Sometimes we're still learning. Sometimes we're even acting a certain way because it's what we've learned works with the guys we've been with. Or sometimes we're just too fucking scared to do anything else.\n\nRemember the person, ok? Especially if it's a naive little 20 year old who is drowning in debt.\n\nMaybe, even, be thankful that there are girls who are willing to say \"Yah, I'll do it with guys for money...because it is exciting, I enjoy sex, and I have to pay rent\". If you have the luck to meet someone like this and if you have even the slightest connection with her, then treat her right. She'll be the best friend you could ever hope for! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\nEdit: wow. This blew up! And it sounds so bad. I didn\u2019t mean to sound so angry! I just wanted us to be nice to each other. This is fun and exciting! Or, it\u2019s supposed to be. And when we make mistakes we laugh and learn and keep going. The guys I\u2019ve met doing this have almost all been amazing gentlemen - but the learning curve is steep.",

            "body": "I got a taste of this perspective several years ago. She was 19. The m&g had gone well enough.  She was shy/timid but admitted she was new to this,  so I accepted that she just needed to get comfortable.  We worked out terms and had our first date the next night.  I told her that I was happy to go slow and see her platonicaly until she was ready to go further,  but she insisted she was ready at the end of dinner.  I could tell she tensed up while clothing came off and I was sure she was not ok shorty after she started oral.  I asked if she was sure she was ready for this and she started sobbing. With some comforting,  she shared she had an infant at home and child protective services was coming back in two days to make sure she had her power turned back on or they would take the baby.  \n\nWhat was fun and games to me was what she needed to do not to lose her baby. I called and paid the power bill right then and there. I gave her the envelope i already had for her and sent her home to her baby.\n\nIf you check my post history,  I have made some unpopular comments about not treating sugaring as transactional relationships with an escort and this girl is where that started for me. Since her, I prefer a little older SB, I am happy to be patient and wait until they are ready to move things along.  I genuinely want a SR we are both glad to be in. ",

It gets easier once you get to know the guy, but those first few interactions require ignoring the blaring red \"danger\" alarm going off in your head that has warned you about stranger danger for years.

Im gonna leverage my youth and beauty while I have it to ( pay off loans, make that down payment, build up my IRA, get that Gucci bag, etc.)  I know we hear \"I like older men\", but seriously. How many young women think \" I can't wait to nab an old man my Dad's age or Granddad's because i find an overweight, bald, alcoholic ,cigar smoking geezer attractive? I thought so -not too many. \n\nSo ,while I sympathize with the risks,dangers, and disgust that SBs have to bear, in the end they are adults and need to be present to make responsible decisions. Here are some suggestions:    \n1) don't sugar-it is risky, potentially dangerous, and often disgusting    \n2)If you DO sugar:    \n      a- prepare thoroughly by studying all the information in these pages     \n      b-decide on your limits and stick to them.  If you don't like anal--don't do it.    \n      c-establish a backup system with friends,family. If you are going to play make sure you are not alone.    \n      d-ALWAYS negotiate an allowance BEFORE going for intimacy.  Yes, it is awkward ,but you have to get over it. Playing this game requires dealing with tough situations and negotiating with your elders who are better at it than you are. But never forget. You have 100% of what the POT is looking for. Without your agreement and consent he will not get to play with you.      \n      e-ALWAYS collect allowance up front before intimacy. (see f). Yes- it is hard to do and awkward and transactional ,but sugar IS such a thing. We just pretend that it isn't. It gets easier after the deed is done and the deal is in place.     \n      g-  Run at the first sign of weirdness. If you think something is off, it usually is.     \n      h-I could go on and on, but you've heard it all before. NOBODY is going to look after your wellbeing like you will. So do it.  \n\n",

            "body": "Your post is very strong and very true. \n\nYet, I believe those problems do reside in the choices made by the SBs that suffer from bad experiences. \n\nI'm a female and have been through some of the hardships you described. However, when looking back at each of those bad times, I always realized how stupid my decisions were.\n\nHaving debts is bad...REAL bad. Money rule this world, so does power. \n\nEmpowering oneself is the main tool that a female has to develop. How to do it ? It's all about the perception that you have about yourself. Sure, it won't pay your bills, but it will help you remember where you are and what your goals are.\n\nReading the whole Intern story, the main aspect that hits me is how lost she is. Her self-esteem is extremely low and most of the time, she's not aware of the reasons behind her decisions except: making money. Where is she? Who is she? That's what made me sad when reading her dairy. \n\nThere's indeed no class on how to behave as a SB, but in 2019, you have access to this Forum, testimonies like that one (The Intern), and plenty other stories on the net. There's also the possibility of meeting other SBs. The goal is to open up to the right people by learning how to screen the demands.  The goal is to step out of the dark.\n\nThere's also an adamant rule to Sugaring which not a lot of younger SBs seems to understand. \n\nNever Sugar Out of Despair ! EVER ! \n\nBy doing so, the SB will always end up in the most shitty situations. That's just the basic logic of submissiveness and dominance.  But if that logic isn't understood, then time has yet to come before joining the bowl. \n\n*I understand that some people really find themselves in deep trouble and will admit that I have no clue how they'll get out of that rabbit hole, but I know for sure that hell will be paid million time before and IF they do get out. I feel deeply sadden for the faith of those individuals.*\n\nVictimisation is a dangerous path. It leads to conclusions based on biased and extremely shocking situations, but the truth is, more often than not, there's 2 sides involved. Some situations truly deserve to be labeled as such, but they include specific components which clearly demonstrate the complete lack of control and/or freedom of the victim. A SB getting herself in a SR freely (none obstent the financial struggle) doesn't fit as a victim unless she's being kidnapped, coarse or worse. Same rule apply for SDs, just with different type of struggles.\n\nFinally, money is dangerous. It's a tool and has to be handled as such. Money doesn't bring life, nor death, but it can become a tool for one or the other if not carefully managed. Maturity in handling money has to be developed through life experience and, if lucky, by the teaching of parents, teachers or very close friends.\n\nIf every SB would join the bowl with a clear mindset, goals already established and a good opinion of herself, the struggles would definitely lessen. \n\nNo, it's not easy to get it \"wet\" with a much older guy, and yes the douch will always hang around, but as you learn how to swim in this huge pool, you'll avoid the obvious escort seekers and the less obvious insane men.\n\nThe 2nd adamant rule to Sugaring\n\nStep by Step Screening/Veting ! Especially if your young and beautiful. Take it slow before going to a first date, ask questions, feel the man throughout his texts, learn the red signs \n\nExamples : \nDo you offer anal? = Next !\nI'm successful and will never pay or need to pay for sex! = Next! \nWant to come to my place for the M&G? = Next! \nWanna come to a party tonight babe? = Next!\n\nLearning how respectful older men talk to women is a must. Being upfront yet tactful is a must. Learning how to say no, is a definite must. Learning what it means to be a SB is a must. Learning why your POT SD wants a SB is a must. And the list could go on and on.\n\nYes, some men have to learn how to treat women properly. Women need to learn how to treat themselves properly first before engaging with men. And women need to learn how to treat men properly. \n\n\nThat's it, so long, way too long...",

Your experiences are not necessarily the experiences of others and especially those your comment seems to be directed at; if your advice is coming directly from your own perspective, the scope of its benefit is limited. Much of your original comment contains helpful advice!

Does anyone really think someone in a desperate situation and entering the bowl is going to read the statement 'you should not sugar out of despair' and think 'Oh gee, I guess that's true. Now I'm going to stay out of the bowl until I'm financially stable!'. Of course not. It's like telling a drug addict 'Don't do drugs' vs 'Don't do drugs but if you must, here's how to use needles safely etc'. (Bad analogy but I'm in class and multitasking lol)\n\nWith your revision above, yes they're going to skip straight past the first sentence but maybe actually gain something useful by understanding *why* they will be vulnerable and how they can take steps to minimize it.",

There\u2019s almost a palpable desperation in her writing and it opens her up to a lot of hurt.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is expecting us to get it right 100% of the time, but at least listen to your instincts.

I've never met or seen even 1 homeless attractive/average looking woman.  Why? Because even a average woman always knows at least 1 man they can call and stay with indefinitely \"in trade\". If you are a man in this world, and if you do not have a family/real friends to lean on, you are completely on your own and you will be sleeping under a bridge with maybe some free WiFi. :-) :-)  This is my reality.\n\nIf i need to make some \"gig\" money from a 2nd job, I can turn on a food delivery app and maybe make $10-$20 an hour. Any woman over a \"5\" can sugar or escort and make in 1 hour what would take me 20.  Many camgirls can make $3000-$50,000 a month literally from sitting in front of a computer, from anywhere in the world, selling something that cost them nothing to obtain and can be resold over and over.\n\nThose women who cry about not having electricity, money or whatever could easily go get a retail job, or food delivery or any one of 1000 other \"normal\" jobs, put their head down and work hard.  Or they can choose to go the path of least resistance/highest pay in going towards sex-work.  At least they get that choice.   \n\nI read that article and she mentioned she had like 15 roommates.

I don't think being male is going to make the money in my wallet less attractive to a robber.\n\nI would argue based on my 20+ years of corporate that women have 100% power. If any woman at my workplace walked into an HR office and even said i made them feel uncomfortable for any reason, I would be fired without proof or any real reason, because its cheaper to find a replacement for me than a possible lawsuit.  It has actually happened to me already and cost me many thousands of dollars frivolously. I only talk about business with women in business and keep a distance, making no friends. Workplaces gave gotten fairly hostile towards men and I don't bother making women friends under 50 in the workplace anymore. Insecure 20 somethings are a disaster. If i was a woman in my industry, i could have less skills, and get a 25% raise to help boost some companies EEOC/sex quota for hiring minorities in IT (my field). As of recently, California is REQUIRING women to be on corporate boards, qualified or not.  \n\nNot every woman gets asked for her number or catcalled. I think most obese women would be the first to tell you that they are virtual ghosts... But you aren't trying to \"save\" those girls, are you?\nYou act like every woman is a potential victim waiting to happen. I just understand that there is an acceptance of risk just even walking out the front door each day. Most people do.\nIt is fine to be charitable. I buy my broke neighbor groceries all the time asking nothing in return. But that is what it is.. Charity.  Charity and compassion only go so far.  If she really has no money, she qualifies for SNAP, WIC, and a number of other programs, plus she should be collecting child support from her baby daddy, since she decided to have kids prior to an education or a real income. \n\nBut my points about her enhanced earning ability still remain.  She is not a victim. She put herself exactly in the circumstances she chose, based on her own decisions.\n",

I cannot speak to your hiring practices and I commend you on hiring based on talent. I'm sure you do work hard, but it does not mean that HR didn't get to check off a box in interviewing you and they are still reporting all of those statistics annually, patting themselves on the back for being so inclusive regardless of merit.\nNot sure what field you work in that required you to dress so neutral. Men appreciate a well dressed woman, I would argue your biggest enemies on that will be other women. :-)\nAs for the insinuations, I can only tell you that in many IT jobs, they do not even interview you (see government) unless you are a woman or minority unless you have a special skill that they cannot find anywhere else. Don't believe me? Go apply for any IT job on USAjobs that pays under 150K. Some hiring managers say \"hire the next woman that walks thru the door\", that is not your fault or say anything to the merits of how qualified you are, it just is the way it is with the world today.\n\nHow do you define success? Lots of money? A gratefulness to wake up each day and breathe fresh air? A job you enjoy and a roof overhead?\n\nI am not complaining, I am just telling you the way it is. There is a difference. Your statement about men \"not being as smart, skilled or having a personality issue\" for pointing out the differences is just garbage. If it makes you feel better, you should keep believing it... I had a work permit the day i turned 14, worked at an internet provider 2 years later and worked at a firm in DC at age 18 when everyone else started off college. I went to college at night and paid cash.  I earned everything I have in this life, there was no shortcuts. So I know you most certainly couldn't be talking about me. :-) :-)\n",

And by personality issues, I mean they literally have faults that prevent them from getting the next promotion.  This isn't really what I'm talking about, but to be honest and frank, I wouldn't want a manager who has a chip on his shoulder about women having it so \"easy\" or whatever word/phrase fits. \n\nIf you are open to hearing some of the things I have dealt with that more women than men deal with by far (always exceptions), I'd be happy to share to help perhaps provide a different perspective.  The things that are perceived by some white men as so unfair came about because of the disparity in how women or minorities have often been treated.  Often unintentionally.  So many don't even realize they are doing it.\n\nAgain, some and often - not all or always.\n\nI have worked with many amazing men, have had friendships with many more.  Until sugaring recently, I'll be honest that I was naive about how many probably wanted to sleep with me.  But I never realized it because they treated me like a human and not a sex object.  And in the end, isn't that what we all want, to be treated fairly?  Or at least not treated differently because of something we have no control over.    \n\nSometimes people use policies and programs inappropriately, but that doesn't mean the intent behind them was malicious.  It was to help one portion of people, not to harm anyone, despite what some seem to believe.  And to be very clear, the vast majority of the men I've worked with and the experiences I've had are good and positive.  The exceptions are unfortunate, and suck, and hopefully over time the frequency with which those things happen will continue to reduce.  The things that frustrate you so much have been implemented with that intention.",

You said...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  If you are in a SR with someone who is effectively your boyfriend, who you know intimately, there is a lot less chance of \\[bad things that are done by men to women\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYah, so, um, you're kinda saying \"it's her fault for acting like an escort\" which sounds a lot like saying \"look at how she was dressed, she asked for it!\" Right?\n\nYou also seem to be saying that a girl who wants to explore sugaring should only do it with guys who are already effectively her boyfriend? Wow! That's a great idea! I'm sure every girl who steps into the bowl has a boyfriend-quality guy in her back pocket just aching to help her out, right? Because if we did, would be be posting a profile?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Of course there is risk to both parties in any relationship but if you  are seeing one man regularly, you have built up trust and respect, then a  lot of what you are describing is no longer a worry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk to the guy=being laughed at? Catching something? Being outed to his wife? All bad, for sure! But...\n\nRisk to the girl: Rape, death, pregnancy, being laughed at, catching something, and being outed to the real world.\n\nHow is it that you think a new SB should get to the point where she is \"seeing one man regularly\" who \"is effectively her boyfriend\"? Ya have to start somewhere. And, trust me, if I tell a guy on SA I want to date him for a while so that we feel like boy/girlfriends, ask yourself, how many stick around? (Hint: almost none.) You men want to move quickly - and that's not bad, but let's just not get all high and mighty and say it's the girl's fault.\n\nIf a human doesn't wait for consent, or hurts without permission, or stealths, or forces himself on her, then that is his crime. FULL STOP. I don't give a crap what she did beforehand. She always has the right to say \"No. Stop.\"\n\n> It's when SBs see a lot of different men, with little screening, and  with little time between the M&G and the first date that the  experience is more like what you describe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh my god! You're right. I had never thought of it this way. Totally, because the girl chose to a different guy yesterday that some guy today thinks he can smack her around? That makes her less worthy of protection? Compassion? Human rights? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

It's not for the faint of heart.  It's not easy and it can produce very bad long term traumatisms.\n\nThe bowl is not a game. Even for a woman who think she knows how to do it, she can realize very quick that it won't work but \"MONEY\"! That's the problem.  If you're not desperate, you can quit as per your judgment. If not, the relationship will most certainly get worse.\n\nBut that's been said over and over. \n\nI still understand the OP's plea and wish her well.",

Your experiences are not necessarily the experiences of others and especially those your comment seems to be directed at; if your advice is coming directly from your own perspective, the scope of its benefit is limited. Much of your original comment contains helpful advice! But your oversimplified world view (and as an older SB, I'm assuming?) is shown in idealistic statements like 'If every SB would join the bowl with a clear mindset, goals already established and a good opinion of herself, the struggles would definitely lessen.' That would be great but it is simply not the world we live in, particularly in a bowl that attracts young and naive teenagers, people with little self worth and people in precarious financial situations - whether we like it or not.

Does anyone really think someone in a desperate situation and entering the bowl is going to read the statement 'you should not sugar out of despair' and think 'Oh gee, I guess that's true. Now I'm going to stay out of the bowl until I'm financially stable!'. Of course not.

Not all SBs are the same either.  I didn't become an SB until mid 30s (and no, I'm still not 43, I use my real age)",

Honestly a quick way to go broke.\nWhen i do deliveries.  There is a risk of being robbed, killed or anything else, especially in a bad neighborhood. I have a concealed gun permit. I don't think being male is going to make the money in my wallet less attractive to a robber.\n\nI would argue based on my 20+ years of corporate that women have 100% power. If any woman at my workplace walked into an HR office and even said i made them feel uncomfortable for any reason, I would be fired without proof or any real reason, because its cheaper to find a replacement for me than a possible lawsuit.  It has actually happened to me already and cost me many thousands of dollars frivolously. I only talk about business with women in business and keep a distance, making no friends. Workplaces gave gotten fairly hostile towards men and I don't bother making women friends under 50 in the workplace anymore. Insecure 20 somethings are a disaster. If i was a woman in my industry, i could have less skills, and get a 25% raise to help boost some companies EEOC/sex quota for hiring minorities in IT (my field). As of recently, California is REQUIRING women to be on corporate boards, qualified or not.  \n\nNot every woman gets asked for her number or catcalled. I think most obese women would be the first to tell you that they are virtual ghosts... But you aren't trying to \"save\" those girls, are you?\nYou act like every woman is a potential victim waiting to happen. I just understand that there is an acceptance of risk just even walking out the front door each day. Most people do.\nIt is fine to be charitable. I buy my broke neighbor groceries all the time asking nothing in return. But that is what it is.. Charity.  Charity and compassion only go so far.  If she really has no money, she qualifies for SNAP, WIC, and a number of other programs, plus she should be collecting child support from her baby daddy, since she decided to have kids prior to an education or a real income. \n\nBut my points about her enhanced earning ability still remain.  She is not a victim. She put herself exactly in the circumstances she chose, based on her own decisions.\n",

I want to preface this with I was not a sugar baby until very recently, nor did I sleep with anyone even remotely related to work ever.  So please remove that lens from your judgement.\n\nI worked my ass off to get where I am.  I made conscious decisions to not be note taker in meetings, make coffee (I don't drink it), bring homemade treats, or look overtly feminine so I would be treated equally, and not as a \"girl\".  You have any idea what it's like to be accused of sleeping your way there, or it being insinuated you got where you were because of your gender or race?\n\nI'm not naive, it makes it easier to get an interview, I'm sure.  I would argue though, that no high level manager in their right mind would hire someone at my level who wasn't the best for the job.\n\nAnd as I hiring manager, I have NEVER considered anything other than if the person was best for the job.  I remember hiring an older gentleman one time and later someone saying, why did you hire someone so close to retirement?  It hadn't even occurred to me, he was the best qualified.\n\nMost of the men who I know that complain are either not as smart, skilled, or have a personality issue that prevents them from being more successful.  Not because they are a man. \n\nI'm going to leave all your other points alone for now.",

I cannot speak to your hiring practices and I commend you on hiring based on talent. I'm sure you do work hard, but it does not mean that HR didn't get to check off a box in interviewing you and they are still reporting all of those statistics annually, patting themselves on the back for being so inclusive regardless of merit.\nNot sure what field you work in that required you to dress so neutral. Men appreciate a well dressed woman, I would argue your biggest enemies on that will be other women. :-)\nAs for the insinuations, I can only tell you that in many IT jobs, they do not even interview you (see government) unless you are a woman or minority unless you have a special skill that they cannot find anywhere else. Don't believe me? Go apply for any IT job on USAjobs that pays under 150K. Some hiring managers say \"hire the next woman that walks thru the door\", that is not your fault or say anything to the merits of how qualified you are, it just is the way it is with the world today.\n\nHow do you define success? Lots of money? A gratefulness to wake up each day and breathe fresh air? A job you enjoy and a roof overhead?\n\nI am not complaining, I am just telling you the way it is. There is a difference. Your statement about men \"not being as smart, skilled or having a personality issue\" for pointing out the differences is just garbage. If it makes you feel better, you should keep believing it... I had a work permit the day i turned 14, worked at an internet provider 2 years later and worked at a firm in DC at age 18 when everyone else started off college. I went to college at night and paid cash.  I earned everything I have in this life, there was no shortcuts. So I know you most certainly couldn't be talking about me. :-) :-)\n",

I didn't say you, I will emphasize the statement was about men I personally know who have complained to me.\n\nHard work does not equal smart or skilled.  And by personality issues, I mean they literally have faults that prevent them from getting the next promotion.  This isn't really what I'm talking about, but to be honest and frank, I wouldn't want a manager who has a chip on his shoulder about women having it so \"easy\" or whatever word/phrase fits. \n\nIf you are open to hearing some of the things I have dealt with that more women than men deal with by far (always exceptions), I'd be happy to share to help perhaps provide a different perspective.  The things that are perceived by some white men as so unfair came about because of the disparity in how women or minorities have often been treated.  Often unintentionally.  So many don't even realize they are doing it.\n\nAgain, some and often - not all or always.\n\nI have worked with many amazing men, have had friendships with many more.  Until sugaring recently, I'll be honest that I was naive about how many probably wanted to sleep with me.  But I never realized it because they treated me like a human and not a sex object.  And in the end, isn't that what we all want, to be treated fairly?  Or at least not treated differently because of something we have no control over.    \n\nSometimes people use policies and programs inappropriately, but that doesn't mean the intent behind them was malicious.  It was to help one portion of people, not to harm anyone, despite what some seem to believe.  And to be very clear, the vast majority of the men I've worked with and the experiences I've had are good and positive.  The exceptions are unfortunate, and suck, and hopefully over time the frequency with which those things happen will continue to reduce.  The things that frustrate you so much have been implemented with that intention.",

Wow! That's a great idea! I'm sure every girl who steps into the bowl has a boyfriend-quality guy in her back pocket just aching to help her out, right? Because if we did, would be be posting a profile?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Of course there is risk to both parties in any relationship but if you  are seeing one man regularly, you have built up trust and respect, then a  lot of what you are describing is no longer a worry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk to the guy=being laughed at? Catching something? Being outed to his wife? All bad, for sure! But...\n\nRisk to the girl: Rape, death, pregnancy, being laughed at, catching something, and being outed to the real world.\n\nHow is it that you think a new SB should get to the point where she is \"seeing one man regularly\" who \"is effectively her boyfriend\"? Ya have to start somewhere. And, trust me, if I tell a guy on SA I want to date him for a while so that we feel like boy/girlfriends, ask yourself, how many stick around? (Hint: almost none.) You men want to move quickly - and that's not bad, but let's just not get all high and mighty and say it's the girl's fault.\n\nIf a human doesn't wait for consent, or hurts without permission, or stealths, or forces himself on her, then that is his crime. FULL STOP. I don't give a crap what she did beforehand. She always has the right to say \"No. Stop.\"\n\n> It's when SBs see a lot of different men, with little screening, and  with little time between the M&G and the first date that the  experience is more like what you describe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh my god! You're right. I had never thought of it this way. Totally, because the girl chose to a different guy yesterday that some guy today thinks he can smack her around? That makes her less worthy of protection? Compassion? Human rights? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Your experiences are not necessarily the experiences of others and especially those your comment seems to be directed at; if your advice is coming directly from your own perspective, the scope of its benefit is limited. Much of your original comment contains helpful advice! But your oversimplified world view (and as an older SB, I'm assuming?) is shown in idealistic statements like 'If every SB would join the bowl with a clear mindset, goals already established and a good opinion of herself, the struggles would definitely lessen.' That would be great but it is simply not the world we live in, particularly in a bowl that attracts young and naive teenagers, people with little self worth and people in precarious financial situations - whether we like it or not.

Does anyone really think someone in a desperate situation and entering the bowl is going to read the statement 'you should not sugar out of despair' and think 'Oh gee, I guess that's true. Now I'm going to stay out of the bowl until I'm financially stable!'. Of course not. It's like telling a drug addict 'Don't do drugs' vs 'Don't do drugs but if you must, here's how to use needles safely etc'. (Bad analogy but I'm in class and multitasking lol)\n\nWith your revision above, yes they're going to skip straight past the first sentence but maybe actually gain something useful by understanding *why* they will be vulnerable and how they can take steps to minimize it.",

Honestly a quick way to go broke.\nWhen i do deliveries.  There is a risk of being robbed, killed or anything else, especially in a bad neighborhood. I have a concealed gun permit. I don't think being male is going to make the money in my wallet less attractive to a robber.\n\nI would argue based on my 20+ years of corporate that women have 100% power. If any woman at my workplace walked into an HR office and even said i made them feel uncomfortable for any reason, I would be fired without proof or any real reason, because its cheaper to find a replacement for me than a possible lawsuit.  It has actually happened to me already and cost me many thousands of dollars frivolously. I only talk about business with women in business and keep a distance, making no friends. Workplaces gave gotten fairly hostile towards men and I don't bother making women friends under 50 in the workplace anymore. Insecure 20 somethings are a disaster. If i was a woman in my industry, i could have less skills, and get a 25% raise to help boost some companies EEOC/sex quota for hiring minorities in IT (my field). As of recently, California is REQUIRING women to be on corporate boards, qualified or not.  \n\nNot every woman gets asked for her number or catcalled. I think most obese women would be the first to tell you that they are virtual ghosts... But you aren't trying to \"save\" those girls, are you?\nYou act like every woman is a potential victim waiting to happen. I just understand that there is an acceptance of risk just even walking out the front door each day. Most people do.\nIt is fine to be charitable. I buy my broke neighbor groceries all the time asking nothing in return. But that is what it is.. Charity.  Charity and compassion only go so far.  If she really has no money, she qualifies for SNAP, WIC, and a number of other programs, plus she should be collecting child support from her baby daddy, since she decided to have kids prior to an education or a real income. \n\nBut my points about her enhanced earning ability still remain.  She is not a victim. She put herself exactly in the circumstances she chose, based on her own decisions.\n",

Men appreciate a well dressed woman, I would argue your biggest enemies on that will be other women. :-)\nAs for the insinuations, I can only tell you that in many IT jobs, they do not even interview you (see government) unless you are a woman or minority unless you have a special skill that they cannot find anywhere else. Don't believe me? Go apply for any IT job on USAjobs that pays under 150K. Some hiring managers say \"hire the next woman that walks thru the door\", that is not your fault or say anything to the merits of how qualified you are, it just is the way it is with the world today.\n\nHow do you define success? Lots of money? A gratefulness to wake up each day and breathe fresh air? A job you enjoy and a roof overhead?\n\nI am not complaining, I am just telling you the way it is. There is a difference. Your statement about men \"not being as smart, skilled or having a personality issue\" for pointing out the differences is just garbage. If it makes you feel better, you should keep believing it... I had a work permit the day i turned 14, worked at an internet provider 2 years later and worked at a firm in DC at age 18 when everyone else started off college. I went to college at night and paid cash.  I earned everything I have in this life, there was no shortcuts. So I know you most certainly couldn't be talking about me. :-) :-)\n",

I didn't say you, I will emphasize the statement was about men I personally know who have complained to me.\n\nHard work does not equal smart or skilled.  And by personality issues, I mean they literally have faults that prevent them from getting the next promotion.  This isn't really what I'm talking about, but to be honest and frank, I wouldn't want a manager who has a chip on his shoulder about women having it so \"easy\" or whatever word/phrase fits. \n\nIf you are open to hearing some of the things I have dealt with that more women than men deal with by far (always exceptions), I'd be happy to share to help perhaps provide a different perspective.  The things that are perceived by some white men as so unfair came about because of the disparity in how women or minorities have often been treated.  Often unintentionally.  So many don't even realize they are doing it.\n\nAgain, some and often - not all or always.\n\nI have worked with many amazing men, have had friendships with many more.  Until sugaring recently, I'll be honest that I was naive about how many probably wanted to sleep with me.  But I never realized it because they treated me like a human and not a sex object.  And in the end, isn't that what we all want, to be treated fairly?  Or at least not treated differently because of something we have no control over.    \n\nSometimes people use policies and programs inappropriately, but that doesn't mean the intent behind them was malicious.  It was to help one portion of people, not to harm anyone, despite what some seem to believe.  And to be very clear, the vast majority of the men I've worked with and the experiences I've had are good and positive.  The exceptions are unfortunate, and suck, and hopefully over time the frequency with which those things happen will continue to reduce.  The things that frustrate you so much have been implemented with that intention.",

Wow! That's a great idea! I'm sure every girl who steps into the bowl has a boyfriend-quality guy in her back pocket just aching to help her out, right? Because if we did, would be be posting a profile?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Of course there is risk to both parties in any relationship but if you  are seeing one man regularly, you have built up trust and respect, then a  lot of what you are describing is no longer a worry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk to the guy=being laughed at? Catching something? Being outed to his wife? All bad, for sure!

Ya have to start somewhere. And, trust me, if I tell a guy on SA I want to date him for a while so that we feel like boy/girlfriends, ask yourself, how many stick around? (Hint: almost none.) You men want to move quickly - and that's not bad, but let's just not get all high and mighty and say it's the girl's fault.\n\nIf a human doesn't wait for consent, or hurts without permission, or stealths, or forces himself on her, then that is his crime. FULL STOP. I don't give a crap what she did beforehand. She always has the right to say \"No. Stop.\"\n\n> It's when SBs see a lot of different men, with little screening, and  with little time between the M&G and the first date that the  experience is more like what you describe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh my god! You're right. I had never thought of it this way. Totally, because the girl chose to a different guy yesterday that some guy today thinks he can smack her around? That makes her less worthy of protection? Compassion? Human rights? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Men appreciate a well dressed woman, I would argue your biggest enemies on that will be other women. :-)\nAs for the insinuations, I can only tell you that in many IT jobs, they do not even interview you (see government) unless you are a woman or minority unless you have a special skill that they cannot find anywhere else. Don't believe me? Go apply for any IT job on USAjobs that pays under 150K. Some hiring managers say \"hire the next woman that walks thru the door\", that is not your fault or say anything to the merits of how qualified you are, it just is the way it is with the world today.\n\nHow do you define success? Lots of money? A gratefulness to wake up each day and breathe fresh air? A job you enjoy and a roof overhead?\n\nI am not complaining, I am just telling you the way it is. There is a difference. Your statement about men \"not being as smart, skilled or having a personality issue\" for pointing out the differences is just garbage. If it makes you feel better, you should keep believing it...

And by personality issues, I mean they literally have faults that prevent them from getting the next promotion.  This isn't really what I'm talking about, but to be honest and frank, I wouldn't want a manager who has a chip on his shoulder about women having it so \"easy\" or whatever word/phrase fits. \n\nIf you are open to hearing some of the things I have dealt with that more women than men deal with by far (always exceptions), I'd be happy to share to help perhaps provide a different perspective.  The things that are perceived by some white men as so unfair came about because of the disparity in how women or minorities have often been treated.  Often unintentionally.  So many don't even realize they are doing it.\n\nAgain, some and often - not all or always.\n\nI have worked with many amazing men, have had friendships with many more.  Until sugaring recently, I'll be honest that I was naive about how many probably wanted to sleep with me.  But I never realized it because they treated me like a human and not a sex object.  And in the end, isn't that what we all want, to be treated fairly?  Or at least not treated differently because of something we have no control over.    \n\nSometimes people use policies and programs inappropriately, but that doesn't mean the intent behind them was malicious.  It was to help one portion of people, not to harm anyone, despite what some seem to believe.  And to be very clear, the vast majority of the men I've worked with and the experiences I've had are good and positive.  The exceptions are unfortunate, and suck, and hopefully over time the frequency with which those things happen will continue to reduce.

You said...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  If you are in a SR with someone who is effectively your boyfriend, who you know intimately, there is a lot less chance of \\[bad things that are done by men to women\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYah, so, um, you're kinda saying \"it's her fault for acting like an escort\" which sounds a lot like saying \"look at how she was dressed, she asked for it!\" Right?\n\nYou also seem to be saying that a girl who wants to explore sugaring should only do it with guys who are already effectively her boyfriend? Wow! That's a great idea! I'm sure every girl who steps into the bowl has a boyfriend-quality guy in her back pocket just aching to help her out, right? Because if we did, would be be posting a profile?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Of course there is risk to both parties in any relationship but if you  are seeing one man regularly, you have built up trust and respect, then a  lot of what you are describing is no longer a worry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk to the guy=being laughed at? Catching something? Being outed to his wife? All bad, for sure! But...\n\nRisk to the girl: Rape, death, pregnancy, being laughed at, catching something, and being outed to the real world.\n\nHow is it that you think a new SB should get to the point where she is \"seeing one man regularly\" who \"is effectively her boyfriend\"? Ya have to start somewhere. And, trust me, if I tell a guy on SA I want to date him for a while so that we feel like boy/girlfriends, ask yourself, how many stick around? (Hint: almost none.) You men want to move quickly - and that's not bad, but let's just not get all high and mighty and say it's the girl's fault.\n\nIf a human doesn't wait for consent, or hurts without permission, or stealths, or forces himself on her, then that is his crime. FULL STOP. I don't give a crap what she did beforehand. She always has the right to say \"No. Stop.\"\n\n> It's when SBs see a lot of different men, with little screening, and  with little time between the M&G and the first date that the  experience is more like what you describe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh my god! You're right. I had never thought of it this way. Totally, because the girl chose to a different guy yesterday that some guy today thinks he can smack her around? That makes her less worthy of protection? Compassion? Human rights? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "body": "When it comes to work, I'm speaking mostly from a technical/IT lens. Not sure what industry you work in. I cannot speak to your hiring practices and I commend you on hiring based on talent. I'm sure you do work hard, but it does not mean that HR didn't get to check off a box in interviewing you and they are still reporting all of those statistics annually, patting themselves on the back for being so inclusive regardless of merit.\nNot sure what field you work in that required you to dress so neutral. Men appreciate a well dressed woman, I would argue your biggest enemies on that will be other women. :-)\nAs for the insinuations, I can only tell you that in many IT jobs, they do not even interview you (see government) unless you are a woman or minority unless you have a special skill that they cannot find anywhere else. Don't believe me? Go apply for any IT job on USAjobs that pays under 150K. Some hiring managers say \"hire the next woman that walks thru the door\", that is not your fault or say anything to the merits of how qualified you are, it just is the way it is with the world today.\n\nHow do you define success? Lots of money? A gratefulness to wake up each day and breathe fresh air? A job you enjoy and a roof overhead?\n\nI am not complaining, I am just telling you the way it is. There is a difference. Your statement about men \"not being as smart, skilled or having a personality issue\" for pointing out the differences is just garbage. If it makes you feel better, you should keep believing it... I had a work permit the day i turned 14, worked at an internet provider 2 years later and worked at a firm in DC at age 18 when everyone else started off college. I went to college at night and paid cash.  I earned everything I have in this life, there was no shortcuts. So I know you most certainly couldn't be talking about me. :-) :-)\n",
