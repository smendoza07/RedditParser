    "body": "I\u2019ve recently broke it off with a long term SD and have been enjoying my time in the bowl talking to and meeting different people, I have connected with 2 great pots but as you never know who can drop off the face of the earth at any moment I took a chance to meet a third seemingly great guy. He text me a lot, asked questions and wanted to get to know me. Great meet and greet where he told me he was semi experienced with two long term previous SBs but this time around had only experienced fakes and flakes who never showed up until me. \n\nThings went well so we schedule our first intimate date which was today, \nWe had lunch during which he told me his ex was a 27 year old playboy model and that he had to break things off because she was pressuring him to get married and have a baby. (Strange as he is late 50s married for over 30 years)\nHe also gave me unsolicited financial advice despite me sitting there knowing full well that I own my own home but would never disclose this, he\u2019s telling me how I need to save up for a deposit so I can buy my own property and seemed a bit more snobby than I remember but generally okay maybe it\u2019s just nerves. Then he says he doesn\u2019t like it feel transactional and I correct him saying that of course it\u2019s transactional in the beginning until you find a good common ground so that money never need be discussed again. \nAfter the meal we head to the hotel we sit in the room having more drinks and he\u2019s legit plying me with alcohol I can handle my drink so I\u2019m still pretty good even after a bottle of wine, at this point he puts it on me. So I politely remind him of the ppm and he says it\u2019s fine it\u2019s in my pocket while he\u2019s showering I check his pocket and sure enough it\u2019s there but he didn\u2019t offer to give it to me. \nHe\u2019s back from the bathroom fully putting it on me, I go into my bag get out some protection and lubricant which he can clearly see and doesn\u2019t object so we do a little fore play. He then tries to slide himself in me with no condom so I\u2019m like hold up and reach for it. Then he\u2019s like my dick is too big for condoms sir you can either try or I leave either way. At this point he begins shaming me by saying \u2018this is what I mean about transactional\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve never had a girl bring her own condoms before out of all the girls I\u2019ve seen I\u2019ve never used one\u2019\nAt this point I\u2019m disgusted that he thinks stating he\u2019s been intimate with a lot of girls and never used protection. I dread to think what this human Petri dish is carrying. \nThen to try and convince me to go raw further he says he\u2019s had the snip, but I called bullshit bc he didn\u2019t mention it in the story about his ex trying to have a baby with him. \nFinally he then says \u2018this is why I usually go for younger girls they\u2019re too inexperienced to object\u2019 for reference I\u2019m only 25\n\nAt this point I\u2019m ready to cause an absolute scene, he played me with alcohol thinking I would be too drunk to object. And tried to Shame me into going raw when he attempted unprotected sex without prior discussion. \n\nI\u2019m 5\u201910 and a former miss world contestant so I\u2019m pretty tall and can stand up for myself and thankfully in the end he gave up, gave me 2/3rds of the ppm and offered to drive me back to the station, \n\nI totally get that some people want to transition into unprotected after being tested and exclusive but I\u2019m genuinely shocked and left shaken by this on the first fucking intimate date. \n\nI\u2019m so angry with myself for forgoing my usual safety protocol and drinking too much after being in the bowl for 4 years, I should have known better,",

I didn't coerce my way there, the women led the way, so I followed.  \n\nMy current SB insisted on protection as we got to know each other.  I respected her wish and used condoms for 4 months.  We are now in a more trusting place and unprotected...but I got to appreciate the protection.  Certainly less mess to clean up. \n\nWhen I was young it was usually the woman who carried the protection.  Several sizes.  In my sugar years, I always bring them...and am ready to use them unless the woman is ok without.  Sometimes in the course of the SR, one of us feels the need for protection, that person brings it.\n\nEntitled pricks are all over the bowl (and outside it).  I guarantee he regrets being a dick to you and the next time (next SB) he will be much nicer.  We need a smack down every once in a while to set our heads straight and get our feet closer to the ground.   The problem with being a prick is you don't see it in the mirror until someone turns on the light.",

But something to consider...the average SD is married, older, works too much and has too many obligations to \"sleep around\".  My SB is my only intimacy for the past 15 years...and the hardest part of any SR is finding the time to actually see her.   My decision to go unprotected (we were much more protected back in my youth because of the unwanted pregnancy issue) really depends on the SB.  A stay-at-home single mom isn't getting out much either, nor is a married woman(my last LTR).  I dated a young nursing student once.  She hooked up one weekend and brought condoms to our next date until she could get tested (which I paid for).  In fact, I've been tested many times...all negative.  Trust goes both ways!\n\nI guess my point is, your average SD isn't living at the Playboy mansion and he's not on social media hook-up apps, ...he's hanging out in the dreary suburbs, with his dreary family and playing golf on weekends.  His SR is truly the only excitement he gets.  You should excuse him if he trusts you enough to bring your petri dish into his life.",

Second, I can last as long as I want with them kinda decreasing sensitivity - so when the woman needs to zen out on a constant rhythm i can do it.  I couldn\u2019t before.  Third, All the other options for where to finish are as good as the others when you take the right perspective.\n\nI was never an intercourse guy - always a foreplay guy.

We are now in a more trusting place and unprotected...but I got to appreciate the protection.  Certainly less mess to clean up. \n\nWhen I was young it was usually the woman who carried the protection.  Several sizes.  In my sugar years, I always bring them...and am ready to use them unless the woman is ok without.  Sometimes in the course of the SR, one of us feels the need for protection, that person brings it.\n\nEntitled pricks are all over the bowl (and outside it).  I guarantee he regrets being a dick to you and the next time (next SB) he will be much nicer.  We need a smack down every once in a while to set our heads straight and get our feet closer to the ground.   The problem with being a prick is you don't see it in the mirror until someone turns on the light.",

So in the bowl and beyond I\u2019m pro condom and make it known. \nThe problem is many people do not make it known then try to coerce which is unfair for everyone.",

But something to consider...the average SD is married, older, works too much and has too many obligations to \"sleep around\".  My SB is my only intimacy for the past 15 years...and the hardest part of any SR is finding the time to actually see her.   My decision to go unprotected (we were much more protected back in my youth because of the unwanted pregnancy issue) really depends on the SB.  A stay-at-home single mom isn't getting out much either, nor is a married woman(my last LTR).  I dated a young nursing student once.  She hooked up one weekend and brought condoms to our next date until she could get tested (which I paid for).  In fact, I've been tested many times...all negative.  Trust goes both ways!\n\nI guess my point is, your average SD isn't living at the Playboy mansion and he's not on social media hook-up apps, ...he's hanging out in the dreary suburbs, with his dreary family and playing golf on weekends.  His SR is truly the only excitement he gets.  You should excuse him if he trusts you enough to bring your petri dish into his life.",

We are now in a more trusting place and unprotected...but I got to appreciate the protection.  Certainly less mess to clean up. \n\nWhen I was young it was usually the woman who carried the protection.  Several sizes.  In my sugar years, I always bring them...and am ready to use them unless the woman is ok without.  Sometimes in the course of the SR, one of us feels the need for protection, that person brings it.\n\nEntitled pricks are all over the bowl (and outside it).

My SB is my only intimacy for the past 15 years...and the hardest part of any SR is finding the time to actually see her.   My decision to go unprotected (we were much more protected back in my youth because of the unwanted pregnancy issue) really depends on the SB.  A stay-at-home single mom isn't getting out much either, nor is a married woman(my last LTR).  I dated a young nursing student once.  She hooked up one weekend and brought condoms to our next date until she could get tested (which I paid for).  In fact, I've been tested many times...all negative.  Trust goes both ways!\n\nI guess my point is, your average SD isn't living at the Playboy mansion and he's not on social media hook-up apps, ...he's hanging out in the dreary suburbs, with his dreary family and playing golf on weekends.  His SR is truly the only excitement he gets.  You should excuse him if he trusts you enough to bring your petri dish into his life.",

So in the bowl and beyond I\u2019m pro condom and make it known. \nThe problem is many people do not make it known then try to coerce which is unfair for everyone.",

My SB is my only intimacy for the past 15 years...and the hardest part of any SR is finding the time to actually see her.   My decision to go unprotected (we were much more protected back in my youth because of the unwanted pregnancy issue) really depends on the SB.  A stay-at-home single mom isn't getting out much either, nor is a married woman(my last LTR).  I dated a young nursing student once.  She hooked up one weekend and brought condoms to our next date until she could get tested (which I paid for).  In fact, I've been tested many times...all negative.  Trust goes both ways!\n\nI guess my point is, your average SD isn't living at the Playboy mansion and he's not on social media hook-up apps, ...he's hanging out in the dreary suburbs, with his dreary family and playing golf on weekends.  His SR is truly the only excitement he gets.  You should excuse him if he trusts you enough to bring your petri dish into his life.",

My SB is my only intimacy for the past 15 years...and the hardest part of any SR is finding the time to actually see her.   My decision to go unprotected (we were much more protected back in my youth because of the unwanted pregnancy issue) really depends on the SB.  A stay-at-home single mom isn't getting out much either, nor is a married woman(my last LTR).  I dated a young nursing student once.  She hooked up one weekend and brought condoms to our next date until she could get tested (which I paid for).  In fact, I've been tested many times...all negative.  Trust goes both ways!\n\nI guess my point is, your average SD isn't living at the Playboy mansion and he's not on social media hook-up apps, ...he's hanging out in the dreary suburbs, with his dreary family and playing golf on weekends.  His SR is truly the only excitement he gets.  You should excuse him if he trusts you enough to bring your petri dish into his life.",
