    "body": "I want to share an experience I had with a pot SD in hopes that other sb's will see early warning signs of potential harm and end the relationship before it materializes into more. \n\nI met a very wealthy SD; the guy is definitely legit. We will call him Tom.  Tom and I met for lunch and before out M&G, he did not make any of our conversation sexual.  At our M&G, we got to know each other and as we were doing so, he was also very open sexually about what he likes/wants, very confident and made the conversation easy and normal.  He was classy about it. He seemed very open and adventurous and I actually really liked that about him.  I thought he could \"lead the way\" in helping me explore myself and sexuality more.  He didn't want exclusivity and told me it would turn him on to share my intimate time with other men with him.  I was all about it.  \n\nFirst intimate date was great. Sex was fun and he even suggested we stop because he wanted to cuddle and talk. He shared very intimate details about his life with me.. I really felt like we bonded. I honestly couldn't wait to see him again. \n\nSecond intimate date.. This is where things take a turn. While we are at dinner, we start talking about some sexual experiences I've had with women and how we might consider doing threesomes.   We go back to his place and start getting naughty. While we are in bed, he goes down on me and I was neatly trimmed, but have a small amount of hair.  He proceeds to tell me that he likes a bare kitty (OK.. No problem).. \"like a 14 year old girl\" \ud83d\ude27.  That's the first \ud83d\udea9.. We continue and he likes to talk, so he tells me to describe the type of woman I would pick up for us to have play time with.  (Earlier, we had kind of discussed how it would be hot to find a woman who was inexperienced with women and how I could show her how to please and be pleased/teach her/show her the ropes/blah blah blah.) So I start to describe this woman and we agree she should be young. So I say she's 20 and he says \"no, younger.\" \ud83d\udea9\ud83e\udd14 so I say (uncomfortably/telling him what he wants to hear), \"OK.. 18\". He doesn't say anything else at that point and we continue.  Deep down, I'm preeeeetty sure he was hoping I'd join him on his trip down pedo road and fantasize about having sex with a CHILD.  Ew.  \n\nOne last red flag.  Initially, we had agreed we didn't want to use condoms. But, before our second date, I had asked him that we start using condoms if we were going to be having other partners. I even brought my own. After we had got inside, I realized I had forgotten them in my car. I told him this and he said that he had some.  He went to go grab them and a toy and he came back with the toy and no condom.  So he didn't honor my request to use protection. \n\nFor all of these reasons, I have decided to tell him I'm no longer interested in continuing a relationship with him.  \n\nI just want to warn the women out there that these are the early warning signs of something bad..  Tom is very wealthy and if our relationship were to continue, I could see so many benefits and potential spoiling.  He is very charming and makes me feel like I can trust him. This is how some men do it.. They reel you in slowly.. Build trust and a connection.. And before you know it, you're in some deep shit and making bad decisions/being put in an uncomfortable situation.  I mean.. He just made some little comments here and there that could be brushed off because they don't seem so bad at the time/insignificant or.. he's wealthy or..  you've got a good connection or.. he's normal/great otherwise. \n\nSome men pump and dump or assault or take advantage of women forthright.  Some men play the long game and are very subtle.",

I am not saying she is victim here nor am I defending her in ANY WAY. But I imagined her decades ago being exactly where you were a few days ago. There was probably a MOMENT very early on  when she could have said fuck you and walked away like OP. Instead, she let herself be enticed by his wealth and went all-in.\n\nEDIT : I should\u2019ve read all the comments first. Apparently I\u2019m not the only one who thought this.",

Send pics of any pedophilic messages or predatory too if you think so. Maybe anonymous tip to some service to keep their eye out? Idk if that's police or something else for that. Sounds to me he probably has actually tried some shit for his desires, probably definitely has downloaded that... Type... Of porn... And maybe even had \"experience\" with his... Desires... And definitely will try to get someone else to be an accomplice again like you. And maybe she agrees to it, maybe because she got groomed. And then they both get in trouble for dumb shit and she gets in deep shit too. If it's just a fantasy with no intention of acting on, or downloading pornography of, then it should be no biggie obviously. But the service you report him can investigate whether he is a danger or a benign fetishist. I also worry about him using his power or wealth to further any general harassment, harassment of interns/subordinates (also happened to me. Workplace sexual harassment of young women is unfortunately real and unsettlingly common), coersion, statutory rape, etc. \n\nIt's fully your choice what you do, but thank you for posting this and keeping the community aware of this actively. Fuck me uuuppp with those ethics and morals. Love this respect for your fellow (wo)man. \n\n\nSeriously though, I have been that uncomfortable woman, too, similar to you, but of course not the same. Not doing comparative suffering here. However, I'm less than five feet tall, usually around 100 pounds, with a high pitched voice, and a young face. When I was eighteen and nineteen on the site years ago, I had several men similar to this be actively pedophilic toward me, asking me to play uncomfortably young, asking about girls technically over the age of consent in my state but still under 18 to join in sex, focusing on an idea of a lack sexual experience that he can \"teach\" me about (which was always wrong, their \"predictions\" about what I want and what I haven't done. I rocketed into this world as a confident freak and been surfing that wave ever since. \ud83e\udd37), and making comments like a weird compliment along the same vein as your exchange about the \"bare kitty\" thing or emphasizing that I'm a \"teenager\".\n\n\nAlso, I've noticed, as a side note here, that men with that inclination (if not full fetish) tended (obviously NOT always and not ONLY this way, but yeah, more often than your average bear) to call pussies \"kitties\" most of the time as well as call me \"baby girl\", \"little girl\", etc. Idk man, I've only heard that language from boomers, but NOT all of them being from that kind of weird place; I think some of the NON... Uh... poor-intentioned like this... men think it's a sexy thing women want to hear. Idk, I always hated it. Maybe other women like it, I have no idea though.\n\n\nThose are firm lines with me now; banning that language from any relationship at all: Not a girl, but a woman. Not a kitty, but a bomb-ass crotch cave. Lol, you know how it be. \ud83e\udd17",
