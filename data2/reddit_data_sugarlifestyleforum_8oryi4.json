And usually when we do get those way off-left handed messages, we tend to reply in that or a similar manner.\nWe all know that he was way too explicit in the 1st message, and tasteless is an understatement. There are women out here that are very open and free when it come to sexting and everything after that. But dont assume every woman is like that. And  it is also in how you approach the subject. He could have put it in his profile in a creative way, or started a convo, and engaged her to see what she was open to. \nAlso men be prepared that if you initiate convo about sex, we are going to respond with a money answer.\nSD and all other men...we (women), know you want SEX...but saying \"true intimacy\" in the first message sounds so much better than..I want to fuck your brains out!!!

He could put some of that in his profile and just communicate with tact and not get right to the sex part in message one.  And if I were a betting person, he didn't read your profile at all. To say:\n\n> \"Your eyes got my attention and reading your profile got me hooked. You seem genuine and real...\" blah blah blah.\n\nReally, cupcake? What about it got your attention and what about it got you hooked? How about you talk about _those_ pieces for a bit? Tease her brain. Get her reading your message and believing that you actually read her !@#$ profile, then maybe she'll read over yours and see if you're compatible.\n\nPretty sure _\"I wanna lick you repeatedly to orgasm\"_ has about as much allure to the POT SB, as the notes I get that say _\"I want to just snuggle with you and suck your dick until you blow\"_. \n\nWhatever.

What I have a problem with is him going straight into a vivid description of his needs before he gets a response to \u201chello\u201d. That\u2019s just a lack of tact. I wouldn\u2019t send a first message talking about all the things I\u2019m going to buy with my allowance. \n\nBesides I wasn\u2019t interested in him as soon as he sent that message and I wasn\u2019t trying to appeal to pander to him. I fully anticipated a curt reply and block. What I do want - probably naively- is that he reconsiders being so rude in the future. But even if he doesn\u2019t at least I feel slightly better instead of constantly internalizing the rage towards men who act like this on SA. \n\n\nFor the record - don\u2019t talk about sex in the first message. Ever. And if you do, can\u2019t get mad if we respond with money. ",

What I have a problem with is him going straight into a vivid description of his needs before he gets a response to \u201chello\u201d. That\u2019s just a lack of tact. I wouldn\u2019t send a first message talking about all the things I\u2019m going to buy with my allowance. \n\nBesides I wasn\u2019t interested in him as soon as he sent that message and I wasn\u2019t trying to appeal to pander to him. I fully anticipated a curt reply and block. What I do want - probably naively- is that he reconsiders being so rude in the future. But even if he doesn\u2019t at least I feel slightly better instead of constantly internalizing the rage towards men who act like this on SA. \n\n\nFor the record - don\u2019t talk about sex in the first message. Ever. And if you do, can\u2019t get mad if we respond with money. ",
