He looked in pain and annoyed by this loveline and was clearly not into it, and the last of it was when the fans attacked him for not playing it up. Pretty sure he asked everyone to stop doing it then. Which was the episode after they showed up to his house (610). \n\nBTW, he wasn't the only one who was dragged. Poor SoMin didn't do anything and still got hate. I think the show just realized for the first time in years that this one portion of the fanbase is seriously messed up and they should stop catering to them. I'm glad. \n\nNow I want them to please also stop ChanMin, because SoMin is getting dragged in yet another delusional loveline moment like jongkook. (People saying she has feelings for SeChan when she herself and SeChan himself have said multiple times on and off the show that this isn't true.) I blame Sukjin for this one. Why can't we just not have lovelines on running man? The fans are clearly not mature enough to handle them, and they're cringe for the most part any ways.",

So I don't think anyone would risk having her in the show on which KJK is a member. No wonder they did not appear again on TV after their affair. \nRegarding KHD's show, due to unavailability of subtitles I couldn't watch it, but I remember that she mentioned that RM never approached her to be a guest on the show.

But fans know that their past story is the reason why they never appear in the same show. And that's true, I still remember KJK once saying that it's common sense not to appear at your ex show. And should avoid each other. Even though the conversation is referred to ChaeRina when she appeared at ICSYV and KJK had to act as if nothing happened. But still, it's awkward. And what KJK said about that also fit with KJK and Eun Hye story. They avoid each other for decades.",

For me, it is possible but the price is, the staff and members will be criticized heavily. \n\nThe teasing happened before is acceptable for natural viewers because JK was teased once in the whole episode.  JK's reaction is considered funny to some. But it is different if YEH come and the members tease them for the whole episode. Nothing fun watching a moody JK again and again. Because a moody JK will show his displease in his voice volume (shouting), in his facial expression (serious face with angry eyes), his action (shoving who makes him mad). Watching him like this for the whole episode, I'm confident netizen will bombard all RM's media social with criticism. \n\nThe loveline between JK-YEH in XMen was fun and heart fluttering because both reciprocated. JK was willing to play along. But the way JK acted everytime YJS teased him in recent years, there is no way he is willing to do it again.\n\nEdit: spelling correction",

Not because they know or do not about the relationship. But because of curiosity. And their behavior is always suspicious.\n\nThat's why Jae Suk once said Eun Hye appeared in every show but not Running Man. Especially Jong Kook in the past so calm when talking about Eun Hye outside of Running Man but acted differently when someone mentioned Eun Hye in Running Man. Of course, everyone will think something going on, and start teasing them. \n\nAnd about Internet Shipper, of course, they will think Jong Kook and Eun Hye were in a relationship before and broke up. Because they avoided each other for no reason. Or did you have any idea why a close friend avoided each other so suddenly?",

It\u2019s just the usual reaching that most shippers do. \n\nYJS makes jokes because he wants to tease KJK. He likes getting a reaction out of one of his closest friends. Using jokes said on a variety show as your prime proof immediately invalidates your entire argument.\n\nYJS and YEH were also very close friends back then. But until the WSG wannabe project, there was little to no interaction between them. So should we now assume that YJS and YEH were avoiding each other too? Based on your logic, that means they also dated. \n\nI know you want to believe that there\u2019s some drama that happened between KJK and YEH so it\u2019s pointless for me to explain. But I just want you to think about the things I\u2019ve mentioned and see if you can notice how much of your points rely on weak theories and wishful thinking.",

And if I'm not mistaken Yoon Eun Hye still appeared in Yoo Jae Suk show to promote her drama right? \n\nFrom what I get after reading about Yoon Eun Hye and her rumored relationship. Only JongKook and GongYoo were two huge celebrities linked with her and had a huge shipper fan base. \n\nFor example , Eun Hye fans always said the reason Eun Hye avoid JongKook was because Eun Hye didn't want to be involved in any dating or relationship rumors again. But she didn't avoid GongYoo eventhough their shipper fanbase is huge than Xman. \n\nSo that means she only cares about her rumors with JongKook and tries her best to avoid that. And the question is why? \n\nThey are close friends in the past. EunHye even begged her fans to stop bashing JongKook in the past and support JongKook at his concert eventhough her fans hated JongKook at that time. And suddenly they just avoid each other like that for a decade.\n\nThat's why I asked you, what is your opinion about that? Maybe you had a better view of why they avoid each other from a neutral fans way.",

Eun Hye agency even said to a media that their staff and Eun Hye herself are interestingly reading the news articles about her being mentioned by Running Man cast. But agency said Running Man never officially invited her. \n\nI don't think Jae Suk stop mentioning her name because Eun Hye side asked him to do. Maybe it's because KJK or Jae Suk himself want to stop doing that. Because Jae Suk also stop pushing Spartace now. Even Eun Hye herself said that she said it's okay to Jae Suk because he keep mentioned her name.",

He looked in pain and annoyed by this loveline and was clearly not into it, and the last of it was when the fans attacked him for not playing it up. Pretty sure he asked everyone to stop doing it then. Which was the episode after they showed up to his house (610). \n\nBTW, he wasn't the only one who was dragged. Poor SoMin didn't do anything and still got hate. I think the show just realized for the first time in years that this one portion of the fanbase is seriously messed up and they should stop catering to them. I'm glad. \n\nNow I want them to please also stop ChanMin, because SoMin is getting dragged in yet another delusional loveline moment like jongkook. (People saying she has feelings for SeChan when she herself and SeChan himself have said multiple times on and off the show that this isn't true.) I blame Sukjin for this one. Why can't we just not have lovelines on running man? The fans are clearly not mature enough to handle them, and they're cringe for the most part any ways.",

Not because they know or do not about the relationship. But because of curiosity. And their behavior is always suspicious.\n\nThat's why Jae Suk once said Eun Hye appeared in every show but not Running Man. Especially Jong Kook in the past so calm when talking about Eun Hye outside of Running Man but acted differently when someone mentioned Eun Hye in Running Man. Of course, everyone will think something going on, and start teasing them. \n\nAnd about Internet Shipper, of course, they will think Jong Kook and Eun Hye were in a relationship before and broke up. Because they avoided each other for no reason. Or did you have any idea why a close friend avoided each other so suddenly?",

Using jokes said on a variety show as your prime proof immediately invalidates your entire argument.\n\nYJS and YEH were also very close friends back then. But until the WSG wannabe project, there was little to no interaction between them. So should we now assume that YJS and YEH were avoiding each other too? Based on your logic, that means they also dated. \n\nI know you want to believe that there\u2019s some drama that happened between KJK and YEH so it\u2019s pointless for me to explain.

And if I'm not mistaken Yoon Eun Hye still appeared in Yoo Jae Suk show to promote her drama right? \n\nFrom what I get after reading about Yoon Eun Hye and her rumored relationship. Only JongKook and GongYoo were two huge celebrities linked with her and had a huge shipper fan base. \n\nFor example , Eun Hye fans always said the reason Eun Hye avoid JongKook was because Eun Hye didn't want to be involved in any dating or relationship rumors again. But she didn't avoid GongYoo eventhough their shipper fanbase is huge than Xman. \n\nSo that means she only cares about her rumors with JongKook and tries her best to avoid that. And the question is why? \n\nThey are close friends in the past. EunHye even begged her fans to stop bashing JongKook in the past and support JongKook at his concert eventhough her fans hated JongKook at that time. And suddenly they just avoid each other like that for a decade.\n\nThat's why I asked you, what is your opinion about that? Maybe you had a better view of why they avoid each other from a neutral fans way.",

Pretty sure he asked everyone to stop doing it then. Which was the episode after they showed up to his house (610). \n\nBTW, he wasn't the only one who was dragged. Poor SoMin didn't do anything and still got hate. I think the show just realized for the first time in years that this one portion of the fanbase is seriously messed up and they should stop catering to them. I'm glad. \n\nNow I want them to please also stop ChanMin, because SoMin is getting dragged in yet another delusional loveline moment like jongkook. (People saying she has feelings for SeChan when she herself and SeChan himself have said multiple times on and off the show that this isn't true.) I blame Sukjin for this one.

Not because they know or do not about the relationship. But because of curiosity. And their behavior is always suspicious.\n\nThat's why Jae Suk once said Eun Hye appeared in every show but not Running Man. Especially Jong Kook in the past so calm when talking about Eun Hye outside of Running Man but acted differently when someone mentioned Eun Hye in Running Man. Of course, everyone will think something going on, and start teasing them. \n\nAnd about Internet Shipper, of course, they will think Jong Kook and Eun Hye were in a relationship before and broke up. Because they avoided each other for no reason. Or did you have any idea why a close friend avoided each other so suddenly?",

Using jokes said on a variety show as your prime proof immediately invalidates your entire argument.\n\nYJS and YEH were also very close friends back then. But until the WSG wannabe project, there was little to no interaction between them. So should we now assume that YJS and YEH were avoiding each other too? Based on your logic, that means they also dated. \n\nI know you want to believe that there\u2019s some drama that happened between KJK and YEH so it\u2019s pointless for me to explain.

And if I'm not mistaken Yoon Eun Hye still appeared in Yoo Jae Suk show to promote her drama right? \n\nFrom what I get after reading about Yoon Eun Hye and her rumored relationship. Only JongKook and GongYoo were two huge celebrities linked with her and had a huge shipper fan base. \n\nFor example , Eun Hye fans always said the reason Eun Hye avoid JongKook was because Eun Hye didn't want to be involved in any dating or relationship rumors again. But she didn't avoid GongYoo eventhough their shipper fanbase is huge than Xman. \n\nSo that means she only cares about her rumors with JongKook and tries her best to avoid that. And the question is why? \n\nThey are close friends in the past. EunHye even begged her fans to stop bashing JongKook in the past and support JongKook at his concert eventhough her fans hated JongKook at that time. And suddenly they just avoid each other like that for a decade.\n\nThat's why I asked you, what is your opinion about that? Maybe you had a better view of why they avoid each other from a neutral fans way.",

Pretty sure he asked everyone to stop doing it then. Which was the episode after they showed up to his house (610). \n\nBTW, he wasn't the only one who was dragged. Poor SoMin didn't do anything and still got hate. I think the show just realized for the first time in years that this one portion of the fanbase is seriously messed up and they should stop catering to them. I'm glad. \n\nNow I want them to please also stop ChanMin, because SoMin is getting dragged in yet another delusional loveline moment like jongkook. (People saying she has feelings for SeChan when she herself and SeChan himself have said multiple times on and off the show that this isn't true.) I blame Sukjin for this one.

Not because they know or do not about the relationship. But because of curiosity.

Of course, everyone will think something going on, and start teasing them. \n\nAnd about Internet Shipper, of course, they will think Jong Kook and Eun Hye were in a relationship before and broke up. Because they avoided each other for no reason. Or did you have any idea why a close friend avoided each other so suddenly?",

And if I'm not mistaken Yoon Eun Hye still appeared in Yoo Jae Suk show to promote her drama right? \n\nFrom what I get after reading about Yoon Eun Hye and her rumored relationship. Only JongKook and GongYoo were two huge celebrities linked with her and had a huge shipper fan base. \n\nFor example , Eun Hye fans always said the reason Eun Hye avoid JongKook was because Eun Hye didn't want to be involved in any dating or relationship rumors again. But she didn't avoid GongYoo eventhough their shipper fanbase is huge than Xman. \n\nSo that means she only cares about her rumors with JongKook and tries her best to avoid that. And the question is why? \n\nThey are close friends in the past. EunHye even begged her fans to stop bashing JongKook in the past and support JongKook at his concert eventhough her fans hated JongKook at that time. And suddenly they just avoid each other like that for a decade.\n\nThat's why I asked you, what is your opinion about that? Maybe you had a better view of why they avoid each other from a neutral fans way.",
