While Naruto I was able to read the whole Manga twice without getting bored and I'm planning to do it again.

It seems that you went into AoT expecting it to be bad and then fulfilled your prophecy. AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

It seems that you went into AoT expecting it to be bad and then fulfilled your prophecy. AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

I went in thinking it was good but was completely disappointed that S1 sucked IMO. I gave up after watching a few episodes from S2. My point was that it's an opinion thing. Kishimoto is not a bad writer if I was able to enjoy Naruto a lot while but comparison I did not like AoT. Everyone is open to their own opinion is my point",

It seems that you went into AoT expecting it to be bad and then fulfilled your prophecy. AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

While Naruto I was able to read the whole Manga twice without getting bored and I'm planning to do it again.

It seems that you went into AoT expecting it to be bad and then fulfilled your prophecy. AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

That can be understandable, if Minato and Kushina were even in the same stratosphere as Kurama in terms of physical strength. \n\nEven with a full chakra supply, and allowing them the ability to dump all their chakra into one attack, I'm sure they wouldn't be able to replicate what Kurama could do with a single swing.\n\nYou can definitely say I'm hinging onto this too much, though I don't think I am since this is a minor thought that this post just happened to bring out, not something that really bothers me.\n\nThat reason is way too vague and can be fit anywhere for convenience sake, so I simply cannot accept it.

AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

That can be understandable, if Minato and Kushina were even in the same stratosphere as Kurama in terms of physical strength. \n\nEven with a full chakra supply, and allowing them the ability to dump all their chakra into one attack, I'm sure they wouldn't be able to replicate what Kurama could do with a single swing.\n\nYou can definitely say I'm hinging onto this too much, though I don't think I am since this is a minor thought that this post just happened to bring out, not something that really bothers me.\n\nThat reason is way too vague and can be fit anywhere for convenience sake, so I simply cannot accept it.

While Naruto I was able to read the whole Manga twice without getting bored and I'm planning to do it again. The characters are memorable and fun with interesting abilities but IMO AoT is the opposite",

AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

Even if they are the type to rely on techniques, they still physically strong.\n\nBut there's no reason to get into that lol, like you said it's just a minor thought so if you disagree lets' just drop it.",

AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",

AoT is, in general, a mystery show with shonen elements so it\u2019s set up in a way that is meant to be vague in the beginning and open up as more episodes go on. Idk I enjoyed both series but saying AoT is boring at the beginning after the first two episode hook and then quitting before the characters are even developed seems kinda disingenuous in the way you watched the show.",
