I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

Just like sexuality and gender are separate concepts.\n\nThis thread is stupid. This \"argument\" was stupid. And you have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old. You might actually be 5 years old though, so I'll refrain from calling you stupid.",

We're talking about Sakura. \n\nYou can probably handwave Sasuke for having some kind of freudian excuse to be a murderous sociopath that hell bent on revenge, or being an absentee father and husband for that matter. That's not the same for Sakura being in love with Sasuke though. \n\nHe treated her like shit even before he left Konoha. He was sick enough to tell her to kill a defenseless, half-dead Karin just so she can pledge loyalty. He tried to destroy the world. Yet, Sakura forgives all of that just because he said sorry and touch her forehead?\n\nI don't know about you, but I don't think any sane person could love someone like Sasuke the way Sakura does, no matter how sympathetic the story make the character looks. Her character arc would've been much better if it've lead to her *getting over* Sasuke instead of marrying him. It also doesn't help that it isn't even very clear why Sakura fell in love with Sasuke in the first place other than that he's hot, because unlike Sasuke with Naruto, they almost literally never interact. Other than they were on the same team, they feel almost like total strangers.",

That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries.

So I really think that there's nothing wrong with Karin being so obsessed with Sasuke, and I also think that Karin is a really well written character and her behaviour is justified by the fact that she was assaulted and oppresed as a kid since such behavioural traits are common in such kids.",

But still Kishimoto made her way too creepy by making her literally lusting over Sasuke's body whole day. He could have developed her praise/love for Sasuke in a positive way instead of using her lusting over Sasuke as a comedic tool in the story. Unfortunately, you are paying more attention to Karin's character and traumatic childhood than Kishimoto himself did. Also, I think after she said \"Why should I care for Sasuke\" after he almost killed her, he should have sided with the leaf. It would have made her character more likeable and relatable too. But yeah I will give it to you that she is better than Sakura. Sakura had a pretty good childhood so she had no reason or business being so obsessed with Sasuke.",

To sasuke his whole existence was to kill itachi and restore his clan anything else didn\u2019t matter at all and he made that decision as a kid. Now I know itachi and naruto helped sasuke choose a better path but all the trauma and stuff he went through just doesn\u2019t go away, sasuke definitely wouldn\u2019t have an interest in anyone romantically. As you said kishi just made sasuke impregnate the female lead so naruto\u2019s kid could have an uchiha buddy.",

When he calls her annoying each of those 3 times, it\u2019s for different reasons. \n\nFirst time it\u2019s because she was annoying. Second time was just him showing her that he lied before and he did remember that first memory also he literally thanks her for loving him. The third time is him being annoyed that she\u2019s trying to shake up his resolve. \n\nIt has nothing to do with Sasuke finding Sakura repulsive or something after the first time.",

Sasuke was the first person to acknowledge Naruto from his own age group (class) and knowing Naruto's childhood it was a very big thing for him. He never had any friend in his age group before that. Sakura on the other hand had a good childhood and also had friends like Ino. There was no reason for her to follow Sasuke this much. Then there is the fact that as the series progressed Naruto's reasons kept becoming stronger and stronger because he wanted to break Pain's cycle of hatred as he promised he would to Nagato, Jiraiya and Minato too and he also wanted to change the cycle of hatred between Indra and Ashura after hearing Hagoromo's story. Sakura's reasoning didnt progress at all. Also, Naruto knew about Itachi's truth too and he also made a promise to protect Sasuke to Itachi too. Plus, Naruto was ready to fight Sasuke to make him change unlike Sakura who just begged and cried in front of him. I do understand that Sakura wasn't strong like Naruto to take on Sasuke but atleast she could have gathered a bit more resolve and not cry and beg like a servant in front of a criminal.",

I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

How the flying fuck are you interpreting their nonsense sentence as saying that \"sexuality has pronouns\"? You're not wrong about \"gay... he/him\", but it's completely irrelevant. This entire thread has focused on Tenten's obsession with weapon scrolls and her lack of screen time given (I assume) by Masashi Kishimoto. Separate. Unrelated. Concepts. Just like sexuality and gender are separate concepts.\n\nThis thread is stupid. This \"argument\" was stupid. And you have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old. You might actually be 5 years old though, so I'll refrain from calling you stupid.",

We're talking about Sakura. \n\nYou can probably handwave Sasuke for having some kind of freudian excuse to be a murderous sociopath that hell bent on revenge, or being an absentee father and husband for that matter. That's not the same for Sakura being in love with Sasuke though. \n\nHe treated her like shit even before he left Konoha. He was sick enough to tell her to kill a defenseless, half-dead Karin just so she can pledge loyalty. He tried to destroy the world. Yet, Sakura forgives all of that just because he said sorry and touch her forehead?\n\nI don't know about you, but I don't think any sane person could love someone like Sasuke the way Sakura does, no matter how sympathetic the story make the character looks. Her character arc would've been much better if it've lead to her *getting over* Sasuke instead of marrying him. It also doesn't help that it isn't even very clear why Sakura fell in love with Sasuke in the first place other than that he's hot, because unlike Sasuke with Naruto, they almost literally never interact. Other than they were on the same team, they feel almost like total strangers.",

Suigetsu actually called him soft since he didn't want to kill any of Orochimaru's prisoners.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the cloud did exactly the same thing Sasuke did to them but twice.\n\nFirst with Kushina and then with Hinata and since A knew who Naruto was Minato and Kushina's son, they must have been planning on capturing him as a kid but a good opportunity never presented itself.\n\nIf all that can be forgiven then it's nothing in comparison for Sakura to forgive Sasuke.\n\nOh and Itachi said Sasuke didn't have to forgive him but clearly Sasuke already had. That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries. The Akatsuki just took it a step up.\n\nIf it were more realistic plotwise, Sakura and Naruto would have killed other shinobi and their siblings / parents would either seek revenge or choose to forgive them.\n\n> I'm not sure how the Sakura lying to Naruto bit relates to the discussion, but if it's to point out how stupid Sakura is as a character who thinks her two teammates conflict revolves around her, then I agree with you.\n\nI was trolling a little bit because I've had several Sakura haters tell me they hate scene but I think it's great, not because I personally like Sakura but because heavy emotional scenes are a big part of what makes a shonen good or not.",

So I really think that there's nothing wrong with Karin being so obsessed with Sasuke, and I also think that Karin is a really well written character and her behaviour is justified by the fact that she was assaulted and oppresed as a kid since such behavioural traits are common in such kids.",

But still Kishimoto made her way too creepy by making her literally lusting over Sasuke's body whole day. He could have developed her praise/love for Sasuke in a positive way instead of using her lusting over Sasuke as a comedic tool in the story. Unfortunately, you are paying more attention to Karin's character and traumatic childhood than Kishimoto himself did. Also, I think after she said \"Why should I care for Sasuke\" after he almost killed her, he should have sided with the leaf. It would have made her character more likeable and relatable too. But yeah I will give it to you that she is better than Sakura. Sakura had a pretty good childhood so she had no reason or business being so obsessed with Sasuke.",

For the simple fact that they were teammates/friends they shared a \"bond\" and that's why they married each other. Kishi fucked up lol",

To sasuke his whole existence was to kill itachi and restore his clan anything else didn\u2019t matter at all and he made that decision as a kid. Now I know itachi and naruto helped sasuke choose a better path but all the trauma and stuff he went through just doesn\u2019t go away, sasuke definitely wouldn\u2019t have an interest in anyone romantically. As you said kishi just made sasuke impregnate the female lead so naruto\u2019s kid could have an uchiha buddy.",

When he calls her annoying each of those 3 times, it\u2019s for different reasons. \n\nFirst time it\u2019s because she was annoying. Second time was just him showing her that he lied before and he did remember that first memory also he literally thanks her for loving him. The third time is him being annoyed that she\u2019s trying to shake up his resolve. \n\nIt has nothing to do with Sasuke finding Sakura repulsive or something after the first time.",

It only makes it your destiny to fight and kill the Indra reincarnation. Naruto got stronger through his own efforts except the powers given by the Sage of Six Paths to him in the War Arc. Sage Mode and KCM were attained through his own efforts. And he also changed his destiny by not killing Sasuke and breaking the cycle of hatred. Naruto wasnt supposed to be an underdog in terms of skills and strength. His character was about overcoming hatred. I would recommend you a video called \"I was wrong about Naruto\" by Masked Man.

Sasuke was the first person to acknowledge Naruto from his own age group (class) and knowing Naruto's childhood it was a very big thing for him. He never had any friend in his age group before that. Sakura on the other hand had a good childhood and also had friends like Ino. There was no reason for her to follow Sasuke this much. Then there is the fact that as the series progressed Naruto's reasons kept becoming stronger and stronger because he wanted to break Pain's cycle of hatred as he promised he would to Nagato, Jiraiya and Minato too and he also wanted to change the cycle of hatred between Indra and Ashura after hearing Hagoromo's story. Sakura's reasoning didnt progress at all. Also, Naruto knew about Itachi's truth too and he also made a promise to protect Sasuke to Itachi too. Plus, Naruto was ready to fight Sasuke to make him change unlike Sakura who just begged and cried in front of him. I do understand that Sakura wasn't strong like Naruto to take on Sasuke but atleast she could have gathered a bit more resolve and not cry and beg like a servant in front of a criminal.",

I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

Just like sexuality and gender are separate concepts.\n\nThis thread is stupid. This \"argument\" was stupid. And you have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old. You might actually be 5 years old though, so I'll refrain from calling you stupid.",

That's not the same for Sakura being in love with Sasuke though. \n\nHe treated her like shit even before he left Konoha. He was sick enough to tell her to kill a defenseless, half-dead Karin just so she can pledge loyalty. He tried to destroy the world. Yet, Sakura forgives all of that just because he said sorry and touch her forehead?\n\nI don't know about you, but I don't think any sane person could love someone like Sasuke the way Sakura does, no matter how sympathetic the story make the character looks. Her character arc would've been much better if it've lead to her *getting over* Sasuke instead of marrying him. It also doesn't help that it isn't even very clear why Sakura fell in love with Sasuke in the first place other than that he's hot, because unlike Sasuke with Naruto, they almost literally never interact. Other than they were on the same team, they feel almost like total strangers.",

Suigetsu actually called him soft since he didn't want to kill any of Orochimaru's prisoners.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the cloud did exactly the same thing Sasuke did to them but twice.\n\nFirst with Kushina and then with Hinata and since A knew who Naruto was Minato and Kushina's son, they must have been planning on capturing him as a kid but a good opportunity never presented itself.\n\nIf all that can be forgiven then it's nothing in comparison for Sakura to forgive Sasuke.\n\nOh and Itachi said Sasuke didn't have to forgive him but clearly Sasuke already had. That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries. The Akatsuki just took it a step up.\n\nIf it were more realistic plotwise, Sakura and Naruto would have killed other shinobi and their siblings / parents would either seek revenge or choose to forgive them.\n\n> I'm not sure how the Sakura lying to Naruto bit relates to the discussion, but if it's to point out how stupid Sakura is as a character who thinks her two teammates conflict revolves around her, then I agree with you.\n\nI was trolling a little bit because I've had several Sakura haters tell me they hate scene but I think it's great, not because I personally like Sakura but because heavy emotional scenes are a big part of what makes a shonen good or not.",

He could have developed her praise/love for Sasuke in a positive way instead of using her lusting over Sasuke as a comedic tool in the story. Unfortunately, you are paying more attention to Karin's character and traumatic childhood than Kishimoto himself did. Also, I think after she said \"Why should I care for Sasuke\" after he almost killed her, he should have sided with the leaf. It would have made her character more likeable and relatable too. But yeah I will give it to you that she is better than Sakura. Sakura had a pretty good childhood so she had no reason or business being so obsessed with Sasuke.",

To sasuke his whole existence was to kill itachi and restore his clan anything else didn\u2019t matter at all and he made that decision as a kid. Now I know itachi and naruto helped sasuke choose a better path but all the trauma and stuff he went through just doesn\u2019t go away, sasuke definitely wouldn\u2019t have an interest in anyone romantically. As you said kishi just made sasuke impregnate the female lead so naruto\u2019s kid could have an uchiha buddy.",

When he calls her annoying each of those 3 times, it\u2019s for different reasons. \n\nFirst time it\u2019s because she was annoying. Second time was just him showing her that he lied before and he did remember that first memory also he literally thanks her for loving him. The third time is him being annoyed that she\u2019s trying to shake up his resolve. \n\nIt has nothing to do with Sasuke finding Sakura repulsive or something after the first time.",

It only makes it your destiny to fight and kill the Indra reincarnation. Naruto got stronger through his own efforts except the powers given by the Sage of Six Paths to him in the War Arc. Sage Mode and KCM were attained through his own efforts. And he also changed his destiny by not killing Sasuke and breaking the cycle of hatred. Naruto wasnt supposed to be an underdog in terms of skills and strength. His character was about overcoming hatred. I would recommend you a video called \"I was wrong about Naruto\" by Masked Man.

Sasuke was the first person to acknowledge Naruto from his own age group (class) and knowing Naruto's childhood it was a very big thing for him. He never had any friend in his age group before that. Sakura on the other hand had a good childhood and also had friends like Ino. There was no reason for her to follow Sasuke this much. Then there is the fact that as the series progressed Naruto's reasons kept becoming stronger and stronger because he wanted to break Pain's cycle of hatred as he promised he would to Nagato, Jiraiya and Minato too and he also wanted to change the cycle of hatred between Indra and Ashura after hearing Hagoromo's story. Sakura's reasoning didnt progress at all. Also, Naruto knew about Itachi's truth too and he also made a promise to protect Sasuke to Itachi too. Plus, Naruto was ready to fight Sasuke to make him change unlike Sakura who just begged and cried in front of him. I do understand that Sakura wasn't strong like Naruto to take on Sasuke but atleast she could have gathered a bit more resolve and not cry and beg like a servant in front of a criminal.",

I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

Just like sexuality and gender are separate concepts.\n\nThis thread is stupid. This \"argument\" was stupid. And you have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old. You might actually be 5 years old though, so I'll refrain from calling you stupid.",

That's not the same for Sakura being in love with Sasuke though. \n\nHe treated her like shit even before he left Konoha. He was sick enough to tell her to kill a defenseless, half-dead Karin just so she can pledge loyalty. He tried to destroy the world. Yet, Sakura forgives all of that just because he said sorry and touch her forehead?\n\nI don't know about you, but I don't think any sane person could love someone like Sasuke the way Sakura does, no matter how sympathetic the story make the character looks. Her character arc would've been much better if it've lead to her *getting over* Sasuke instead of marrying him. It also doesn't help that it isn't even very clear why Sakura fell in love with Sasuke in the first place other than that he's hot, because unlike Sasuke with Naruto, they almost literally never interact.

That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries. The Akatsuki just took it a step up.\n\nIf it were more realistic plotwise, Sakura and Naruto would have killed other shinobi and their siblings / parents would either seek revenge or choose to forgive them.\n\n> I'm not sure how the Sakura lying to Naruto bit relates to the discussion, but if it's to point out how stupid Sakura is as a character who thinks her two teammates conflict revolves around her, then I agree with you.\n\nI was trolling a little bit because I've had several Sakura haters tell me they hate scene but I think it's great, not because I personally like Sakura but because heavy emotional scenes are a big part of what makes a shonen good or not.",

So I really think that there's nothing wrong with Karin being so obsessed with Sasuke, and I also think that Karin is a really well written character and her behaviour is justified by the fact that she was assaulted and oppresed as a kid since such behavioural traits are common in such kids.",

He could have developed her praise/love for Sasuke in a positive way instead of using her lusting over Sasuke as a comedic tool in the story. Unfortunately, you are paying more attention to Karin's character and traumatic childhood than Kishimoto himself did. Also, I think after she said \"Why should I care for Sasuke\" after he almost killed her, he should have sided with the leaf. It would have made her character more likeable and relatable too. But yeah I will give it to you that she is better than Sakura. Sakura had a pretty good childhood so she had no reason or business being so obsessed with Sasuke.",

Ino could also be a medic, and even if she weren't able to use the Yin seal, could integrate the fighting style of Tsunade to make a highly lethal one where she could damage the psyche itself.

Sasuke was the first person to acknowledge Naruto from his own age group (class) and knowing Naruto's childhood it was a very big thing for him. He never had any friend in his age group before that. Sakura on the other hand had a good childhood and also had friends like Ino. There was no reason for her to follow Sasuke this much. Then there is the fact that as the series progressed Naruto's reasons kept becoming stronger and stronger because he wanted to break Pain's cycle of hatred as he promised he would to Nagato, Jiraiya and Minato too and he also wanted to change the cycle of hatred between Indra and Ashura after hearing Hagoromo's story. Sakura's reasoning didnt progress at all. Also, Naruto knew about Itachi's truth too and he also made a promise to protect Sasuke to Itachi too. Plus, Naruto was ready to fight Sasuke to make him change unlike Sakura who just begged and cried in front of him. I do understand that Sakura wasn't strong like Naruto to take on Sasuke but atleast she could have gathered a bit more resolve and not cry and beg like a servant in front of a criminal.",

I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries.

But still Kishimoto made her way too creepy by making her literally lusting over Sasuke's body whole day. He could have developed her praise/love for Sasuke in a positive way instead of using her lusting over Sasuke as a comedic tool in the story. Unfortunately, you are paying more attention to Karin's character and traumatic childhood than Kishimoto himself did. Also, I think after she said \"Why should I care for Sasuke\" after he almost killed her, he should have sided with the leaf. It would have made her character more likeable and relatable too. But yeah I will give it to you that she is better than Sakura. Sakura had a pretty good childhood so she had no reason or business being so obsessed with Sasuke.",

For the simple fact that they were teammates/friends they shared a \"bond\" and that's why they married each other. Kishi fucked up lol",

To sasuke his whole existence was to kill itachi and restore his clan anything else didn\u2019t matter at all and he made that decision as a kid. Now I know itachi and naruto helped sasuke choose a better path but all the trauma and stuff he went through just doesn\u2019t go away, sasuke definitely wouldn\u2019t have an interest in anyone romantically. As you said kishi just made sasuke impregnate the female lead so naruto\u2019s kid could have an uchiha buddy.",

Ino could also be a medic, and even if she weren't able to use the Yin seal, could integrate the fighting style of Tsunade to make a highly lethal one where she could damage the psyche itself.

I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

Naruto, being as blunt and forward as every protagonist, stated very clearly what he wanted and Sasuke was shy. He hadn\u2019t accepted himself for who he is so he ran away from his problems. He came back to take up Narutos Offer of bottoming. He realised that Naruto was radiating Big Dick Energy after his actions in the War. \n\nNaruto learnt the girl transformation to spy or in an attempt to be a lesbian with Sakura which ended up actually being Hinata.",

This entire thread has focused on Tenten's obsession with weapon scrolls and her lack of screen time given (I assume) by Masashi Kishimoto. Separate. Unrelated. Concepts. Just like sexuality and gender are separate concepts.\n\nThis thread is stupid. This \"argument\" was stupid. And you have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old. You might actually be 5 years old though, so I'll refrain from calling you stupid.",

Suigetsu actually called him soft since he didn't want to kill any of Orochimaru's prisoners.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the cloud did exactly the same thing Sasuke did to them but twice.\n\nFirst with Kushina and then with Hinata and since A knew who Naruto was Minato and Kushina's son, they must have been planning on capturing him as a kid but a good opportunity never presented itself.\n\nIf all that can be forgiven then it's nothing in comparison for Sakura to forgive Sasuke.\n\nOh and Itachi said Sasuke didn't have to forgive him but clearly Sasuke already had. That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries. The Akatsuki just took it a step up.\n\nIf it were more realistic plotwise, Sakura and Naruto would have killed other shinobi and their siblings / parents would either seek revenge or choose to forgive them.\n\n> I'm not sure how the Sakura lying to Naruto bit relates to the discussion, but if it's to point out how stupid Sakura is as a character who thinks her two teammates conflict revolves around her, then I agree with you.\n\nI was trolling a little bit because I've had several Sakura haters tell me they hate scene but I think it's great, not because I personally like Sakura but because heavy emotional scenes are a big part of what makes a shonen good or not.",

Ino could also be a medic, and even if she weren't able to use the Yin seal, could integrate the fighting style of Tsunade to make a highly lethal one where she could damage the psyche itself. Her control was due to small reserves at the beginning, and she maintained the control due to constantly practicing medic chakra usage, which required chakra control of a high calibre. Before Tsunade started training her, she was the weakest in the Rookie 9 in an actual fight and not a full on battle.",

Not to mention, Jiraiya didn't even know their techniques going in.\n\nAnd I'm thinking that Sakura has matched or surpassed Tsunade now.\n\nCan't really compare to Naruto's sage mode though because it wasn't really clear from the war to me.",

I can't keep track of all or Kishimoto's childhood retcons... but one would think that at least Hinata would've moved over that, specially considering her relationship to Neji and mending all the Hyuga family drama. \n\nOne of the reasons Naruto noticed Hinata as a love interest was mainly because she showed that she really cared and was able to stand up for herself.\n\nWhich doesn't sounds like something Sasuke wpuld be attracted to...\n\nAnd tbh Sasuke is either ace or demisexual, he basically loves Naruto but clapped Sakura out of duty and because she's probably the only other bond he has besides Naruto (maybe Kakashi too, since mentorship relationships are shown to be quite close and intense in this series).\n\nThat makes 1000% more sense than SasukexHinata",

Naruto, being as blunt and forward as every protagonist, stated very clearly what he wanted and Sasuke was shy. He hadn\u2019t accepted himself for who he is so he ran away from his problems. He came back to take up Narutos Offer of bottoming. He realised that Naruto was radiating Big Dick Energy after his actions in the War. \n\nNaruto learnt the girl transformation to spy or in an attempt to be a lesbian with Sakura which ended up actually being Hinata.",

Suigetsu actually called him soft since he didn't want to kill any of Orochimaru's prisoners.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the cloud did exactly the same thing Sasuke did to them but twice.\n\nFirst with Kushina and then with Hinata and since A knew who Naruto was Minato and Kushina's son, they must have been planning on capturing him as a kid but a good opportunity never presented itself.\n\nIf all that can be forgiven then it's nothing in comparison for Sakura to forgive Sasuke.\n\nOh and Itachi said Sasuke didn't have to forgive him but clearly Sasuke already had. That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries. The Akatsuki just took it a step up.\n\nIf it were more realistic plotwise, Sakura and Naruto would have killed other shinobi and their siblings / parents would either seek revenge or choose to forgive them.\n\n> I'm not sure how the Sakura lying to Naruto bit relates to the discussion, but if it's to point out how stupid Sakura is as a character who thinks her two teammates conflict revolves around her, then I agree with you.\n\nI was trolling a little bit because I've had several Sakura haters tell me they hate scene but I think it's great, not because I personally like Sakura but because heavy emotional scenes are a big part of what makes a shonen good or not.",

Ino could also be a medic, and even if she weren't able to use the Yin seal, could integrate the fighting style of Tsunade to make a highly lethal one where she could damage the psyche itself. Her control was due to small reserves at the beginning, and she maintained the control due to constantly practicing medic chakra usage, which required chakra control of a high calibre. Before Tsunade started training her, she was the weakest in the Rookie 9 in an actual fight and not a full on battle.",

Maybe fire style for a masochist but meh....",

Suigetsu actually called him soft since he didn't want to kill any of Orochimaru's prisoners.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the cloud did exactly the same thing Sasuke did to them but twice.\n\nFirst with Kushina and then with Hinata and since A knew who Naruto was Minato and Kushina's son, they must have been planning on capturing him as a kid but a good opportunity never presented itself.\n\nIf all that can be forgiven then it's nothing in comparison for Sakura to forgive Sasuke.\n\nOh and Itachi said Sasuke didn't have to forgive him but clearly Sasuke already had. That's way heavier than Sakura forgiving Sasuke.\n\nDo you think Sasuke shouldn't have forgiven Itachi?\n\nThe show is way generous with not killing actually. Sakura and Naruto never kill anyone to my knowledge despite the villages being mercenary militaries. The Akatsuki just took it a step up.\n\nIf it were more realistic plotwise, Sakura and Naruto would have killed other shinobi and their siblings / parents would either seek revenge or choose to forgive them.\n\n> I'm not sure how the Sakura lying to Naruto bit relates to the discussion, but if it's to point out how stupid Sakura is as a character who thinks her two teammates conflict revolves around her, then I agree with you.\n\nI was trolling a little bit because I've had several Sakura haters tell me they hate scene but I think it's great, not because I personally like Sakura but because heavy emotional scenes are a big part of what makes a shonen good or not.",

Like, what are you even saying right now?\n\n>Before Tsunade started training her, she was the weakest in the Rookie 9 in an actual fight and not a full on battle.\n\nYes that was part of her whole character arc.

Studies have shown their brains work differently than other cis people.\n\nYou\u2019re not making any sense and you don\u2019t even understand how pronouns work.
