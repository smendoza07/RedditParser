Right after he got his Kcm2, he gave his chakra to ALL of the remaining shinobi left on the battlefield.

Basically when he was So6P with the tailed beast chakras he was the strongest user of every element he had because of that lol\n\nDanzo has a good amount of amazing wind style techniques and he was the only one to show a strong variety of uses of wind style and its not nearly enough to put him near Naruto.\n\nBesides that we have Baki that can use it to create wind blades, asuma that basically does the same as baki, Temari that blows wind with her fan. Also there's Shukaku if you want to count tailed beasts. Ah and Kakuzo can create a explosion like a minor minor rasen shuriken.",

Then Naruto was heavily damaged through his Chakra cloth while he had acces to the full extent of the kyubi Chakra and rendered useless, while sarada had activated her lvl 1 sharingan and destroid those clones. 20 - 30 years earlier, with only a fraction of the kyubi Chakra, while having 12 years, Naruto healed his whole shoulder destroyed by Sasuke, and probably part of his lung, and the red Chakra protected him against pretty much anything except a full force chidori. In the war he created an eye for Kakashi and basically a whole body for Guy. Not to say that in the war he was faster then raikage, probably close to the 4th hokage speed and had also incredible good sensory abilities due to the sage mode, and now he is hit by surprize by an object controlled with Chakra.. This is only an example of Naruto nerfs, Sasuke is not far with him being able to do a teleportetion jutsu and then run our of Chakra. While before obtaining eternal mongekyo sharingan he fought raikage, mizukage, after which he had gone directly to confront danzo (presumably another kage-lever character, the rival of the 3rd) and he defeated him like 10 times (because he could modify reality) while using amateratsu, susanoo, tsukuyomi, multiple times and at the very least he run out of fuel.

He was able to do other transformations when he got Six Paths because that sage mode gives you almost omnipotent knowledge of chakra. This is probably why he can also use just one hand since he now knows how to manipulate his chakra efficiently. The Six Path Sage Mode most definitely made him physically stronger too as he was pretty much able to 1 shot Juubi Madara in base. Also, We only learned that he could throw it when he used it against the Third Raikage.\n\nSide note: the war was the Fourth Great Ninja War/Fourth Shinobi World War\n\nEdit: \u201c1 shot Juubi Madara\u201d was autocorrected to \u201c1 shit Juubi Madara\u201d\n\nEdit 2: checkout Reldorn\u2019s reply as he mentioned something I forgot",

Then Naruto got the acceptance and the rest of Kurama\u2019s chakra, the chakra of the other tailed beasts, and Six Path Sage Mode. Right after he got his Kcm2, he gave his chakra to ALL of the remaining shinobi left on the battlefield. We also gotta keep in mind this Naruto who progressively got stronger fought against Obito and 6 Jinchuriki, Juubi Obito, Madara, Juubi Madara, Kaguya, and then Sasuke. All without rest. Then comes in adult Naruto who would\u2019ve trained since then and can\u2019t even spare the chakra of 1 clone for his family.",

Then Naruto was heavily damaged through his Chakra cloth while he had acces to the full extent of the kyubi Chakra and rendered useless, while sarada had activated her lvl 1 sharingan and destroid those clones. 20 - 30 years earlier, with only a fraction of the kyubi Chakra, while having 12 years, Naruto healed his whole shoulder destroyed by Sasuke, and probably part of his lung, and the red Chakra protected him against pretty much anything except a full force chidori. In the war he created an eye for Kakashi and basically a whole body for Guy. Not to say that in the war he was faster then raikage, probably close to the 4th hokage speed and had also incredible good sensory abilities due to the sage mode, and now he is hit by surprize by an object controlled with Chakra.. This is only an example of Naruto nerfs, Sasuke is not far with him being able to do a teleportetion jutsu and then run our of Chakra. While before obtaining eternal mongekyo sharingan he fought raikage, mizukage, after which he had gone directly to confront danzo (presumably another kage-lever character, the rival of the 3rd) and he defeated him like 10 times (because he could modify reality) while using amateratsu, susanoo, tsukuyomi, multiple times and at the very least he run out of fuel. In the war arc he should have even greater Chakra",

He was able to do other transformations when he got Six Paths because that sage mode gives you almost omnipotent knowledge of chakra.

The Six Path Sage Mode most definitely made him physically stronger too as he was pretty much able to 1 shot Juubi Madara in base. Also, We only learned that he could throw it when he used it against the Third Raikage.\n\nSide note: the war was the Fourth Great Ninja War/Fourth Shinobi World War\n\nEdit: \u201c1 shot Juubi Madara\u201d was autocorrected to \u201c1 shit Juubi Madara\u201d\n\nEdit 2: checkout Reldorn\u2019s reply as he mentioned something I forgot",

Then Naruto was heavily damaged through his Chakra cloth while he had acces to the full extent of the kyubi Chakra and rendered useless, while sarada had activated her lvl 1 sharingan and destroid those clones. 20 - 30 years earlier, with only a fraction of the kyubi Chakra, while having 12 years, Naruto healed his whole shoulder destroyed by Sasuke, and probably part of his lung, and the red Chakra protected him against pretty much anything except a full force chidori. In the war he created an eye for Kakashi and basically a whole body for Guy. Not to say that in the war he was faster then raikage, probably close to the 4th hokage speed and had also incredible good sensory abilities due to the sage mode, and now he is hit by surprize by an object controlled with Chakra.. This is only an example of Naruto nerfs, Sasuke is not far with him being able to do a teleportetion jutsu and then run our of Chakra. While before obtaining eternal mongekyo sharingan he fought raikage, mizukage, after which he had gone directly to confront danzo (presumably another kage-lever character, the rival of the 3rd) and he defeated him like 10 times (because he could modify reality) while using amateratsu, susanoo, tsukuyomi, multiple times and at the very least he run out of fuel. In the war arc he should have even greater Chakra",

The Six Path Sage Mode most definitely made him physically stronger too as he was pretty much able to 1 shot Juubi Madara in base.

In the war he created an eye for Kakashi and basically a whole body for Guy. Not to say that in the war he was faster then raikage, probably close to the 4th hokage speed and had also incredible good sensory abilities due to the sage mode, and now he is hit by surprize by an object controlled with Chakra.. This is only an example of Naruto nerfs, Sasuke is not far with him being able to do a teleportetion jutsu and then run our of Chakra. While before obtaining eternal mongekyo sharingan he fought raikage, mizukage, after which he had gone directly to confront danzo (presumably another kage-lever character, the rival of the 3rd) and he defeated him like 10 times (because he could modify reality) while using amateratsu, susanoo, tsukuyomi, multiple times and at the very least he run out of fuel. In the war arc he should have even greater Chakra",

In the war he created an eye for Kakashi and basically a whole body for Guy. Not to say that in the war he was faster then raikage, probably close to the 4th hokage speed and had also incredible good sensory abilities due to the sage mode, and now he is hit by surprize by an object controlled with Chakra.. This is only an example of Naruto nerfs, Sasuke is not far with him being able to do a teleportetion jutsu and then run our of Chakra. While before obtaining eternal mongekyo sharingan he fought raikage, mizukage, after which he had gone directly to confront danzo (presumably another kage-lever character, the rival of the 3rd) and he defeated him like 10 times (because he could modify reality) while using amateratsu, susanoo, tsukuyomi, multiple times and at the very least he run out of fuel.

Then Naruto got the acceptance and the rest of Kurama\u2019s chakra, the chakra of the other tailed beasts, and Six Path Sage Mode. Right after he got his Kcm2, he gave his chakra to ALL of the remaining shinobi left on the battlefield. We also gotta keep in mind this Naruto who progressively got stronger fought against Obito and 6 Jinchuriki, Juubi Obito, Madara, Juubi Madara, Kaguya, and then Sasuke. All without rest. Then comes in adult Naruto who would\u2019ve trained since then and can\u2019t even spare the chakra of 1 clone for his family.",
