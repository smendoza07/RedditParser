So he can't really use it any given time. But itachi's sickness and all came out of nowhere, i still feel it was mostly done to win more sympathy points and partially so that it would be easier to justify him struggling during the fight.",

So he can't really use it any given time. But itachi's sickness and all came out of nowhere, i still feel it was mostly done to win more sympathy points and partially so that it would be easier to justify him struggling during the fight.",

He could beat Gaara and Onoki 1 on 1, but those two in long range with any of the two taijutsu kage would be an issue. Mei seems like she\u2019s the weakest, but only when she\u2019s facing an invincible god in Madara. She\u2019s still insanely powerful in her own right, but Itachi could probably easily solo her.",
