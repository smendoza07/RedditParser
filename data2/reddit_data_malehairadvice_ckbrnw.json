Once I'm out I towel dry, apply Marc Anthony argan oil cream and sea salt spray,  and then use a super wide toothed comb to put in the direction I want, while also combing it upwards so I'll have some volume, then I let it air dry for about an hour, after an hour it will be dry and hard, so I run my hands through it a few times, then it softens up and I get a super easy, almost no real work quiff that's super easy to replicate everyday.",
