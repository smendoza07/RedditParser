    "body": "I don\u2019t see myself ever really being so financially sufficient I have loads to spare.  But if I could, I\u2019d totally be a sugar mama. I think it\u2019d be really fun and cute to have a sophomore or junior in college who depends on me for support and mentor ship. I would steer them towards a good path and give them ample space. And we\u2019d meet up and have sex in front of mirrors and he\u2019d fall for me and I\u2019d have to gently say, sorry Andrew. We could never be. I care for you deeply but I won\u2019t leave my husband for you. Now please, meet me in the pool house. \nThe idea is very intriguing to me. \nHas anyone else ever fantasized about being on the other side?",
