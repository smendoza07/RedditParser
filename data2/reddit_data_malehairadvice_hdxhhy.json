Did you do this yourself? You have a few options: \n\n* Properly blend the top into the sides. \n* Go short all the way around.\n* Get a mohawk. \n\nFor what it's worth, I think your hair in the before picture looked pretty good.",

I\u2019ve made a few cuts (how bad could it be?) thankfully my wife stepped in and helped me fade my sides. good job on trying but you might need to learn a few more things before making such a big change in the future. But a barber can blend that up nicely for you and you might even go shorter still as it will likely suit your face. But I strongly recommend you don\u2019t leave it as-is.",

Love running your hands over it. If it needs some tinkering, it won't take long because it will fill in fast. I always say spend the money to go the best the barber/hair stylist in town. Dr. Seuss said something along the lines of In the whole world there is no one just like YOU. You are youer then you.  So I say be the real you, short, long, in between, whatever is you at the time.
