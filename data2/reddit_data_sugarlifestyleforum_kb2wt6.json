    "body": "This is a common thread on SLF.  Many SBs talk to or meet guys who on the surface seem sweet, nice, polite, attractive,charming,etc. and spin a tale to get them in bed at the earliest time with the least effort.    \n\nSOME guys are all that. BUT often they are not SDs. Many are not nice guys and are scammers and manipulators.  Some johns are super nice guys who just want to get laid. Daters can be nice and just want to date. \n\nMy point is don't allow yourselves to be snowed by the up front presentation. Be skeptical at first. Stick to your \"rules\" such as 1) M&G quickly- this rules out texter/pen pals, 2) Have a platonic M&G-this rules out johns and P&Ders often, 3) discuss and agree on arrangement terms including allowance, meeting frequency ,etc-this rules out guys who want to slip one by you(and in you) without paying, 4) Collect allowance before the fireworks begin-this rules out a P&D.   \n\nIf you do this you will eliminate 80% of the non SDs, including the nice guys.",

It\u2019s such a common problem that a new SB I was helping to mentor legitimately thought it was acceptable for a man claiming to be a SD to try to emotionally manipulate \u201cfree sex\u201d out of her. Most of them didn\u2019t even bother trying to have other interactions or time spent that would qualify it as a relationship. So, they just want to meet up, immediately hook up, and pay nothing. It\u2019s gross. One of them, I\u2019ve mentioned in a comment on another post. He said of COURSE he\u2019d *spoil me,* with dinner and drinks at some steak house before going to a Hampton Inn for sex! Next.",
