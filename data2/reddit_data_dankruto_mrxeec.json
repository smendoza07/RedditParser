Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

Because war arc ten ten should shit on Boruto.\n\nSo the Jogan is Boruto\u2019s secret ability which makes him fast enough and strong enough to combat an alien god more powerful than the ten tails?\n\nThis same Boruto is a genius unlike anything the shinobi world has seen before, even greater than minato, kakashi and Itachi, such a genius he can subconsciously create S rank Jutsu in a couple of days. This is how genius this boy is, yet when put into an examination against his peers, he has to cheat in every round in order to win?\n\nYou think that is good writing?",

It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life.

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

All their parents worry they will be weak due to peace times, despite them all being literal geniuses \n\nI mean Boruto literally was swapping hands with Momoshiki who scales past kaguya, even finessing him and landing a rasengan on him close quarters. MOMOSHIKI! \n\nTo put this into perspective, edo tensei Madara using only his base sharingan and taijutsu (plus one genjutsu) took on like 1000 jonin all at once, not a single one of them landed an attack on him. Then you have Boruto, a Genin barely out of the academy, he starts going 1 on 1, with momoshiki, a creature whose power surpasses the ten tails, and he\u2019s finessing him, landing attacks on him. \n\nHow does Boruto perform better against a God than 1000 jonin perform against one powerful shinobi?\n\nBoruto is like a poorly written fanfic",

Not to mention why should the kids be stronger than their parents in peace time? \n\nNearly all the Kage were weaker than their predecessors due to not participating in as many wars, most of the ninjas were weaker than their masters for a long time, Naruto and Sasuke were the only exceptions and that was because they were demigods.\n\nWhy is this generation so strong? There is no reason for it yet. It would be so much better for them to just be average, then become strong afterneclerincing a catastrophe like the current manga or something.",

Or Boruto is faster than 5 gates Lee?\n\n\nOr another example in the difference between a jonin and a genin, in that same fight Gaara is moments away from killing Lee, when Gai in his base form speed blitzes the sand before Gaara (who was well above chunin level in power) could even react. That was the difference between a jonin in his base from and Gaara, the strongest genin at the exams during this time.\n\nDo you think Gai in his base form even approaches Momoshiki in speed? \nDo you think Boruto is faster than Gai?\n\nExplain to me how it makes sense.",

The other time was when Sasuke said to Boruto, \"It's all up to you\" because Sasuke set Boruto up to beat Momoshiki. you're not mentioning the fact that when Borutp tried to beat Momoshiki with the giant rasengan Momoshiki was fast enough to create his own and Boruto had to struggle to even use it. Gai in base form could definitely approach him because he's at Kakashi's level with the sharingan.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

As does the wood clone Jutsu.\n\n\nYour arguments make absolutely no sense, keep defending a terribly written show everyone can see how stupid you look lol\n\nEdit* and as for the genjutsu, you see how even though Madara said he doesn\u2019t fight seriously against a child? To THE KAGE, yet still he doesn\u2019t allow these jonin to land a single attack on him, except for the gust of wind that was incapable of damaging him. Yet Momoshiki just lets Boruto slap him with a rasengan after he gets damaged by his Boruto stream? \nNo, it\u2019s inconsistent writing, plain and simple.",

They grew up with their parents knowledge PLUS everything new. By design, it's how things progress. Should that mean Boruto fumbled into rasengan? Sure! His dad did it in 3 days. The 4th had to literally invent it and figure it out from nothing. Time + experience = efficiency.",

By the time boruto came around, I'd be shocked if anyone batted an eye at a 10-13 year old throwing jutsu like they did after they lived through giant tailed beasts and witnessing S rank level jutsu in every part of the war.\n\nIdk, Konohamaru learned rasengan young too and took out a Pain. THAT'S creeped but no one mentions that. And he's the same age as Boruto then. \n\nBoruto seems written fine imo. I think people are just mad that it isn't Naruto. Scaling, when looking back at naruto, is weird. But we went from adults weaving signs for 5 minutes to make water dragons, to a teenagers hurling concentrated spirit bombs in god mode and helming indestructible gundams to teenagers, to kids aged 10-13 using more than 1 nature of chakra.

Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life. Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense. I already told you that Momoshiki was barely moving so you can\u2019t judge Boruto\u2019s speed this way you moron. Again, did Boruto use his Jogan or the Rasengan in the exams?

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

All their parents worry they will be weak due to peace times, despite them all being literal geniuses \n\nI mean Boruto literally was swapping hands with Momoshiki who scales past kaguya, even finessing him and landing a rasengan on him close quarters. MOMOSHIKI! \n\nTo put this into perspective, edo tensei Madara using only his base sharingan and taijutsu (plus one genjutsu) took on like 1000 jonin all at once, not a single one of them landed an attack on him. Then you have Boruto, a Genin barely out of the academy, he starts going 1 on 1, with momoshiki, a creature whose power surpasses the ten tails, and he\u2019s finessing him, landing attacks on him. \n\nHow does Boruto perform better against a God than 1000 jonin perform against one powerful shinobi?\n\nBoruto is like a poorly written fanfic",

Or Boruto is faster than 5 gates Lee?\n\n\nOr another example in the difference between a jonin and a genin, in that same fight Gaara is moments away from killing Lee, when Gai in his base form speed blitzes the sand before Gaara (who was well above chunin level in power) could even react. That was the difference between a jonin in his base from and Gaara, the strongest genin at the exams during this time.\n\nDo you think Gai in his base form even approaches Momoshiki in speed? \nDo you think Boruto is faster than Gai?\n\nExplain to me how it makes sense.",

Gai in base form could definitely approach him because he's at Kakashi's level with the sharingan.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

THAT'S creeped but no one mentions that. And he's the same age as Boruto then. \n\nBoruto seems written fine imo. I think people are just mad that it isn't Naruto. Scaling, when looking back at naruto, is weird. But we went from adults weaving signs for 5 minutes to make water dragons, to a teenagers hurling concentrated spirit bombs in god mode and helming indestructible gundams to teenagers, to kids aged 10-13 using more than 1 nature of chakra. Fair play imo",

Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

Because war arc ten ten should shit on Boruto.\n\nSo the Jogan is Boruto\u2019s secret ability which makes him fast enough and strong enough to combat an alien god more powerful than the ten tails?\n\nThis same Boruto is a genius unlike anything the shinobi world has seen before, even greater than minato, kakashi and Itachi, such a genius he can subconsciously create S rank Jutsu in a couple of days. This is how genius this boy is, yet when put into an examination against his peers, he has to cheat in every round in order to win?\n\nYou think that is good writing?",

It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life. Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense. I already told you that Momoshiki was barely moving so you can\u2019t judge Boruto\u2019s speed this way you moron. Again, did Boruto use his Jogan or the Rasengan in the exams?

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

All their parents worry they will be weak due to peace times, despite them all being literal geniuses \n\nI mean Boruto literally was swapping hands with Momoshiki who scales past kaguya, even finessing him and landing a rasengan on him close quarters. MOMOSHIKI! \n\nTo put this into perspective, edo tensei Madara using only his base sharingan and taijutsu (plus one genjutsu) took on like 1000 jonin all at once, not a single one of them landed an attack on him. Then you have Boruto, a Genin barely out of the academy, he starts going 1 on 1, with momoshiki, a creature whose power surpasses the ten tails, and he\u2019s finessing him, landing attacks on him. \n\nHow does Boruto perform better against a God than 1000 jonin perform against one powerful shinobi?\n\nBoruto is like a poorly written fanfic",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

Hahaha \n\nGet real mate they never land an attack on MADARA, they managed to seal one clone using all five kage, a clone being a fraction of his actual power.\n\nEdit\n[this is a better link](https://youtu.be/MC3KPm3YpHs) temari sent him flying farther than I remember but done zero damage, quite literally brushes it off",

THAT'S creeped but no one mentions that. And he's the same age as Boruto then. \n\nBoruto seems written fine imo. I think people are just mad that it isn't Naruto. Scaling, when looking back at naruto, is weird. But we went from adults weaving signs for 5 minutes to make water dragons, to a teenagers hurling concentrated spirit bombs in god mode and helming indestructible gundams to teenagers, to kids aged 10-13 using more than 1 nature of chakra.

Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here, it makes no sense.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between an adult expecting a child to be weak and a God underestimating a child 4 times in a row in a battle to the death, and losing his life as a result.

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

All their parents worry they will be weak due to peace times, despite them all being literal geniuses \n\nI mean Boruto literally was swapping hands with Momoshiki who scales past kaguya, even finessing him and landing a rasengan on him close quarters. MOMOSHIKI! \n\nTo put this into perspective, edo tensei Madara using only his base sharingan and taijutsu (plus one genjutsu) took on like 1000 jonin all at once, not a single one of them landed an attack on him. Then you have Boruto, a Genin barely out of the academy, he starts going 1 on 1, with momoshiki, a creature whose power surpasses the ten tails, and he\u2019s finessing him, landing attacks on him. \n\nHow does Boruto perform better against a God than 1000 jonin perform against one powerful shinobi?\n\nBoruto is like a poorly written fanfic",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise?

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

The wood clone doesn\u2019t get to use it\u2019s full potential when the user is occupied with other tasks, but what was madara doing? Hiding in a tree?

THAT'S creeped but no one mentions that. And he's the same age as Boruto then. \n\nBoruto seems written fine imo. I think people are just mad that it isn't Naruto. Scaling, when looking back at naruto, is weird. But we went from adults weaving signs for 5 minutes to make water dragons, to a teenagers hurling concentrated spirit bombs in god mode and helming indestructible gundams to teenagers, to kids aged 10-13 using more than 1 nature of chakra. Fair play imo",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

All their parents worry they will be weak due to peace times, despite them all being literal geniuses \n\nI mean Boruto literally was swapping hands with Momoshiki who scales past kaguya, even finessing him and landing a rasengan on him close quarters. MOMOSHIKI! \n\nTo put this into perspective, edo tensei Madara using only his base sharingan and taijutsu (plus one genjutsu) took on like 1000 jonin all at once, not a single one of them landed an attack on him. Then you have Boruto, a Genin barely out of the academy, he starts going 1 on 1, with momoshiki, a creature whose power surpasses the ten tails, and he\u2019s finessing him, landing attacks on him. \n\nHow does Boruto perform better against a God than 1000 jonin perform against one powerful shinobi?\n\nBoruto is like a poorly written fanfic",

Not to mention why should the kids be stronger than their parents in peace time? \n\nNearly all the Kage were weaker than their predecessors due to not participating in as many wars, most of the ninjas were weaker than their masters for a long time, Naruto and Sasuke were the only exceptions and that was because they were demigods.\n\nWhy is this generation so strong? There is no reason for it yet. It would be so much better for them to just be average, then become strong afterneclerincing a catastrophe like the current manga or something.",

That was the difference between a jonin in his base from and Gaara, the strongest genin at the exams during this time.\n\nDo you think Gai in his base form even approaches Momoshiki in speed? \nDo you think Boruto is faster than Gai?\n\nExplain to me how it makes sense.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

Momoshiki had a cocky smile on his face when he put his rasengan against Boruto\u2019s to the test and only then realized he should\u2019ve fought him seriously from the start, but it was too late and Boruto overpowered him. It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life. Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense. I already told you that Momoshiki was barely moving so you can\u2019t judge Boruto\u2019s speed this way you moron. Again, did Boruto use his Jogan or the Rasengan in the exams?

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

None of the parents worry about being weak and they just want to train their children. These are fictional characters who can't control what they're doing and the theme of Boruto is the next generation surpassing their parents.",

Not to mention why should the kids be stronger than their parents in peace time? \n\nNearly all the Kage were weaker than their predecessors due to not participating in as many wars, most of the ninjas were weaker than their masters for a long time, Naruto and Sasuke were the only exceptions and that was because they were demigods.\n\nWhy is this generation so strong? There is no reason for it yet. It would be so much better for them to just be average, then become strong afterneclerincing a catastrophe like the current manga or something.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise?

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

THAT'S creeped but no one mentions that. And he's the same age as Boruto then. \n\nBoruto seems written fine imo. I think people are just mad that it isn't Naruto. Scaling, when looking back at naruto, is weird. But we went from adults weaving signs for 5 minutes to make water dragons, to a teenagers hurling concentrated spirit bombs in god mode and helming indestructible gundams to teenagers, to kids aged 10-13 using more than 1 nature of chakra.

Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life. Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense. I already told you that Momoshiki was barely moving so you can\u2019t judge Boruto\u2019s speed this way you moron. Again, did Boruto use his Jogan or the Rasengan in the exams?

That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here, it makes no sense.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between an adult expecting a child to be weak and a God underestimating a child 4 times in a row in a battle to the death, and losing his life as a result.

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki.

Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

Are you really that deluded you think he was so complacent he lost the entire fight because he didn\u2019t want to go serious against a child?\n\nMadara only told them that when he displayed his perfect Susano\u2019o and they couldn\u2019t believe he had been hiding such power, but for the entire fight he dominated them and never allowed them even a single attack in. Except for 1 which he did on purpose to demoralise them.\n\nThe difference in power between them should be so great that even if he held back he would demolish him. He should 100,000 times stronger than Boruto but he let him kill him?\n\nStfu it\u2019s just a very poorly written show, which makes no sense. \n\nMomoshiki moves so fast kage can\u2019t react to him but he lets a child kill him, nice one\n\nEdit*\n\nAlso do I want to see a couple episodes of Boruto learning rasengan? \nHow many episodes did we watch of nothing but Boruto playing video games, eating cheeseburgers and fighting whichever one of his mates has been infected by the dark chakra? Literally same shit every week with just a different character infected\n\nI don\u2019t think you know what a fact is, so he was taken by surprise by the Boruto stream, then again by the rasengan then again by the big rasengan? Is he a retard?\n\nYou think that\u2019s smart writing too? A god was killed by a child because he underestimated 3 times in a row?\n\nKakashi massively underestimated Sasuke during the bell exam, he still kicked the shit out of him effortlessly, and that sasuke was a lot closer in power to kakashi than even war arc kakashi would be to Momoshiki",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

Or Boruto is faster than 5 gates Lee?\n\n\nOr another example in the difference between a jonin and a genin, in that same fight Gaara is moments away from killing Lee, when Gai in his base form speed blitzes the sand before Gaara (who was well above chunin level in power) could even react. That was the difference between a jonin in his base from and Gaara, the strongest genin at the exams during this time.\n\nDo you think Gai in his base form even approaches Momoshiki in speed? \nDo you think Boruto is faster than Gai?\n\nExplain to me how it makes sense.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

Nothing about the Academy Training intrinsically prepared them to learn S Rank Techniques than the training in the prior series. \n\nNaruto had already learned water walking, tree climbing and mastered his wind element training and it took him at least a week with countless clones, near 200 a day. And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill. It's simply learning to push the right amount of Chakra. When Jiraya trained Naruto, he always had him at low chakra to get him to pull on the Nine-Tails Chakra.",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

[pics here](https://imgur.com/a/wcGwL9I)\n\nedit to answer  your question: afaik the reason everyone doesn't use it is because most ninja don't have the level of chakra control it takes to do it, and even if they did you'd need a lot of chakra for it to be a good option for you regularly, Boruto fits this criteria being gifted I guess. in the entirety of naruto there's less than a dozen people who can use it and pretty much all of them are OP, Boruto is just another one.",

Or Boruto is faster than 5 gates Lee?\n\n\nOr another example in the difference between a jonin and a genin, in that same fight Gaara is moments away from killing Lee, when Gai in his base form speed blitzes the sand before Gaara (who was well above chunin level in power) could even react. That was the difference between a jonin in his base from and Gaara, the strongest genin at the exams during this time.\n\nDo you think Gai in his base form even approaches Momoshiki in speed? \nDo you think Boruto is faster than Gai?\n\nExplain to me how it makes sense.",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

And even then, it was still impossible to his view point until he added another clone. \n\nAnd the summoning Jutsu doesn't require some innate skill.

Momoshiki had a cocky smile on his face when he put his rasengan against Boruto\u2019s to the test and only then realized he should\u2019ve fought him seriously from the start, but it was too late and Boruto overpowered him. It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life. Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense. I already told you that Momoshiki was barely moving so you can\u2019t judge Boruto\u2019s speed this way you moron. Again, did Boruto use his Jogan or the Rasengan in the exams?

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

It\u2019s in the show, you just need to open your eyes and use your brain for once in your life. Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense.

That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here, it makes no sense.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between an adult expecting a child to be weak and a God underestimating a child 4 times in a row in a battle to the death, and losing his life as a result. Wtf does the shadow possession have to do with anything? Momoshiki can create blasts that could level a town. \n\nYour arguments literally make no sense",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise?

We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow.

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Momoshiki moves so fast that Kage level opponents can\u2019t even react to his speed. Do you know how powerful you\u2019d have to be to approach him fast enough to take him by surprise? More powerful than a fucking kage.\n\nSo 4/5 kage can\u2019t even react to Momoshikis immense speed, but Boruto moves fast enough that he can slip past momoshikis guard after the initial surprise Boruto stream, that is your stance and that makes sense to you?\n\nMomoshiki was never said to have speed? We literally just watched him move so fast that 4 kage who he was fighting at the time and were expecting him to attack couldn\u2019t even react to his movements, and were also all defeated by 1 taijutsu blow. Momoshiki in this instance moving so fast Gaaras own sand which moves of its own accord so fast that it took Lee 5 gates to even get around it when they were both children, couldn\u2019t react to Momoshiki. Yet Boruto is reacting to Momoshiki and even outpacing him?\n\n\nLook the fact that it doesn\u2019t make any sense is just one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like it, but if you can look past that and still like the show, great! Just say that, but don\u2019t pretend it makes any sense.\n\nIf you still are determined to tell me it makes sense, explain why Momoshiki was so fast that kage could not even react to him, kazekage gaaras sand which moves of its own accord could not react to him, but Boruto can react and even outmanoeuvre him.",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here, it makes no sense.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between an adult expecting a child to be weak and a God underestimating a child 4 times in a row in a battle to the death, and losing his life as a result.

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Because war arc ten ten should shit on Boruto.\n\nSo the Jogan is Boruto\u2019s secret ability which makes him fast enough and strong enough to combat an alien god more powerful than the ten tails?\n\nThis same Boruto is a genius unlike anything the shinobi world has seen before, even greater than minato, kakashi and Itachi, such a genius he can subconsciously create S rank Jutsu in a couple of days. This is how genius this boy is, yet when put into an examination against his peers, he has to cheat in every round in order to win?\n\nYou think that is good writing?",

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Because war arc ten ten should shit on Boruto.\n\nSo the Jogan is Boruto\u2019s secret ability which makes him fast enough and strong enough to combat an alien god more powerful than the ten tails?\n\nThis same Boruto is a genius unlike anything the shinobi world has seen before, even greater than minato, kakashi and Itachi, such a genius he can subconsciously create S rank Jutsu in a couple of days.

(Cheating to win is losing)\n\nNow let\u2019s think back to Lee vs Gaara, when Lee opened his 5 gates he moved so fast that the other genin couldn\u2019t even follow his movements with their eyes. Gaara ends up winning and crushes his left leg and arm, and then covers the rest of his body about to kill him, before Gaara has time to clench his fist, Might Guy in his part 1 base form moves so quickly that before Gaara (who is well above chunin level) even notices he\u2019s there, guy has knocked back the sand. This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",

Kaguya didn\u2019t show any signs that she was just playing with team 7 so your shitty argument makes no sense. I already told you that Momoshiki was barely moving so you can\u2019t judge Boruto\u2019s speed this way you moron. Again, did Boruto use his Jogan or the Rasengan in the exams? Conveniently ignoring everything to push your narrative...",

This is how fast Gai, a Jonin, was in his base form, in part 1. \n\nNow as we know Momoshiki scales past Kaguya, kaguya who had the power of the ten tails, the same ten tails which was made up of half the ninetails chakra, along with every other beast.\n\nNaruto when unlocking the most basic from of his ninetails chakra mode, made up of half the ninetails chakra, went from an average speed shinobi to the fastest man alive.\n\nSo Momoshiki who has more power than the ten tails, understandably effortlessly defeats 4 kage in seconds, using basic strikes. KAGE.\n\nThis same Momoshiki moments after being so fast and powerful that literal Kage opponents couldn\u2019t react to his speed or withstand a punch from him, gets tagged with a Jutsu from a little boy, Momoshiki who moves too fast for the Raikage to even react to him, can\u2019t dodge Boruto stream? \n\nThe same Momoshiki who was so strong, he merely has to punch a Kage to knock them out, and so fast they cannot defend themselves from him, Boruto manages to sidestep him and slap his hand away. How is Momoshiki not effortlessly either moving away, or successfully blocking this child? \n\nYou\u2019re not appreciating the power difference between a 12 year old genin and a Kage, which should be immeasurable, you\u2019re also not appreciating the difference between any kage (except naruto obviously) and Momoshiki, which again should be immeasurable. \n\nYet this child is doing FAR better against Momoshiki than 4/5 kage combined. \n\nIt would be like Saiyan saga Chiaoutzu slapping down super Saiyan Goku",
