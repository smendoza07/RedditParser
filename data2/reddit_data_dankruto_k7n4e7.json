Madara was too OP so he replaces him with an even stronger foe? That doesn't make sense. I didn't like the Kaguya twist but Kishi definitley didn't do it because Madara was too OP. He could've easily just wrote his defeat by having Naruto and Sasuke fight hard or seal him exactly like Kaguya.",

What it actually was, was he wanted to immediately top the main villain and try to write in a wild twist. \n\nThe problem was that he got too carried away with it and the Otsutsuki are just way out of left field. Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either. He was way to contradictory. \n\n\"I must create a world without violence and suffering... but first let me kill everyone and inflict catastrophic levels of violence and suffering that the world has never seen??? All while laughing manicialy and acting like its a giant game\"",

And I think it\u2019s because the fact that Madara now had BOTH Rinnegan was too much to handle, so they got him backstabbed and pulled out Kaguya, Kishimoto made the Sage of six paths tell them about that sealing jutsu and they used it to seal her. For that kind of dumb shit maybe I want Kodachi to keep doing the manga lol it\u2019s been fire so far.",

It kinda ruined his frame, like this spark of a demigod and ability to walk through impossible like walking through a park didn't match his helplessness in having all of this taken away in a matter of a simple backstab. He should've fought. My friend said: it would be awesome if Madara tried to fight back and help Naruto and Sasuke seal the rabbit Queen. That'd really help rebuild the character.\n\nEDIT: IMO it would be way better to see (even via more fillers) him overcoming Kaguya somewhat the way Obito overcame the 10 tails. Madara was already established, with hints to his existence, a colorful backstory and this frame of being indestructible, beyond humanity and death. Just like Hashirama he was powerful enough to break control of edo tensei. All taken away with what? Black Zetsu going full Kakashi through his back. And poof, replaced with basically a new character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Kaguya. But come on. Imagine he's now in control of all Kaguya's power like: \"Look at me - I'm the chakra goddess now\".",

Madara was too OP so he replaces him with an even stronger foe? That doesn't make sense. I didn't like the Kaguya twist but Kishi definitley didn't do it because Madara was too OP.

What it actually was, was he wanted to immediately top the main villain and try to write in a wild twist. \n\nThe problem was that he got too carried away with it and the Otsutsuki are just way out of left field. Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either. He was way to contradictory. \n\n\"I must create a world without violence and suffering... but first let me kill everyone and inflict catastrophic levels of violence and suffering that the world has never seen??? All while laughing manicialy and acting like its a giant game\"",

It kinda ruined his frame, like this spark of a demigod and ability to walk through impossible like walking through a park didn't match his helplessness in having all of this taken away in a matter of a simple backstab. He should've fought. My friend said: it would be awesome if Madara tried to fight back and help Naruto and Sasuke seal the rabbit Queen. That'd really help rebuild the character.\n\nEDIT: IMO it would be way better to see (even via more fillers) him overcoming Kaguya somewhat the way Obito overcame the 10 tails. Madara was already established, with hints to his existence, a colorful backstory and this frame of being indestructible, beyond humanity and death. Just like Hashirama he was powerful enough to break control of edo tensei. All taken away with what? Black Zetsu going full Kakashi through his back. And poof, replaced with basically a new character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Kaguya. But come on. Imagine he's now in control of all Kaguya's power like: \"Look at me - I'm the chakra goddess now\".",

Madara was too OP so he replaces him with an even stronger foe? That doesn't make sense. I didn't like the Kaguya twist but Kishi definitley didn't do it because Madara was too OP. He could've easily just wrote his defeat by having Naruto and Sasuke fight hard or seal him exactly like Kaguya.",

What it actually was, was he wanted to immediately top the main villain and try to write in a wild twist. \n\nThe problem was that he got too carried away with it and the Otsutsuki are just way out of left field. Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either. He was way to contradictory. \n\n\"I must create a world without violence and suffering... but first let me kill everyone and inflict catastrophic levels of violence and suffering that the world has never seen???

It kinda ruined his frame, like this spark of a demigod and ability to walk through impossible like walking through a park didn't match his helplessness in having all of this taken away in a matter of a simple backstab. He should've fought. My friend said: it would be awesome if Madara tried to fight back and help Naruto and Sasuke seal the rabbit Queen. That'd really help rebuild the character.\n\nEDIT: IMO it would be way better to see (even via more fillers) him overcoming Kaguya somewhat the way Obito overcame the 10 tails. Madara was already established, with hints to his existence, a colorful backstory and this frame of being indestructible, beyond humanity and death. Just like Hashirama he was powerful enough to break control of edo tensei. All taken away with what? Black Zetsu going full Kakashi through his back. And poof, replaced with basically a new character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Kaguya. But come on. Imagine he's now in control of all Kaguya's power like: \"Look at me - I'm the chakra goddess now\".",

Madara was too OP so he replaces him with an even stronger foe? That doesn't make sense. I didn't like the Kaguya twist but Kishi definitley didn't do it because Madara was too OP. He could've easily just wrote his defeat by having Naruto and Sasuke fight hard or seal him exactly like Kaguya.",

What it actually was, was he wanted to immediately top the main villain and try to write in a wild twist. \n\nThe problem was that he got too carried away with it and the Otsutsuki are just way out of left field. Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either. He was way to contradictory. \n\n\"I must create a world without violence and suffering... but first let me kill everyone and inflict catastrophic levels of violence and suffering that the world has never seen??? All while laughing manicialy and acting like its a giant game\"",

It kinda ruined his frame, like this spark of a demigod and ability to walk through impossible like walking through a park didn't match his helplessness in having all of this taken away in a matter of a simple backstab. He should've fought. My friend said: it would be awesome if Madara tried to fight back and help Naruto and Sasuke seal the rabbit Queen. That'd really help rebuild the character.\n\nEDIT: IMO it would be way better to see (even via more fillers) him overcoming Kaguya somewhat the way Obito overcame the 10 tails. Madara was already established, with hints to his existence, a colorful backstory and this frame of being indestructible, beyond humanity and death. Just like Hashirama he was powerful enough to break control of edo tensei. All taken away with what? Black Zetsu going full Kakashi through his back. And poof, replaced with basically a new character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Kaguya. But come on. Imagine he's now in control of all Kaguya's power like: \"Look at me - I'm the chakra goddess now\".",

Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either.

It kinda ruined his frame, like this spark of a demigod and ability to walk through impossible like walking through a park didn't match his helplessness in having all of this taken away in a matter of a simple backstab. He should've fought. My friend said: it would be awesome if Madara tried to fight back and help Naruto and Sasuke seal the rabbit Queen. That'd really help rebuild the character.\n\nEDIT: IMO it would be way better to see (even via more fillers) him overcoming Kaguya somewhat the way Obito overcame the 10 tails. Madara was already established, with hints to his existence, a colorful backstory and this frame of being indestructible, beyond humanity and death. Just like Hashirama he was powerful enough to break control of edo tensei. All taken away with what? Black Zetsu going full Kakashi through his back. And poof, replaced with basically a new character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Kaguya. But come on. Imagine he's now in control of all Kaguya's power like: \"Look at me - I'm the chakra goddess now\".",

Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either. He was way to contradictory. \n\n\"I must create a world without violence and suffering... but first let me kill everyone and inflict catastrophic levels of violence and suffering that the world has never seen???

Kaguya was absolutely stronger and more OP, but the implementation into the story was terrible. Kishimoto should have alluded to them far earlier and a bit more intensive, so it didn't feel like some last minute surprise.\n\nI know it's also not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Madara either. He was way to contradictory. \n\n\"I must create a world without violence and suffering... but first let me kill everyone and inflict catastrophic levels of violence and suffering that the world has never seen???
