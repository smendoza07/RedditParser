    "body": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m very new to the bowl (less than a week) and honestly was not expecting much. There aren\u2019t a ton of people in my area, most either from NYC or Boston. However, I found a few men somewhat locally which was even better, since I was okay with doing some traveling.\n\nI\u2019m also a bigger girl. I knew that could really work against me but I made it very clear in my profile with pictures and description, so there we no surprises. I have a good face and while bigger, my figure is pretty proportional, and I\u2019m also in the process of losing weight. So yeah. \n\nI\u2019ve been talking to this gentleman for a few days. During this time I had a job interview and he gave me great advice and was very encouraging. I was looking forward to our M&G but I was a bit nervous, especially with the age gap (I\u2019m 23 and he\u2019s in his early 60s). I wasn\u2019t sure how well conversation would flow.\n\nToday we met at Starbucks, he was a little late but he updated me letting me know he was close. He had an hour long break from work so we settled in with our drinks and got to chatting. He did most of the talking - I\u2019d ask him a question and he would get very animated. I enjoyed listening to him tell me about his travels and adventures. He also complimented me for my appearance without being weird or gross about it. When he had to go, he said he was disappointed we couldn\u2019t chat for longer and asked to walk me to my car. I said sure, and when we got there, he hugged me, gave me a kiss on the cheek and said he had something for me. I looked down and he had money in his hand. I saw a $20 and I was excited, because I didn\u2019t expect anything. I thanked him and we both went our separate ways. When in my car, I looked and it was actually $100! By the time I got home he had sent me a message thanking me and asking me to set up a time next week, and we\u2019re going to discuss $$ when he\u2019s home from work.\n\nI\u2019m not putting all my eggs in one basket, as I have another M&G next week but I am excited that things are working out well and that the first man I met was so kind. Thanks to this forum for helping me get started!\n\nEdit: we discussed the ppm and he offered a little less than I wanted so I countered and he said I would make a great saleswoman (the position I\u2019m applying for) and happily agreed.",

I love when the date seems to fly by.\n\nBigger girl here(22) (size20), actually quite on the chubbier side.\nI do have to say that your confidence is a great asset! So even if you\u2019re losing weight, there\u2019s no need to mention it. Make it clear your comfortable at your current state. And when you lose weight , just show it off. \n\nIve only been in the life style for a year and a bit, but I hear this very often being a bigger girl: Both daddies are so relieved that I don\u2019t talk about my weight/weight loss at all. \nOf course being a sb has a lot to do with appearance, attitude up there too, and this extends to things like your own self awareness, especially for us thick girls.\n\nMy favorite daddy who definitely has a way with words said \u201cwe know what we signed up for , and it\u2019s an silent understanding that need not be spoken about\u201d and that really stuck with me :) \n\n\nBest wishes!",
