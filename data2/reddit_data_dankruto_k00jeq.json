Also 15 years old Shisui is way faster than Minato in terms of body movement and so is Itachi too and other high speed fighters, like Gai sensei (with some gates), Orochimaru in Boruto, for example. I can't name any more characters that are speed based. But you get what I mean. Sadly many people misunderstand Minato's speed. Minato is a regular Jonin ninja without the FTG, nothing really special other than his big brain and talent. But without the FTG the Raikage could easily blitzed him and he would have died there. The FTG makes him ridiculously strong and competitive against faster fighters like him. Sadly many people don't know this and overrate Minato. :(",

The 2 never fought but there are several ways to estimate the power difference between them. \n\nFirstly, izuna, said to be equal in strength to madara (both superior to itachi), was defeated by tobirama and his flying raijin. It is well known that minato is faster and more powerful than tobirama, so let's consider it a win by proxy. \n\nSecondly, itachi said that fighting jiraiya would result in a draw in the best case scenario, more likely a loss. By jiraiya's own admission, minato was more proficient in his techniques than jiraiya himself, he even had trouble summoning gamabunta often times, something minato could do anytime he wanted. \n\nThirdly, the reason itachi is so powerful is because of his ocular techniques, unfortunately their biggest weakness is speed. The raikage is so fast that he cannot be put under genjutsu and not even a mangekyou can track his movements. Amaterasu can be dodged with speed as well. \nEven madara had to first immobilise the raikage before putting him under a genjutsu, and minato is much faster than him.\n\nEven if he did get hit by amaterasu, minato has the ability to teleport away from abilities that touch him, he did so during the war when he teleported away from amaterasu and kamui. \nHe can also teleport chakra using flying raijin (the bijuu ball), similar to a kamui, so him being able to teleport away parts of itachi's susanoo like the totsuka blade or yata mirror is not unthinkable. \n\nAdding to all of that, minato is a high level sensory type ninja who can use sage chakra. You cannot sneak up on him. If he is trapped in a genjutsu, he can get out with sage chakra. \n\nThe only way to defeat him is to be faster than him, and itachi is not. \n\nIf uchihas were paper, minato would be scissors.\n\nAlso he never got to his full potential since he died young. You could argue the same for itachi, but he was at the height (or near it) of his ocular prowess",

FTG made him able to teleport, sure he would win any speed based race, lmao. Also he is one of the most intelligent characters ever. Same as Itachi, he makes a plan in seconds and wins. And the only reason Itachi didn't beat Minato is because he didn't wanted to, he stayed longer there and did more fights unnecessary, just to test himself. Still was just a few seconds slower than Minato's record, who probably went straight to the finish and also teleported. But sure, let's dickride Minato, coz he is the best character ever, I love him too. But facts are facts. In terms of body movement speed, he isn't really special. He isn't faster than a regular Jounin. \n\nYou're actually right about most of the Uchihas. Itachi and Shisui are the only talents who are also Kage levels without the Sharingan. But they also rely on their power, but hey, that's what happens when you born with something strong. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIt's good to see that I made 20+ people mad with the truth. :D And the best part is that I never said Minato is weak, hell no, boi, he is ridiculously strong and has the best personality ever and also he is the best dad. <3 I luv him. :3 But just because he is the best and most loveable character, he isn't the strongest in the entire Narutoverse and the FTG doesn't makes him fast in terms of body movement. :)\n\nFacts are facts, deal with them. Dickriding Minato just because you love him, doesn't changes that in terms of body movement speed he isn't really special and there are faster characters than him.",

Imagine spending *decades* collecting these implants in secret...and you use them to absorb Sausage throwing mere kunai at you (when said implants have like month+ at best of a cooldown). For an old man bent on surviving (and even entertaining the idea of taking on \"\"madara\"\" after Sausage) he sure didn't fight like it.",

She had 2 moments in the original show, the ino fight & defending her team in OG naruto. Every other time is crying about whatever or just not really being involved. \n\nIMO they could've done her better if she won against Ino and then had a well done fight against dosu, whether its a tie/loss/win doesn't matter just give her some feats. \n\nThen in Shippuden we know she's strong and we know that she's supposed to be at least ranked 3rd out of the konoha 12, and it shows when she wins against an akatsuki member, but she still spent most of the time either being passive or whining about how naruto/Sasuke outpaced her, then saying \"I can do this!!!\" before making like 0 difference lmao. \n\nThey could have done her better in Shippuden by just keeping up the same level of badass capable ninjaness she had when she beat Sasori. Make her react to things instantly. She's supposed to be super smart and super strong, but she didn't act like it and they didn't portray her as if she was \n\nAlso the obito-eye thing that didn't translate well from Manga to anime really really didn't help.",

But then a couple of things au realized. \nAs kids, she had a normal childhood. Her family wasn\u2019t annihilated leaving her alone and cold. She doesn\u2019t have a raging beast in her that makes everyone hate her. Her biggest problem growing up was that she had a big forehead. And that she has a crush on a guy. If we just think about it, it is what girls her age worry about! There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. \nAlso, girls as a whole in Naruto have been downplayed IMO. Don\u2019t even get me started on the pathetic excuse that is Hinata Hyuga. Ad a Hyuga clan with Byakyugan, and Neji and the training, she had SO SO SO much badass potential but it went absolutely nowhere. I was so excited about her fight with Pain but it was over before it was even started. Ugh. Nevermind, coming back to the point. \nSakura was the one with the best chakra control and she utilizes that well. She goes into medical ninjutsu which compliments her so much. She turns out to be one of the best medical ninjas. She even surpasses Tsunade. She has a huge role in the war helping replenish the chakras, and she is actually pretty amazing at what she does. She has also saved the main characters a bunch of times. She is a pretty badass shinobi. Just because she did not train in combat training like Naruto and Sasuke, she automatically gets hate. She has tremendous power, yes. That is an added bonus. But her speciality lies in the medical field. She becomes the head Medical person in Konoha. We didn\u2019t get to see 30 episodes of her training with Tsunade but the fact that she trained doesn\u2019t go away. She can summon the huge ass slug like both Sasuke and Naruto and while the boys fight up front, her battlefield is behind the scene. \nAlso, she loves Sasuke. Okay.. and??? So what? She loved him from Day 1 and is committed to the end. Let her be. Hypocrites criticize her loving Sasuke while saying Naruto-Hinata ship is cute. Fuck that. Sasuke Sakura have development and you actually get to see a relationship develop. Naruto and Hinata have honestly one of the most awkward relationship to ever exist. Let her be for simping on Sasuke. Anyone who uses that to hate on her is just reaching. \nShe grows. She grows from a sensitive, insecure whiny kid to a strong, powerful woman who handles herself, her family and the entire Medical dept. fuck all these unnecessary Sakura haters.",

Her childhood was \"normal\" until she went to an academy for future killers, then graduated and became a soldier at like 12/13. She didn't have to start off like naruto or Sasuke did but Kishimoto could've written her transition from school  girl to ninja a lot more smoother by like, actually giving her screen time that wasn't crying, and having her just immediately show the progress she's made (see:sarada) instead of having her whine/monolog \n\nYes she specializes in medical ninjutsu and that's cool and all but she's also combat trained as we see when she actually has fights. Again, she's just written really really fucking badly in 90% of the conflicts she finds herself in. \n\nDon't think the shipping hate really is that big of a deal considering how awful/forced the romance in the show is overall.",

You need someone behind you to fight someone?,why do you keep punching Naruto for no good reason? For comedy? naah, why do you still want to marry a guy who tried to kill you like 3 times? Why do you agree on killing Sasuke and take a squad with you and then knock them out, so that you can kill him yourself? And you hesitate to kill because he might actually have feelings for you? Her lack of decision making, too many tsundere moments, boasting shit like 'I've caught up to these two' etc is what makes me hate her.",

I don\u2019t know  how to use the feature you used to break up texts so I\u2019ll try my best lol \n\nYeah, she\u2019s poorly written. That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

I am not saying that he wasn\u2019t already a threat to the village because he definetly was but the way the dealt with the situation was definetly bad. They were lucky that he eventually found people willing to help him",

Also 15 years old Shisui is way faster than Minato in terms of body movement and so is Itachi too and other high speed fighters, like Gai sensei (with some gates), Orochimaru in Boruto, for example. I can't name any more characters that are speed based. But you get what I mean. Sadly many people misunderstand Minato's speed. Minato is a regular Jonin ninja without the FTG, nothing really special other than his big brain and talent. But without the FTG the Raikage could easily blitzed him and he would have died there. The FTG makes him ridiculously strong and competitive against faster fighters like him. Sadly many people don't know this and overrate Minato. :(",

The 2 never fought but there are several ways to estimate the power difference between them. \n\nFirstly, izuna, said to be equal in strength to madara (both superior to itachi), was defeated by tobirama and his flying raijin. It is well known that minato is faster and more powerful than tobirama, so let's consider it a win by proxy. \n\nSecondly, itachi said that fighting jiraiya would result in a draw in the best case scenario, more likely a loss. By jiraiya's own admission, minato was more proficient in his techniques than jiraiya himself, he even had trouble summoning gamabunta often times, something minato could do anytime he wanted. \n\nThirdly, the reason itachi is so powerful is because of his ocular techniques, unfortunately their biggest weakness is speed. The raikage is so fast that he cannot be put under genjutsu and not even a mangekyou can track his movements. Amaterasu can be dodged with speed as well. \nEven madara had to first immobilise the raikage before putting him under a genjutsu, and minato is much faster than him.\n\nEven if he did get hit by amaterasu, minato has the ability to teleport away from abilities that touch him, he did so during the war when he teleported away from amaterasu and kamui. \nHe can also teleport chakra using flying raijin (the bijuu ball), similar to a kamui, so him being able to teleport away parts of itachi's susanoo like the totsuka blade or yata mirror is not unthinkable. \n\nAdding to all of that, minato is a high level sensory type ninja who can use sage chakra. You cannot sneak up on him. If he is trapped in a genjutsu, he can get out with sage chakra. \n\nThe only way to defeat him is to be faster than him, and itachi is not. \n\nIf uchihas were paper, minato would be scissors.\n\nAlso he never got to his full potential since he died young. You could argue the same for itachi, but he was at the height (or near it) of his ocular prowess",

FTG made him able to teleport, sure he would win any speed based race, lmao. Also he is one of the most intelligent characters ever. Same as Itachi, he makes a plan in seconds and wins. And the only reason Itachi didn't beat Minato is because he didn't wanted to, he stayed longer there and did more fights unnecessary, just to test himself. Still was just a few seconds slower than Minato's record, who probably went straight to the finish and also teleported. But sure, let's dickride Minato, coz he is the best character ever, I love him too. But facts are facts. In terms of body movement speed, he isn't really special. He isn't faster than a regular Jounin. \n\nYou're actually right about most of the Uchihas. Itachi and Shisui are the only talents who are also Kage levels without the Sharingan. But they also rely on their power, but hey, that's what happens when you born with something strong. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIt's good to see that I made 20+ people mad with the truth. :D And the best part is that I never said Minato is weak, hell no, boi, he is ridiculously strong and has the best personality ever and also he is the best dad. <3 I luv him. :3 But just because he is the best and most loveable character, he isn't the strongest in the entire Narutoverse and the FTG doesn't makes him fast in terms of body movement. :)\n\nFacts are facts, deal with them. Dickriding Minato just because you love him, doesn't changes that in terms of body movement speed he isn't really special and there are faster characters than him.",

She had 2 moments in the original show, the ino fight & defending her team in OG naruto. Every other time is crying about whatever or just not really being involved. \n\nIMO they could've done her better if she won against Ino and then had a well done fight against dosu, whether its a tie/loss/win doesn't matter just give her some feats. \n\nThen in Shippuden we know she's strong and we know that she's supposed to be at least ranked 3rd out of the konoha 12, and it shows when she wins against an akatsuki member, but she still spent most of the time either being passive or whining about how naruto/Sasuke outpaced her, then saying \"I can do this!!!\" before making like 0 difference lmao. \n\nThey could have done her better in Shippuden by just keeping up the same level of badass capable ninjaness she had when she beat Sasori. Make her react to things instantly. She's supposed to be super smart and super strong, but she didn't act like it and they didn't portray her as if she was \n\nAlso the obito-eye thing that didn't translate well from Manga to anime really really didn't help.",

But then a couple of things au realized. \nAs kids, she had a normal childhood. Her family wasn\u2019t annihilated leaving her alone and cold. She doesn\u2019t have a raging beast in her that makes everyone hate her. Her biggest problem growing up was that she had a big forehead. And that she has a crush on a guy. If we just think about it, it is what girls her age worry about! There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. \nAlso, girls as a whole in Naruto have been downplayed IMO. Don\u2019t even get me started on the pathetic excuse that is Hinata Hyuga. Ad a Hyuga clan with Byakyugan, and Neji and the training, she had SO SO SO much badass potential but it went absolutely nowhere. I was so excited about her fight with Pain but it was over before it was even started. Ugh. Nevermind, coming back to the point. \nSakura was the one with the best chakra control and she utilizes that well. She goes into medical ninjutsu which compliments her so much. She turns out to be one of the best medical ninjas. She even surpasses Tsunade. She has a huge role in the war helping replenish the chakras, and she is actually pretty amazing at what she does. She has also saved the main characters a bunch of times. She is a pretty badass shinobi. Just because she did not train in combat training like Naruto and Sasuke, she automatically gets hate. She has tremendous power, yes. That is an added bonus. But her speciality lies in the medical field. She becomes the head Medical person in Konoha. We didn\u2019t get to see 30 episodes of her training with Tsunade but the fact that she trained doesn\u2019t go away. She can summon the huge ass slug like both Sasuke and Naruto and while the boys fight up front, her battlefield is behind the scene. \nAlso, she loves Sasuke. Okay.. and??? So what? She loved him from Day 1 and is committed to the end. Let her be. Hypocrites criticize her loving Sasuke while saying Naruto-Hinata ship is cute. Fuck that. Sasuke Sakura have development and you actually get to see a relationship develop. Naruto and Hinata have honestly one of the most awkward relationship to ever exist. Let her be for simping on Sasuke. Anyone who uses that to hate on her is just reaching. \nShe grows. She grows from a sensitive, insecure whiny kid to a strong, powerful woman who handles herself, her family and the entire Medical dept. fuck all these unnecessary Sakura haters.",

Her childhood was \"normal\" until she went to an academy for future killers, then graduated and became a soldier at like 12/13. She didn't have to start off like naruto or Sasuke did but Kishimoto could've written her transition from school  girl to ninja a lot more smoother by like, actually giving her screen time that wasn't crying, and having her just immediately show the progress she's made (see:sarada) instead of having her whine/monolog \n\nYes she specializes in medical ninjutsu and that's cool and all but she's also combat trained as we see when she actually has fights. Again, she's just written really really fucking badly in 90% of the conflicts she finds herself in. \n\nDon't think the shipping hate really is that big of a deal considering how awful/forced the romance in the show is overall.",

Why do you agree on killing Sasuke and take a squad with you and then knock them out, so that you can kill him yourself? And you hesitate to kill because he might actually have feelings for you?

I don\u2019t know  how to use the feature you used to break up texts so I\u2019ll try my best lol \n\nYeah, she\u2019s poorly written. That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

But the people feared Gaara just the same as Naruto, it\u2019s just that Naruto never gave up trying to make friends (also yes, it helps that lord 3rd didn\u2019t actively put a hit out on Naruto).",

Lord 3rd knew this, he wouldn\u2019t let Naruto be on his own otherwise, so why let everyone hate him without letting him know why? That is just psychological torture. Why would the elders deside that having a young kid being hated by an entire village without him knowing why be a good idea?

                            "body": "I respectfully disagree for several reasons. The 2 never fought but there are several ways to estimate the power difference between them. \n\nFirstly, izuna, said to be equal in strength to madara (both superior to itachi), was defeated by tobirama and his flying raijin. It is well known that minato is faster and more powerful than tobirama, so let's consider it a win by proxy. \n\nSecondly, itachi said that fighting jiraiya would result in a draw in the best case scenario, more likely a loss. By jiraiya's own admission, minato was more proficient in his techniques than jiraiya himself, he even had trouble summoning gamabunta often times, something minato could do anytime he wanted. \n\nThirdly, the reason itachi is so powerful is because of his ocular techniques, unfortunately their biggest weakness is speed. The raikage is so fast that he cannot be put under genjutsu and not even a mangekyou can track his movements. Amaterasu can be dodged with speed as well. \nEven madara had to first immobilise the raikage before putting him under a genjutsu, and minato is much faster than him.\n\nEven if he did get hit by amaterasu, minato has the ability to teleport away from abilities that touch him, he did so during the war when he teleported away from amaterasu and kamui. \nHe can also teleport chakra using flying raijin (the bijuu ball), similar to a kamui, so him being able to teleport away parts of itachi's susanoo like the totsuka blade or yata mirror is not unthinkable. \n\nAdding to all of that, minato is a high level sensory type ninja who can use sage chakra. You cannot sneak up on him. If he is trapped in a genjutsu, he can get out with sage chakra. \n\nThe only way to defeat him is to be faster than him, and itachi is not. \n\nIf uchihas were paper, minato would be scissors.\n\nAlso he never got to his full potential since he died young. You could argue the same for itachi, but he was at the height (or near it) of his ocular prowess",

FTG made him able to teleport, sure he would win any speed based race, lmao. Also he is one of the most intelligent characters ever. Same as Itachi, he makes a plan in seconds and wins. And the only reason Itachi didn't beat Minato is because he didn't wanted to, he stayed longer there and did more fights unnecessary, just to test himself. Still was just a few seconds slower than Minato's record, who probably went straight to the finish and also teleported. But sure, let's dickride Minato, coz he is the best character ever, I love him too. But facts are facts. In terms of body movement speed, he isn't really special. He isn't faster than a regular Jounin. \n\nYou're actually right about most of the Uchihas. Itachi and Shisui are the only talents who are also Kage levels without the Sharingan. But they also rely on their power, but hey, that's what happens when you born with something strong. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIt's good to see that I made 20+ people mad with the truth. :D And the best part is that I never said Minato is weak, hell no, boi, he is ridiculously strong and has the best personality ever and also he is the best dad. <3 I luv him. :3 But just because he is the best and most loveable character, he isn't the strongest in the entire Narutoverse and the FTG doesn't makes him fast in terms of body movement. :)\n\nFacts are facts, deal with them. Dickriding Minato just because you love him, doesn't changes that in terms of body movement speed he isn't really special and there are faster characters than him.",

But then a couple of things au realized. \nAs kids, she had a normal childhood. Her family wasn\u2019t annihilated leaving her alone and cold. She doesn\u2019t have a raging beast in her that makes everyone hate her. Her biggest problem growing up was that she had a big forehead. And that she has a crush on a guy. If we just think about it, it is what girls her age worry about! There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. \nAlso, girls as a whole in Naruto have been downplayed IMO. Don\u2019t even get me started on the pathetic excuse that is Hinata Hyuga. Ad a Hyuga clan with Byakyugan, and Neji and the training, she had SO SO SO much badass potential but it went absolutely nowhere. I was so excited about her fight with Pain but it was over before it was even started. Ugh. Nevermind, coming back to the point. \nSakura was the one with the best chakra control and she utilizes that well. She goes into medical ninjutsu which compliments her so much. She turns out to be one of the best medical ninjas. She even surpasses Tsunade. She has a huge role in the war helping replenish the chakras, and she is actually pretty amazing at what she does. She has also saved the main characters a bunch of times. She is a pretty badass shinobi. Just because she did not train in combat training like Naruto and Sasuke, she automatically gets hate. She has tremendous power, yes. That is an added bonus. But her speciality lies in the medical field. She becomes the head Medical person in Konoha. We didn\u2019t get to see 30 episodes of her training with Tsunade but the fact that she trained doesn\u2019t go away. She can summon the huge ass slug like both Sasuke and Naruto and while the boys fight up front, her battlefield is behind the scene. \nAlso, she loves Sasuke. Okay.. and??? So what? She loved him from Day 1 and is committed to the end. Let her be. Hypocrites criticize her loving Sasuke while saying Naruto-Hinata ship is cute. Fuck that. Sasuke Sakura have development and you actually get to see a relationship develop. Naruto and Hinata have honestly one of the most awkward relationship to ever exist. Let her be for simping on Sasuke. Anyone who uses that to hate on her is just reaching. \nShe grows. She grows from a sensitive, insecure whiny kid to a strong, powerful woman who handles herself, her family and the entire Medical dept. fuck all these unnecessary Sakura haters.",

Her childhood was \"normal\" until she went to an academy for future killers, then graduated and became a soldier at like 12/13. She didn't have to start off like naruto or Sasuke did but Kishimoto could've written her transition from school  girl to ninja a lot more smoother by like, actually giving her screen time that wasn't crying, and having her just immediately show the progress she's made (see:sarada) instead of having her whine/monolog \n\nYes she specializes in medical ninjutsu and that's cool and all but she's also combat trained as we see when she actually has fights. Again, she's just written really really fucking badly in 90% of the conflicts she finds herself in. \n\nDon't think the shipping hate really is that big of a deal considering how awful/forced the romance in the show is overall.",

You need someone behind you to fight someone?,why do you keep punching Naruto for no good reason? For comedy? naah, why do you still want to marry a guy who tried to kill you like 3 times? Why do you agree on killing Sasuke and take a squad with you and then knock them out, so that you can kill him yourself? And you hesitate to kill because he might actually have feelings for you? Her lack of decision making, too many tsundere moments, boasting shit like 'I've caught up to these two' etc is what makes me hate her.",

I don\u2019t know  how to use the feature you used to break up texts so I\u2019ll try my best lol \n\nYeah, she\u2019s poorly written. That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

                    "body": "I respectfully disagree for several reasons. The 2 never fought but there are several ways to estimate the power difference between them. \n\nFirstly, izuna, said to be equal in strength to madara (both superior to itachi), was defeated by tobirama and his flying raijin. It is well known that minato is faster and more powerful than tobirama, so let's consider it a win by proxy. \n\nSecondly, itachi said that fighting jiraiya would result in a draw in the best case scenario, more likely a loss. By jiraiya's own admission, minato was more proficient in his techniques than jiraiya himself, he even had trouble summoning gamabunta often times, something minato could do anytime he wanted. \n\nThirdly, the reason itachi is so powerful is because of his ocular techniques, unfortunately their biggest weakness is speed. The raikage is so fast that he cannot be put under genjutsu and not even a mangekyou can track his movements. Amaterasu can be dodged with speed as well. \nEven madara had to first immobilise the raikage before putting him under a genjutsu, and minato is much faster than him.\n\nEven if he did get hit by amaterasu, minato has the ability to teleport away from abilities that touch him, he did so during the war when he teleported away from amaterasu and kamui. \nHe can also teleport chakra using flying raijin (the bijuu ball), similar to a kamui, so him being able to teleport away parts of itachi's susanoo like the totsuka blade or yata mirror is not unthinkable. \n\nAdding to all of that, minato is a high level sensory type ninja who can use sage chakra. You cannot sneak up on him. If he is trapped in a genjutsu, he can get out with sage chakra. \n\nThe only way to defeat him is to be faster than him, and itachi is not. \n\nIf uchihas were paper, minato would be scissors.\n\nAlso he never got to his full potential since he died young. You could argue the same for itachi, but he was at the height (or near it) of his ocular prowess",

FTG made him able to teleport, sure he would win any speed based race, lmao. Also he is one of the most intelligent characters ever. Same as Itachi, he makes a plan in seconds and wins. And the only reason Itachi didn't beat Minato is because he didn't wanted to, he stayed longer there and did more fights unnecessary, just to test himself. Still was just a few seconds slower than Minato's record, who probably went straight to the finish and also teleported. But sure, let's dickride Minato, coz he is the best character ever, I love him too. But facts are facts. In terms of body movement speed, he isn't really special. He isn't faster than a regular Jounin. \n\nYou're actually right about most of the Uchihas. Itachi and Shisui are the only talents who are also Kage levels without the Sharingan. But they also rely on their power, but hey, that's what happens when you born with something strong. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIt's good to see that I made 20+ people mad with the truth. :D And the best part is that I never said Minato is weak, hell no, boi, he is ridiculously strong and has the best personality ever and also he is the best dad. <3 I luv him. :3 But just because he is the best and most loveable character, he isn't the strongest in the entire Narutoverse and the FTG doesn't makes him fast in terms of body movement. :)\n\nFacts are facts, deal with them.

He isn't faster than a regular Jounin. \n\nSo being able to outspeed all of the hokage without using FLG makes you not faster than a regular JOUNIN \n\n>FTG doesn't makes him fast in terms of body movement. :)\n\nAnd I agree with that in more shows his reaction times but he's still fast without it because he didn't use it to get to the fourth war battlefield and he was still able to make it before anyone else",

Her childhood was \"normal\" until she went to an academy for future killers, then graduated and became a soldier at like 12/13. She didn't have to start off like naruto or Sasuke did but Kishimoto could've written her transition from school  girl to ninja a lot more smoother by like, actually giving her screen time that wasn't crying, and having her just immediately show the progress she's made (see:sarada) instead of having her whine/monolog \n\nYes she specializes in medical ninjutsu and that's cool and all but she's also combat trained as we see when she actually has fights. Again, she's just written really really fucking badly in 90% of the conflicts she finds herself in. \n\nDon't think the shipping hate really is that big of a deal considering how awful/forced the romance in the show is overall.",

Why do you agree on killing Sasuke and take a squad with you and then knock them out, so that you can kill him yourself? And you hesitate to kill because he might actually have feelings for you? Her lack of decision making, too many tsundere moments, boasting shit like 'I've caught up to these two' etc is what makes me hate her.",

I don\u2019t know  how to use the feature you used to break up texts so I\u2019ll try my best lol \n\nYeah, she\u2019s poorly written. That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

Why would the elders deside that having a young kid being hated by an entire village without him knowing why be a good idea?

            "body": "I respectfully disagree for several reasons. The 2 never fought but there are several ways to estimate the power difference between them. \n\nFirstly, izuna, said to be equal in strength to madara (both superior to itachi), was defeated by tobirama and his flying raijin. It is well known that minato is faster and more powerful than tobirama, so let's consider it a win by proxy. \n\nSecondly, itachi said that fighting jiraiya would result in a draw in the best case scenario, more likely a loss. By jiraiya's own admission, minato was more proficient in his techniques than jiraiya himself, he even had trouble summoning gamabunta often times, something minato could do anytime he wanted. \n\nThirdly, the reason itachi is so powerful is because of his ocular techniques, unfortunately their biggest weakness is speed. The raikage is so fast that he cannot be put under genjutsu and not even a mangekyou can track his movements. Amaterasu can be dodged with speed as well. \nEven madara had to first immobilise the raikage before putting him under a genjutsu, and minato is much faster than him.\n\nEven if he did get hit by amaterasu, minato has the ability to teleport away from abilities that touch him, he did so during the war when he teleported away from amaterasu and kamui. \nHe can also teleport chakra using flying raijin (the bijuu ball), similar to a kamui, so him being able to teleport away parts of itachi's susanoo like the totsuka blade or yata mirror is not unthinkable. \n\nAdding to all of that, minato is a high level sensory type ninja who can use sage chakra. You cannot sneak up on him. If he is trapped in a genjutsu, he can get out with sage chakra. \n\nThe only way to defeat him is to be faster than him, and itachi is not. \n\nIf uchihas were paper, minato would be scissors.\n\nAlso he never got to his full potential since he died young. You could argue the same for itachi, but he was at the height (or near it) of his ocular prowess",

He isn't faster than a regular Jounin. \n\nSo being able to outspeed all of the hokage without using FLG makes you not faster than a regular JOUNIN \n\n>FTG doesn't makes him fast in terms of body movement. :)\n\nAnd I agree with that in more shows his reaction times but he's still fast without it because he didn't use it to get to the fourth war battlefield and he was still able to make it before anyone else",

You need someone behind you to fight someone?,why do you keep punching Naruto for no good reason? For comedy? naah, why do you still want to marry a guy who tried to kill you like 3 times? Why do you agree on killing Sasuke and take a squad with you and then knock them out, so that you can kill him yourself? And you hesitate to kill because he might actually have feelings for you? Her lack of decision making, too many tsundere moments, boasting shit like 'I've caught up to these two' etc is what makes me hate her.",

I don\u2019t know  how to use the feature you used to break up texts so I\u2019ll try my best lol \n\nYeah, she\u2019s poorly written. That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

Lord 3rd knew this, he wouldn\u2019t let Naruto be on his own otherwise, so why let everyone hate him without letting him know why? That is just psychological torture. Why would the elders deside that having a young kid being hated by an entire village without him knowing why be a good idea?

You need someone behind you to fight someone?,why do you keep punching Naruto for no good reason? For comedy? naah, why do you still want to marry a guy who tried to kill you like 3 times? Why do you agree on killing Sasuke and take a squad with you and then knock them out, so that you can kill him yourself? And you hesitate to kill because he might actually have feelings for you? Her lack of decision making, too many tsundere moments, boasting shit like 'I've caught up to these two' etc is what makes me hate her.",

I don\u2019t know  how to use the feature you used to break up texts so I\u2019ll try my best lol \n\nYeah, she\u2019s poorly written. That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

Why would the elders deside that having a young kid being hated by an entire village without him knowing why be a good idea?

That\u2019s a fact, but we all know Kishimoto can\u2019t write women. So you really don\u2019t have to use that as an argument. \n\nShe was a bitch at the start of the series, that\u2019s a fact as well. But she got character development. As we all might know, that\u2019s a thing. Honestly her personality changed and I like it. \n\nAye, everyone has their own flaws, right? I don\u2019t see people hating on any character when they failed to do something? Right? Apart from her not being able to stab an eye, she has lots of accomplishments. Also, in the manga, she only had one panel, therefore its hard to determine whether she had time. And here\u2019s my look on it; she isn\u2019t faster than 10 tails Madara, is she? So I don\u2019t see how she was supposed to stab it. \n\nYour argument on punching Naruto...what even is this? It\u2019s clearly for comedic purposes so whether you like it or not, it\u2019s not a reason to bash her. Literally every shonen has a female character punching the mc but nobody is hating on them. \n\nYeah, she loves Sasuke. But she can\u2019t help it? Oh please, I guarantee that if she\u2019d be able to change something, that would be definitely her love for him. Kakashi himself stated that Sakura is suffering from loving Sasuke. She even tried to kill him. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t understand her character and focus on what she says, never asking yourself, why she says that? \n\nShe said \u201cI finally caught up with these two\u201d because she can finally battle with them side to side without getting left out. She never meant it literally as if she can compare herself to literal Demi gods. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re smarter than that dude.",

Lord 3rd knew this, he wouldn\u2019t let Naruto be on his own otherwise, so why let everyone hate him without letting him know why? That is just psychological torture. Why would the elders deside that having a young kid being hated by an entire village without him knowing why be a good idea? I am not saying that he wasn\u2019t already a threat to the village because he definetly was but the way the dealt with the situation was definetly bad. They were lucky that he eventually found people willing to help him",
