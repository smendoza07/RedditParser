Then again, not like he needed really advanced elemntal jutsus in that fight.\n\nIf kishi write it **or** said it's continuation of his story then yes, it's canon. The movie The Last might be canon, casue Kishi went a lot of his way to say he supported that movie a lot. (which can't be said for novels)\n\nHe doesn't own it but he is created of this series.\n\nIf Kishimoto looked at some random Naruto x Kiba fanfic and said it was canon, it'd be canon. Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",

(which can't be said for novels)\n\nHe doesn't own it but he is created of this series.\n\nIf Kishimoto looked at some random Naruto x Kiba fanfic and said it was canon, it'd be canon. Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",

But novels ignor that.\n\nNaruto had Six Paths Senjutsu but he just got it. It was new power to him, so it's rational that he coudn't use it right away from the start in full potential. Then again, not like he needed really advanced elemntal jutsus in that fight.\n\nIf kishi write it **or** said it's continuation of his story then yes, it's canon. The movie The Last might be canon, casue Kishi went a lot of his way to say he supported that movie a lot. (which can't be said for novels)\n\nHe doesn't own it but he is created of this series.\n\nIf Kishimoto looked at some random Naruto x Kiba fanfic and said it was canon, it'd be canon. Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",

But novels ignor that.\n\nNaruto had Six Paths Senjutsu but he just got it. It was new power to him, so it's rational that he coudn't use it right away from the start in full potential. Then again, not like he needed really advanced elemntal jutsus in that fight.\n\nIf kishi write it **or** said it's continuation of his story then yes, it's canon. The movie The Last might be canon, casue Kishi went a lot of his way to say he supported that movie a lot. (which can't be said for novels)\n\nHe doesn't own it but he is created of this series.\n\nIf Kishimoto looked at some random Naruto x Kiba fanfic and said it was canon, it'd be canon. Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",

Since he is, as you say different case then Sasuke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Madara didn't have it for much longer at that point either, he got it just before his fight with Gai.\n\nBut Madara was much more talented then Naruto.  For example, He mastered sage mode in seconds when he stealed it from Hashirama. Unlike Naruto who had to spent long time to master it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It was agreed that the shinden novels that take place during the blank period are canon. It was agreed by the studio heads and I assume Kishi had some say in the matter.\n\nOnly by studio head agreed. All Kishi did, that we know for certain is that he ilustrated the cover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Nobody said that the Naruto fillers are canon (besides the adaptations) so that's a completely moot point.\n\nWho said adaptations are canon?

But novels ignor that.\n\nNaruto had Six Paths Senjutsu but he just got it. It was new power to him, so it's rational that he coudn't use it right away from the start in full potential. Then again, not like he needed really advanced elemntal jutsus in that fight.\n\nIf kishi write it **or** said it's continuation of his story then yes, it's canon. The movie The Last might be canon, casue Kishi went a lot of his way to say he supported that movie a lot. (which can't be said for novels)\n\nHe doesn't own it but he is created of this series.\n\nIf Kishimoto looked at some random Naruto x Kiba fanfic and said it was canon, it'd be canon. Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",

Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",

But novels ignor that.\n\nNaruto had Six Paths Senjutsu but he just got it. It was new power to him, so it's rational that he coudn't use it right away from the start in full potential. Then again, not like he needed really advanced elemntal jutsus in that fight.\n\nIf kishi write it **or** said it's continuation of his story then yes, it's canon. The movie The Last might be canon, casue Kishi went a lot of his way to say he supported that movie a lot. (which can't be said for novels)\n\nHe doesn't own it but he is created of this series.\n\nIf Kishimoto looked at some random Naruto x Kiba fanfic and said it was canon, it'd be canon. Being a separately written story is not the same as not partaking in the same universe together. This isn't some subjective thought, this is actually how it works, we **tuned into Kishimoto's story**, and he gets to decide what happens in his story, regardless of whether he wrote it or not. \n\nIf that was not the case, then all filers in Naruto would be canon, cause people who made (ordered them to be made) them are owners of Naruto.",
