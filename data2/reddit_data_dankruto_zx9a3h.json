Yes, normal MS users eventually go blind, but he was obviously the exception because of his hasirama cells enhanced body. MS even takes a physical toll on the body when it\u2019s used, we saw so with Kakashi, Sasuke and Itschi, but Obito could spam his for hours without it taking a toll. He literally spammed it for 17 years. So no, he wasn\u2019t going blind at all.",

The powers were really just \"grab a kami from Shinto, imagine a suitable power for that kami, give it to an Uchiha.\" \n\nWe got: Amaterasu (sun goddess), Susanoo (storm god and killer of the serpent Orochi), Kagetsuchi (fire god), Tsukuyomi (moon goddess), Izanami and Izanagi (deities of creation and the parents of the previous entries in the last), kamui (a type of spiritual being), Kotoamatsukami (title given to the first few deities who came into existence). \n\nI think the author just wanted to tie the Uchiha to concepts of spirituality and divine power, really driving home that their eyes are associated with god-like beings like Kaguya and the Otsotsuki. \n\nReally this is like having a show in English where a main character comes from a family that has, I dunno, golden hands and feet that appear one by one as they suffer trauma. And initially the golden hands and feet just give things like dexterity and grip strength and durability, but then they start giving weird powers once all the limbs become even golder or something. And the powers are named stuff like \"Moses,\" which allows the user to manipulate the shape of water. Or \"Yeshua,\" which allows the user to multiply things they touch. Or \"Elisha,\" which lets the user summon animal spirits. Or \"David,\" which allows the wielder to charge up small objects to throw them with perfect accuracy at absurd speeds.",

But with the extra cultural context, it's \"Haha. Susanoo did the thing!\" It'd be like watching a movie from America where a villain named Goliath has a big reveal and looks ready to fuck shit up and another character named David just immediately takes him out by throwing a rock. To people not familiar with the biblical story, it'd seem like a weird thing to include. But to people in the know, it's \"Haha. David did the thing!\"",

They could have said Madara found some other way to revive himself from the tablet. Obito used it against Konan and if not for that we wouldn't have seen it used effectively since Danzo got his cheeks clapped repeatedly.\n\nThe main purpose of Izanagi was to represent an extreme cost for an Uchiha but for Danzo, he made a lot of other people pay the entry fee which also showed that the Uchiha were justified in attempting the coup.\n\nDanzo killing Shisui would be like if the CIA director offed a highly decorated and loyal special forces officer because organ upgrades were possible. And he already had a sharingan to use Izanagi before stealing Shisui's. Just who did he get it from?\n\nDo people who defend Itachi expect something like that to be ignored by any of the military, the MPs, and finally by this person's close cousins in the MPs, other military positions, and areas of economic power?",

Just like how Obito had two versions of Kamui.\n\nThe first and most famous was the 10 year cooldown, ultimate unbreakable genjutsu that Itachi used on himself to bypass the edo tensei. \n\nThe second one was a far weaker genjutsu that just inserted an idea into a person's head, making them think that they came up with it themselves.

The powers were really just \"grab a kami from Shinto, imagine a suitable power for that kami, give it to an Uchiha.\" \n\nWe got: Amaterasu (sun goddess), Susanoo (storm god and killer of the serpent Orochi), Kagetsuchi (fire god), Tsukuyomi (moon goddess), Izanami and Izanagi (deities of creation and the parents of the previous entries in the last), kamui (a type of spiritual being), Kotoamatsukami (title given to the first few deities who came into existence). \n\nI think the author just wanted to tie the Uchiha to concepts of spirituality and divine power, really driving home that their eyes are associated with god-like beings like Kaguya and the Otsotsuki. \n\nReally this is like having a show in English where a main character comes from a family that has, I dunno, golden hands and feet that appear one by one as they suffer trauma. And initially the golden hands and feet just give things like dexterity and grip strength and durability, but then they start giving weird powers once all the limbs become even golder or something. And the powers are named stuff like \"Moses,\" which allows the user to manipulate the shape of water. Or \"Yeshua,\" which allows the user to multiply things they touch. Or \"Elisha,\" which lets the user summon animal spirits. Or \"David,\" which allows the wielder to charge up small objects to throw them with perfect accuracy at absurd speeds.",

But with the extra cultural context, it's \"Haha. Susanoo did the thing!\" It'd be like watching a movie from America where a villain named Goliath has a big reveal and looks ready to fuck shit up and another character named David just immediately takes him out by throwing a rock. To people not familiar with the biblical story, it'd seem like a weird thing to include. But to people in the know, it's \"Haha. David did the thing!\"",

Just like how Obito had two versions of Kamui.\n\nThe first and most famous was the 10 year cooldown, ultimate unbreakable genjutsu that Itachi used on himself to bypass the edo tensei. \n\nThe second one was a far weaker genjutsu that just inserted an idea into a person's head, making them think that they came up with it themselves.

And initially the golden hands and feet just give things like dexterity and grip strength and durability, but then they start giving weird powers once all the limbs become even golder or something. And the powers are named stuff like \"Moses,\" which allows the user to manipulate the shape of water. Or \"Yeshua,\" which allows the user to multiply things they touch. Or \"Elisha,\" which lets the user summon animal spirits. Or \"David,\" which allows the wielder to charge up small objects to throw them with perfect accuracy at absurd speeds.",

That entire sequence was basically Kishimoto depicting the mythical slaying of Orochi by Susanoo. \n\nIt feels kinda jarring without that context because it just looks like Orochimaru showed up to get stabbed once. But with the extra cultural context, it's \"Haha. Susanoo did the thing!\" It'd be like watching a movie from America where a villain named Goliath has a big reveal and looks ready to fuck shit up and another character named David just immediately takes him out by throwing a rock. To people not familiar with the biblical story, it'd seem like a weird thing to include. But to people in the know, it's \"Haha. David did the thing!\"",

The powers were really just \"grab a kami from Shinto, imagine a suitable power for that kami, give it to an Uchiha.\" \n\nWe got: Amaterasu (sun goddess), Susanoo (storm god and killer of the serpent Orochi), Kagetsuchi (fire god), Tsukuyomi (moon goddess), Izanami and Izanagi (deities of creation and the parents of the previous entries in the last), kamui (a type of spiritual being), Kotoamatsukami (title given to the first few deities who came into existence). \n\nI think the author just wanted to tie the Uchiha to concepts of spirituality and divine power, really driving home that their eyes are associated with god-like beings like Kaguya and the Otsotsuki. \n\nReally this is like having a show in English where a main character comes from a family that has, I dunno, golden hands and feet that appear one by one as they suffer trauma. And initially the golden hands and feet just give things like dexterity and grip strength and durability, but then they start giving weird powers once all the limbs become even golder or something. And the powers are named stuff like \"Moses,\" which allows the user to manipulate the shape of water. Or \"Yeshua,\" which allows the user to multiply things they touch. Or \"Elisha,\" which lets the user summon animal spirits. Or \"David,\" which allows the wielder to charge up small objects to throw them with perfect accuracy at absurd speeds.",

Just like how Obito had two versions of Kamui.\n\nThe first and most famous was the 10 year cooldown, ultimate unbreakable genjutsu that Itachi used on himself to bypass the edo tensei. \n\nThe second one was a far weaker genjutsu that just inserted an idea into a person's head, making them think that they came up with it themselves.

Yes, normal MS users eventually go blind, but he was obviously the exception because of his hasirama cells enhanced body. MS even takes a physical toll on the body when it\u2019s used, we saw so with Kakashi, Sasuke and Itschi, but Obito could spam his for hours without it taking a toll. He literally spammed it for 17 years. So no, he wasn\u2019t going blind at all.",

But with the extra cultural context, it's \"Haha. Susanoo did the thing!\" It'd be like watching a movie from America where a villain named Goliath has a big reveal and looks ready to fuck shit up and another character named David just immediately takes him out by throwing a rock. To people not familiar with the biblical story, it'd seem like a weird thing to include. But to people in the know, it's \"Haha. David did the thing!\"",

Yes, normal MS users eventually go blind, but he was obviously the exception because of his hasirama cells enhanced body. MS even takes a physical toll on the body when it\u2019s used, we saw so with Kakashi, Sasuke and Itschi, but Obito could spam his for hours without it taking a toll. He literally spammed it for 17 years. So no, he wasn\u2019t going blind at all.",
