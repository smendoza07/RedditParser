I take offense at being called an idiot without reading comprehension just because I wasn't familiar with an uncommon practice most people in the world most likely don't engage in. I would have deduced a phrase like summer home but the fact that you used place made it confusing to me. Like what is this place and why is it reserved for summer. Not being familiar with the concept all I can deduce is that you were talking about a location and a season. That still doesn't explain what people do there. Is it a summer camp? Is it like some religious retreat? I guess people live there but why are there multiple families living in the same dwelling for a season? Vacation home might be more straight forward but why is this place reserved only for summer? Can you not vacation there in the winter? Is it even a vacation thing or do people just move for a season? How do you keep a job if you move away for a season? Why are you such an asshole?",

Closest related phenomena I see is retired people who come down for the winter. Which makes sense to me since they are usually retired and I guess living in the cold sucks. I don't even go outside in the summer if I can help it. So I guess there are people that have a second home to escape the winter and some other people have a second home to enjoy the summer. Sounds like a pretty cool thing to do.",

I take offense at being called an idiot without reading comprehension just because I wasn't familiar with an uncommon practice most people in the world most likely don't engage in. I would have deduced a phrase like summer home but the fact that you used place made it confusing to me. Like what is this place and why is it reserved for summer. Not being familiar with the concept all I can deduce is that you were talking about a location and a season. That still doesn't explain what people do there. Is it a summer camp? Is it like some religious retreat? I guess people live there but why are there multiple families living in the same dwelling for a season? Vacation home might be more straight forward but why is this place reserved only for summer? Can you not vacation there in the winter? Is it even a vacation thing or do people just move for a season? How do you keep a job if you move away for a season? Why are you such an asshole?",

Closest related phenomena I see is retired people who come down for the winter. Which makes sense to me since they are usually retired and I guess living in the cold sucks. I don't even go outside in the summer if I can help it. So I guess there are people that have a second home to escape the winter and some other people have a second home to enjoy the summer.

I take offense at being called an idiot without reading comprehension just because I wasn't familiar with an uncommon practice most people in the world most likely don't engage in. I would have deduced a phrase like summer home but the fact that you used place made it confusing to me. Like what is this place and why is it reserved for summer. Not being familiar with the concept all I can deduce is that you were talking about a location and a season. That still doesn't explain what people do there. Is it a summer camp? Is it like some religious retreat? I guess people live there but why are there multiple families living in the same dwelling for a season? Vacation home might be more straight forward but why is this place reserved only for summer? Can you not vacation there in the winter? Is it even a vacation thing or do people just move for a season? How do you keep a job if you move away for a season? Why are you such an asshole?",

Closest related phenomena I see is retired people who come down for the winter. Which makes sense to me since they are usually retired and I guess living in the cold sucks. I don't even go outside in the summer if I can help it. So I guess there are people that have a second home to escape the winter and some other people have a second home to enjoy the summer. Sounds like a pretty cool thing to do.",

I take offense at being called an idiot without reading comprehension just because I wasn't familiar with an uncommon practice most people in the world most likely don't engage in. I would have deduced a phrase like summer home but the fact that you used place made it confusing to me. Like what is this place and why is it reserved for summer. Not being familiar with the concept all I can deduce is that you were talking about a location and a season. That still doesn't explain what people do there. Is it a summer camp? Is it like some religious retreat? I guess people live there but why are there multiple families living in the same dwelling for a season? Vacation home might be more straight forward but why is this place reserved only for summer? Can you not vacation there in the winter? Is it even a vacation thing or do people just move for a season? How do you keep a job if you move away for a season? Why are you such an asshole?",

Closest related phenomena I see is retired people who come down for the winter. Which makes sense to me since they are usually retired and I guess living in the cold sucks. I don't even go outside in the summer if I can help it. So I guess there are people that have a second home to escape the winter and some other people have a second home to enjoy the summer. Sounds like a pretty cool thing to do.",

I take offense at being called an idiot without reading comprehension just because I wasn't familiar with an uncommon practice most people in the world most likely don't engage in. I would have deduced a phrase like summer home but the fact that you used place made it confusing to me. Like what is this place and why is it reserved for summer. Not being familiar with the concept all I can deduce is that you were talking about a location and a season. That still doesn't explain what people do there. Is it a summer camp? Is it like some religious retreat? I guess people live there but why are there multiple families living in the same dwelling for a season? Vacation home might be more straight forward but why is this place reserved only for summer? Can you not vacation there in the winter? Is it even a vacation thing or do people just move for a season? How do you keep a job if you move away for a season? Why are you such an asshole?",

Closest related phenomena I see is retired people who come down for the winter. Which makes sense to me since they are usually retired and I guess living in the cold sucks. I don't even go outside in the summer if I can help it. So I guess there are people that have a second home to escape the winter and some other people have a second home to enjoy the summer. Sounds like a pretty cool thing to do.",

I take offense at being called an idiot without reading comprehension just because I wasn't familiar with an uncommon practice most people in the world most likely don't engage in. I would have deduced a phrase like summer home but the fact that you used place made it confusing to me. Like what is this place and why is it reserved for summer. Not being familiar with the concept all I can deduce is that you were talking about a location and a season. That still doesn't explain what people do there. Is it a summer camp? Is it like some religious retreat? I guess people live there but why are there multiple families living in the same dwelling for a season? Vacation home might be more straight forward but why is this place reserved only for summer? Can you not vacation there in the winter? Is it even a vacation thing or do people just move for a season? How do you keep a job if you move away for a season? Why are you such an asshole?",

            "body": "Thanks for the answer. I'm from Florida, I don't even know what winterized means. Closest related phenomena I see is retired people who come down for the winter. Which makes sense to me since they are usually retired and I guess living in the cold sucks. I don't even go outside in the summer if I can help it. So I guess there are people that have a second home to escape the winter and some other people have a second home to enjoy the summer. Sounds like a pretty cool thing to do.",
