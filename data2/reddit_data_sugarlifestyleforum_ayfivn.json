That said, you should have at least some public photos -- even if they don't include your face.\n\nAlso, people pick up different tones when they read.  While the notion of not giving access to private pics until there's been a little bit of a conversation is totally reasonable and understandable (and, in fact, is my policy, too), the way you worded it comes off as... I dunno, a bit churlish, and the smiley face at the end isn't fooling anyone.  I've found \"Would you mind if we exchanged a couple of messages before exchanging private pics?  I've had some bad experiences and just want to make sure we're both for real first\", to be the winning approach to pic requestors so far (and I've tried out a LOT of things).  Which doesn't mean that particular guy won't still be an asshole ... just that it's worth addressing what's in your control.
