    "body": "I just recently had sex for the first time with my SD and he kept commenting on the fact that I have large labia and saying I have an ugly slutty whore vagina and it was clear that I have had sex with a lot of men and anyone who asks (I have only had sex with my ex-BF. I am 18 since January and in HS. I have almost no experience). It made me feel so so bad and like i can never have sex again even though I am just built like this. I don't understand why he thinks the way my vagina looks means I am a bad girl.\n\nHe says he might see me again but only for 1/3 of my allowance per time. I don't know what to say to him or how or if to tell him I am not like he says. He also asked for part of the money bacl because he was so disgusted and couldnt get hard even though it seemed like he was hard and definitely had an orgasm. And now I think I will be sad forever. And I need yte money but I don't think I can do this and now I kind of want to die.",

Typical entitled stupid pig of a man, DEF not SD material. He's manipulating you,  some dudes get off on knocking females down. \n\nHe sounds like trouble. Next time he hits you up (do NOT contact him yourself, I recommend), just tell him something like this:\nnow that you've had some time to go over things, you've made the decision that HE has an ugly, stinky, repulsivelt filthy d*ck, that by the way, doesn't end up stanking like that unless it \"gets around\", \nand that if HE wants to see YOU again, it's not gonna be worth your time unless you're charging TRIPLE the originally agreed upon amount (and even if he agrees to it, DON'T do it. This is strictly for YOUR own confirmation/closure when you find out just how fragile his cheap little ego is after he either \na) gets all sensitive in response or \nb) lashes out with more empty insults after he realizes that touch\u00e9, 2 can play this game,  and he's lost this one. \nWhat would be even better is if he agrees to that 3x arrangement, and then you can set up your next meeting with him that you \"can't wait for\", & then *POOF* ya ghost him....and then block the number, and never ever speak to him again.... make sure you screen well, too, since trash like him enjoy playing mindgames & he might try contacting you from a new profile. That might teach him not to spew that dumb sh*t to the next one,  but probably not,  and that's okay... you've done your due diligence & spanked his ego while he preps for the next one, with the new things to be insecure about himself). \n\nSeriously F that, he doesn't get to make the \"new rules\" after you've both settled on an agreement. And if he never hits you up again, then PRAISE JEEBUS, crisis averted.  \n\nOn the other hand, if he does try to come at you again with another spell of condescending BS to spew, do yourself, your confidence, & your dignity a favor & repeat something like what I outlined above. I promise,  you'll feel like a million bucks going from questioning your own anatomy to realizing he's a total douch & treating him as such. \n\nSorry baby girl but he just ain't worth your time. If you're doing the sugar thing, you're looking for a much higher caliber of man that realizes that YOU are the asset, YOU are the arm candy for him. NOT the other way around. \nRemember: You did NOT go to all this trouble to create a profile & be the ASSET for this, or any other pathetic loser to \n\u25cfcheapen your value\n\u25cfinsult you into questioning your own body \u25cfbargain your time down to what he wishes he could offer to see someone like you for the wonderful service that I'm sure any other SD would be LUCKY to have & not only KNOWS THAT but also MAKES YOU feel as such. Otherwise honestly, what's the fucking point??? Honestly. \n\nHe or any other \"SD\" that acts like that is only trying to take advantage of the fact that you're only 18 (that's why MANY much older men are going to be attracted to a \"barely legal adult\" by the way, so keep that in mind going forward) and try to get you to bend on your own rules, give freebies, and let him get away with it. If it feels wrong, he's probably trying to groom you.  \n\nP.S. you are WAY too young for this shit, if you want your REAL love life to have some genuine butterflies & spunk beyond just a financial incentive & that's it,  I would wait until you are AT LEAST 22, if not 25, when you have a bit more life experience & aren't going to question yourself and your goodies any time some thirsty ass, cheap punk ass fake \"sugardaddy\" wants to condescend you down to a cheaper rate. He's an insult to all the LEGIT SDs out there, and any real gent will tell you as much. Try not to dwell on talking about this bad experience with any future SDs either, don't expose your vulnerabilities like that right away or ever,  because it just makes it that much easier for them to potentially exploit your inexperience, which is not your fault. Just be careful & if you aren't having the time of your life,  THANK U, NEXT! You're 18 years old, and practically virginal....... you ARE the asset, and YOU GOT THIS. \nJust my 2 cents. Either way,  good luck girl!",

Look into what kind of scholarships Emory offers, and what kind are for your background, (ex. your ethnicity, if you're the first in your family to go to college, if you have immigrant parents, etc.) your major/field, your hobbies/interests/skills, and even physical traits. (ex. height, being left-handed, etc.) There are also scholarship contests you can win by writing essays or completing a challenge, etc.   \nTalk to your guidance counselor at school and to the financial aid office at Emory, and and see what they recommend to you. Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you. Even if they're small, a few $500 or $1000 ones can really add up and make a big impact.   \nPlus some schools are offering emergency Covid relief funds, see if Emory is. I've gotten a bit over $2k in emergency relief funds from mine this academic year. It's not a ton of money, but every bit counts and it helps.",

Did you ever see bridgerton? Remember how her mother didn\u2019t even teach her a single thing about sex before she gets sent away? That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re descended from. The more you know, the happier, safer and more independent you can be. \n\nOn that topic though, make sure you are super acquainted with your own too. Vaginas are not static, especially if you\u2019re on a non hormonal bc or no bc. The more you know about yours now (looks, likes, dislikes etc) the more comfortable you\u2019ll be long term. Also 1000% learn how to *enjoy* making yourself cum. It will improve your sex life and your standards. You\u2019re exactly what\u2019s normal for your age so don\u2019t feel bad, but learning and practicing these things will drastically improve your experiences with men and set you up for success sooner. And in the bowl you meet people more experienced than you so it\u2019s good to be prepared <3",

The world is *riddled* with men commenting on women with larger labia when they're wearing tight clothing (swimsuits, leggings, ect ) and saying things like, \"she has a dick\". For years I didn't want men to go down on me or even look at me naked because of it. It still messes with my head some times. \nDo not let it get to you. \nThere are, what, 4 billion women in this planet, and all of our vaginas looks different. \nWould I like a nicely packaged one? That'd be cool. I wear nothing but tight clothing and the front wedgies are ridiculous. But it's not worth it to me to get surgery for it. \nAnyone who puts you down for it is a piece of shit. They probably learned all about women from porn, which we all know isn't realistic. \nOnce I finally wrapped my head around that my body is FINE, I've brought it up with so many lovers, and just friends I'm open with, and the general consensus is that bigger labia is nice a juicy. Not everyone is going to find it appealing, but no one is attractive to everyone. \nYou find a man who loves that labia, and sit on his face like mothra attacking a city!",

(ex. height, being left-handed, etc.) There are also scholarship contests you can win by writing essays or completing a challenge, etc.   \nTalk to your guidance counselor at school and to the financial aid office at Emory, and and see what they recommend to you. Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you. Even if they're small, a few $500 or $1000 ones can really add up and make a big impact.   \nPlus some schools are offering emergency Covid relief funds, see if Emory is. I've gotten a bit over $2k in emergency relief funds from mine this academic year. It's not a ton of money, but every bit counts and it helps.",

                    "body": "Most young women haven\u2019t! It\u2019s a shame because the isolation puts us at a disadvantage and the brutal truth is that men will use that against you. And then once you know better men will be rude to you and a not want to hang around you. That\u2019s ok though because those men are not good potential partners or sds. Don\u2019t waste time on them. Did you ever see bridgerton? Remember how her mother didn\u2019t even teach her a single thing about sex before she gets sent away? That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re descended from. The more you know, the happier, safer and more independent you can be. \n\nOn that topic though, make sure you are super acquainted with your own too. Vaginas are not static, especially if you\u2019re on a non hormonal bc or no bc. The more you know about yours now (looks, likes, dislikes etc) the more comfortable you\u2019ll be long term. Also 1000% learn how to *enjoy* making yourself cum. It will improve your sex life and your standards. You\u2019re exactly what\u2019s normal for your age so don\u2019t feel bad, but learning and practicing these things will drastically improve your experiences with men and set you up for success sooner. And in the bowl you meet people more experienced than you so it\u2019s good to be prepared <3",

(ex. height, being left-handed, etc.) There are also scholarship contests you can win by writing essays or completing a challenge, etc.   \nTalk to your guidance counselor at school and to the financial aid office at Emory, and and see what they recommend to you. Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you. Even if they're small, a few $500 or $1000 ones can really add up and make a big impact.   \nPlus some schools are offering emergency Covid relief funds, see if Emory is. I've gotten a bit over $2k in emergency relief funds from mine this academic year. It's not a ton of money, but every bit counts and it helps.",

Did you ever see bridgerton? Remember how her mother didn\u2019t even teach her a single thing about sex before she gets sent away? That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re descended from. The more you know, the happier, safer and more independent you can be. \n\nOn that topic though, make sure you are super acquainted with your own too. Vaginas are not static, especially if you\u2019re on a non hormonal bc or no bc. The more you know about yours now (looks, likes, dislikes etc) the more comfortable you\u2019ll be long term. Also 1000% learn how to *enjoy* making yourself cum. It will improve your sex life and your standards. You\u2019re exactly what\u2019s normal for your age so don\u2019t feel bad, but learning and practicing these things will drastically improve your experiences with men and set you up for success sooner. And in the bowl you meet people more experienced than you so it\u2019s good to be prepared <3",

(ex. height, being left-handed, etc.) There are also scholarship contests you can win by writing essays or completing a challenge, etc.   \nTalk to your guidance counselor at school and to the financial aid office at Emory, and and see what they recommend to you. Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you. Even if they're small, a few $500 or $1000 ones can really add up and make a big impact.   \nPlus some schools are offering emergency Covid relief funds, see if Emory is. I've gotten a bit over $2k in emergency relief funds from mine this academic year. It's not a ton of money, but every bit counts and it helps.",

(ex. height, being left-handed, etc.) There are also scholarship contests you can win by writing essays or completing a challenge, etc.   \nTalk to your guidance counselor at school and to the financial aid office at Emory, and and see what they recommend to you. Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you. Even if they're small, a few $500 or $1000 ones can really add up and make a big impact.   \nPlus some schools are offering emergency Covid relief funds, see if Emory is. I've gotten a bit over $2k in emergency relief funds from mine this academic year. It's not a ton of money, but every bit counts and it helps.",

Why would you think you\u2019re the problem if his body is literally showing you that he\u2019s lying and enjoyed it. \n\nIt\u2019s 2022. You need to do more research on sex and realize nobody cares about how many partners youve had. You speak as if it\u2019s the 1960s. It\u2019s a little odd. Like we\u2019re you homeschooled and isolated or something? \n\nEnjoy college. Make memories. Sleep with more guys your age. Sugaring is not for you, at least right now.

(ex. height, being left-handed, etc.) There are also scholarship contests you can win by writing essays or completing a challenge, etc.   \nTalk to your guidance counselor at school and to the financial aid office at Emory, and and see what they recommend to you. Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you. Even if they're small, a few $500 or $1000 ones can really add up and make a big impact.   \nPlus some schools are offering emergency Covid relief funds, see if Emory is.

Your counselor or the financial aid office may know of some good scholarship/grant databases or what kind of scholarships/grants would fit you.
