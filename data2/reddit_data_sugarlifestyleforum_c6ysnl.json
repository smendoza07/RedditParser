    "body": "Maybe it was fate because my plans with a guy I\u2019m vanilla hooking up with didn\u2019t pan out. \n\nFor the first time I messaged someone who was a new user on the site. I never do this because I usually suspect that they\u2019re a scammer or a flaker. I messaged the guy and was shocked to get a response. I\u2019ve been having a little dry spell on the site lately. \n\nWe chatted a little bit and the conversation was going great so we decided to exchange numbers. That\u2019s when we found out that we\u2019re both from New York (area codes). That made me more interested because I haven\u2019t met anyone from NY in the year I\u2019ve lived in So Cal.\n\nSo we texted and there was an instant chemistry. He asked me out for dinner that same night. I was looking at the time and was reluctant because I usually wait a while before meeting but something told me to just go. So I managed to shower, dress, get done up, and pop on my new customized wig that\u2019s been dying to be worn. I was shocked how I did all this within an hour. \n\nI met him at Mastro\u2019s Steakhouse. It was the best luxury dining experience. Totally new for me and totally what I\u2019m looking for in regards to meeting someone who puts me on to things I\u2019m not used to. He was at the max of my age range but it didn\u2019t matter because he had a youthful energy and I found myself attracted to him as soon as I heard his voice when he greeted me.\n\nAnyway, we had the best conversation. It was so natural and pleasant that I didn\u2019t even discuss the arrangement or terms or money. He was so knowledgeable about the food and wine and it was pretty hot how the staff was doting on him and I because of his connections. He even got the restaurant to keep the kitchen open later. \n\nEnd of the date he slipped me a generous monetary gift in my purse for showing up and being great. He said meeting me was a breath of fresh air compared to his other meet and greets and he feels safe with me since I\u2019m \u201cnormal\u201d lol. He had a meet and greet planned for later today and is cancelling it to see me again.\n\nI think I\u2019ve found the one.\n\n*Also, he did bring up what he\u2019s looking for specifically and basically what his allowance and lifestyle is like and it\u2019s more than what I was expecting so I\u2019m excited.*",

You have to wear the right colors and have a proper understanding of how a real sugar daddy can spot you. He makes the approach (generally in real life, not online). He knows what to say to get you interested. If he's a real sugar daddy he will make sure you know that he is one. Then you can start to be more verbal with him.\n\nI had one lady who put herself precisely in my vicinity, opened up a dialogue and within five minutes she knew the deal. Gave me her phone number unhesitatingly. That one had experience, i could tell. \n\nThis other girl just outright started crying about some airfare issue where she was going to not get her money refunded. I knew she was a little bit scammy but her technique was obvious so i exploited her for it. We both got what we wanted so it's all good.\n\nThe biggest mistake a lot of younger women make is to not be very honest about what type of guy they want. That just wastes everyones time.\n\nOnline isnt so effective unless you have lots of youtube vids of yourself because most online sugar babies arent women and most authentic sugar dads already know this.",

Then you can start to be more verbal with him.\n\nI had one lady who put herself precisely in my vicinity, opened up a dialogue and within five minutes she knew the deal. Gave me her phone number unhesitatingly.
