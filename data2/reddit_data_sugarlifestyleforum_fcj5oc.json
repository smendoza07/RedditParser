    "body": "From what I hear there should be lots of vacancies on cruises coming up.  We need sugar themed cruises where SBs and SDs can meet and get to know each other, maybe NYC sugar cruise, LA sugar cruise so people from the same area will sail together.  \n\nAlso sugar hotels.  If I am going to be quarantined I would prefer it to be in a hotel full of SBs.",

I would worry that too many Sbs would want to come in this arrangement, just for the free cruise (models had to work 10 hours during the cruise, that arrangement doesn't work for SBs though)",
