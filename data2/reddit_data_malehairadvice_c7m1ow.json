            "body": "Yes, it's entirely possible. Looks like somewhere around a 5 up top, faded down to maybe a 2 on the sides, faded through the sideburns to like maybe a 1 for the beard. Anyone handy with clippers can do that... however you need pretty thick hair to achieve this look precisely. \n\nI'm sure you've seen plenty of scalp as this ridiculously short on the sides craze has swept the nation, because some people have fine hair. There's nothing wrong with that look, but if you want to keep the denser look of the hair and not have a lot of the pale scalp showing through, you need to account for your hair's thickness. Do you have larger diameter hair or smaller? Fine hair will need to be cut a little longer. \n\nFor styling, that's easy. After you've used a very small amount of shampoo followed by a little conditioner (bonus points for densifying conditioner), you towel-dry the hair, get a dime-sized amount of wax, warm it by rubbing between the palms, rub it to your fingers, and start from the back. You'll want to use sweeping forward and inward motions as you move forward. Once you get to the front, you may want to help it stand up a bit. Oil your beard, apply your daily moisturizer/spf and eye cream, and you're ready for the day.",
