If it were just Sai he'd have been fine. Sakura lying to him was a bigger impact than what Sai said.\n\nAlso the fact that he didn't know where Sakura was to stop her contributed for sure.",

I guarantee you Sasuke would find a way to do the same unless he already can.\n\nThe fact that he detected Sakura was behind him trying to stab him is proof he wasn't helpless after using Susanoo against Kakashi.\n\nAgainst Kakashi he'd lose but those others don't have Kamui to even stand up to the little time he had left with Susanoo.\n\nSasuke brought out Susanoo against Kakashi to show that his sharingan were superior to his though.",

Of course, sometimes the persistence pays off, but the larger liklihood that it won't and that you'll just annoy/harass the other person continously is why it's seen as 'bad'.",

Of course, sometimes the persistence pays off, but the larger liklihood that it won't and that you'll just annoy/harass the other person continously is why it's seen as 'bad'.",

Of course, sometimes the persistence pays off, but the larger liklihood that it won't and that you'll just annoy/harass the other person continously is why it's seen as 'bad'.",
