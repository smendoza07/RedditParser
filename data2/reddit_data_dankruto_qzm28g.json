The artist probably wouldn't even be safe if he made that canon. \n\nAlso, we definetly needed a sequel, so every ninja we knew had to be paired, to make as many kids as there could be, no matter how Little chemistry there was. What self respecting ninja would turn 30 without having at least one kid? Don't want to give yourself enough time to think is that even a good idea \n\nDamn. I really went on a rant back there",
