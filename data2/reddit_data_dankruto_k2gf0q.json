The Sharingan was literally what kiilled any chance of Naruto having a good, long-lasting plot; because anytime characters like Sasuke or any other Sharingan user got a new upgrade to their broke-ass pinkeye, characters like Naruto had to be given more SSJ Kyuubi forms to compensate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of, I dunno, being creative.\n\nAlso, Kurenai is a female character in a shonen written by a well known sexist. She has a great backstory and the (ironically) most level-headed and well-rounded personality out of all the jounin. She was just never used despite her skill set being uber unique.

Sasuke and Naruto have a battle outside but she and Obito did what in that timeframe? There were some good couple minutes that passed, since during the battle they also stand around to talk a few times. It would be logical for Obito to bring up the request to stab the Rinnegan right away, so either Obito conviniently forgets about the eye in his socket right until 2 seconds before Madara shows up, or he does tell Sakura to stab it from the start, but she hesitates for the entirety of that period of time.\n\nAnd people find it more probable that Obito isn't that dumb, so they blame Sakura.",

Kakashi was an all-rounder, jack of all trades capable of diversion, genjutsu, decent defensive techniques, many elemental jutsu, ninja tools use, even swordfighting, decorated with great strategy game and dynamic enemy analysis. All that was before he became a copy ninja and even before being capable of extremely high damage+speed attacks like the obvious sharingan-assisted chidori or kamui, which places him at kage levels anyway. Kakashi was capable of holding his own without the latter ones. That's something I would expect from someone we call \"the highest rank regular ninja\", which is a j\u014dnin. \n\nRest of Shippuuden's j\u014dnins were more like 'special j\u014dnins', not regular ones. They only knew how to hold their guard and excelled in one, maybe two things, something I'd expect from a chuunin. It's like it took three people to replace Kakashi. Take Guy. He was one of the strongest shinobi in the history, but he was like Naruto at the end of Shippuuden - ultra strong, but specialised in one or two things, tops. (in case of Naruto I exclude his plot-armor and plot-based boosts. Naruto excelled in short range combat and battlefield diversion, occasionally using a ninja tool. Mainly for even more diversion). \n\nJ\u014dnins were potential candidates for a kage and somehow J\u014dnin rank was achieved by ninja incapable of doing most of ninja stuff, like the raw power or cool, shiny jutsu was enough.\n\nObviously this is caused by plot and screen time, but I still wish there were more badass, versatile shinobi like Kakashi.",

You severely downplay the speed of 7tha gate guy, let alone 8th gate. 7th gate guy easily one shot a powered up Kisame who just sucked a whole ass jinchuuriki dry (albeit not having Samehada, but Samehada does not increase reaction speed or durability within seconds) Guy was able to keep up with the likes of KCM1 Naruto and Rinnegan Obito in 6/7 gate.

Not to mention Itachi has some of the best Genjutsu in the verse at his disposal; Guy trained enough to counter Kakashi\u2019s Sharingan, but Itachi\u2019s was leagues ahead of Kakashi\u2019s. The Gates wouldn\u2019t protect him from Itachi\u2019s eyes. \n\nOn your point about Obito: Obito may be able to avoid attacks with Kamui, but how is he going to get pass Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o? He going to Kamui through it? Then what? He has to make himself vulnerable to attack to do anything. Obito without Rinnegan stalemates Itachi. I\u2019ll concede that; Maybe he kills Itachi but not without sustaining significant injury himself. Imo the only reason he\u2019d survive is because of Zetsu\u2019s cells.",

He beats Itachi and Pain high diff imo\n\nFor the Itachi one, Itachi's genjutsu are visual genjutsu. He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

Sasuke and Naruto have a battle outside but she and Obito did what in that timeframe? There were some good couple minutes that passed, since during the battle they also stand around to talk a few times. It would be logical for Obito to bring up the request to stab the Rinnegan right away, so either Obito conviniently forgets about the eye in his socket right until 2 seconds before Madara shows up, or he does tell Sakura to stab it from the start, but she hesitates for the entirety of that period of time.\n\nAnd people find it more probable that Obito isn't that dumb, so they blame Sakura.",

Kakashi was an all-rounder, jack of all trades capable of diversion, genjutsu, decent defensive techniques, many elemental jutsu, ninja tools use, even swordfighting, decorated with great strategy game and dynamic enemy analysis. All that was before he became a copy ninja and even before being capable of extremely high damage+speed attacks like the obvious sharingan-assisted chidori or kamui, which places him at kage levels anyway. Kakashi was capable of holding his own without the latter ones. That's something I would expect from someone we call \"the highest rank regular ninja\", which is a j\u014dnin. \n\nRest of Shippuuden's j\u014dnins were more like 'special j\u014dnins', not regular ones. They only knew how to hold their guard and excelled in one, maybe two things, something I'd expect from a chuunin. It's like it took three people to replace Kakashi. Take Guy. He was one of the strongest shinobi in the history, but he was like Naruto at the end of Shippuuden - ultra strong, but specialised in one or two things, tops. (in case of Naruto I exclude his plot-armor and plot-based boosts. Naruto excelled in short range combat and battlefield diversion, occasionally using a ninja tool. Mainly for even more diversion). \n\nJ\u014dnins were potential candidates for a kage and somehow J\u014dnin rank was achieved by ninja incapable of doing most of ninja stuff, like the raw power or cool, shiny jutsu was enough.\n\nObviously this is caused by plot and screen time, but I still wish there were more badass, versatile shinobi like Kakashi.",

He beats Itachi and Pain high diff imo\n\nFor the Itachi one, Itachi's genjutsu are visual genjutsu. He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

Let me use your logic to show you where you messed up. You forgot to show the degree to which 7th gate guy outcasses 6th gate guy. You even mentioned that Guy scales well beyond Kisame, so why end there as if he is equal to Itachi? He is far from Itachi. That's like me stating War Arc Kakashi is well beyond a chuunin, but Hidan is above chuunin no matter what, so Hidan is equal to Kakashi.",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

Sasuke and Naruto have a battle outside but she and Obito did what in that timeframe? There were some good couple minutes that passed, since during the battle they also stand around to talk a few times. It would be logical for Obito to bring up the request to stab the Rinnegan right away, so either Obito conviniently forgets about the eye in his socket right until 2 seconds before Madara shows up, or he does tell Sakura to stab it from the start, but she hesitates for the entirety of that period of time.\n\nAnd people find it more probable that Obito isn't that dumb, so they blame Sakura.",

He beats Itachi and Pain high diff imo\n\nFor the Itachi one, Itachi's genjutsu are visual genjutsu. He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

He has to see what he\u2019s trying to hit; Not to mention Itachi\u2019s proficiency with clone jutsu would probably leave an opening to exploit. \n\nI don\u2019t think Kisame was fighting to kill Guy or anyone else; He wanted to escape. Guy wasn\u2019t even being attacked when he activated the 7th gate iirc: He was just stopping Kisame from escaping with intel. I don\u2019t think Guy was losing that fight at any point really. \n\nGuy could try and blitz Itachi or Kisame, but I feel Kisame survives the blitz and Itachi evades via clones or Susano\u2019o. Itachi even said they had to leave because they didn\u2019t want a war; Not because Guy was too much for them. \n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that Itachi succumbed to his illness rather than Sasuke\u2019s Kirin. Sasuke was weaker than Itachi up until the Five Kage Summit arc imo.",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

The Sharingan was literally what kiilled any chance of Naruto having a good, long-lasting plot; because anytime characters like Sasuke or any other Sharingan user got a new upgrade to their broke-ass pinkeye, characters like Naruto had to be given more SSJ Kyuubi forms to compensate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of, I dunno, being creative.\n\nAlso, Kurenai is a female character in a shonen written by a well known sexist. She has a great backstory and the (ironically) most level-headed and well-rounded personality out of all the jounin. She was just never used despite her skill set being uber unique.

Sasuke and Naruto have a battle outside but she and Obito did what in that timeframe? There were some good couple minutes that passed, since during the battle they also stand around to talk a few times. It would be logical for Obito to bring up the request to stab the Rinnegan right away, so either Obito conviniently forgets about the eye in his socket right until 2 seconds before Madara shows up, or he does tell Sakura to stab it from the start, but she hesitates for the entirety of that period of time.\n\nAnd people find it more probable that Obito isn't that dumb, so they blame Sakura.",

He going to Kamui through it? Then what? He has to make himself vulnerable to attack to do anything. Obito without Rinnegan stalemates Itachi.

He beats Itachi and Pain high diff imo\n\nFor the Itachi one, Itachi's genjutsu are visual genjutsu. He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

Guy wasn\u2019t even being attacked when he activated the 7th gate iirc: He was just stopping Kisame from escaping with intel. I don\u2019t think Guy was losing that fight at any point really. \n\nGuy could try and blitz Itachi or Kisame, but I feel Kisame survives the blitz and Itachi evades via clones or Susano\u2019o. Itachi even said they had to leave because they didn\u2019t want a war; Not because Guy was too much for them. \n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that Itachi succumbed to his illness rather than Sasuke\u2019s Kirin.

Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

It would be logical for Obito to bring up the request to stab the Rinnegan right away, so either Obito conviniently forgets about the eye in his socket right until 2 seconds before Madara shows up, or he does tell Sakura to stab it from the start, but she hesitates for the entirety of that period of time.\n\nAnd people find it more probable that Obito isn't that dumb, so they blame Sakura.",

The Gates wouldn\u2019t protect him from Itachi\u2019s eyes. \n\nOn your point about Obito: Obito may be able to avoid attacks with Kamui, but how is he going to get pass Itachi\u2019s Susano\u2019o? He going to Kamui through it? Then what? He has to make himself vulnerable to attack to do anything. Obito without Rinnegan stalemates Itachi. I\u2019ll concede that; Maybe he kills Itachi but not without sustaining significant injury himself. Imo the only reason he\u2019d survive is because of Zetsu\u2019s cells.",

He beats Itachi and Pain high diff imo\n\nFor the Itachi one, Itachi's genjutsu are visual genjutsu. He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

Guy wasn\u2019t even being attacked when he activated the 7th gate iirc: He was just stopping Kisame from escaping with intel. I don\u2019t think Guy was losing that fight at any point really. \n\nGuy could try and blitz Itachi or Kisame, but I feel Kisame survives the blitz and Itachi evades via clones or Susano\u2019o. Itachi even said they had to leave because they didn\u2019t want a war; Not because Guy was too much for them. \n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that Itachi succumbed to his illness rather than Sasuke\u2019s Kirin.

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

He has to see what he\u2019s trying to hit; Not to mention Itachi\u2019s proficiency with clone jutsu would probably leave an opening to exploit. \n\nI don\u2019t think Kisame was fighting to kill Guy or anyone else; He wanted to escape. Guy wasn\u2019t even being attacked when he activated the 7th gate iirc: He was just stopping Kisame from escaping with intel. I don\u2019t think Guy was losing that fight at any point really. \n\nGuy could try and blitz Itachi or Kisame, but I feel Kisame survives the blitz and Itachi evades via clones or Susano\u2019o. Itachi even said they had to leave because they didn\u2019t want a war; Not because Guy was too much for them. \n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that Itachi succumbed to his illness rather than Sasuke\u2019s Kirin. Sasuke was weaker than Itachi up until the Five Kage Summit arc imo.",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

I believe the battle would come down to visual prowess, not physical strength/speed; And  Itachi\u2019s Dojutsu has been shown to be superior to pre-Rinnegan Obito\u2019s. Obito has Kamui and then what? Basic Sharingan buffs and a single Izanagi. Itachi has 3 Mangyeko Sharingan powers at his disposal. Albeit ones that are limited by his physical condition. \n\nUnless Obito can Izanagi away Tsukuyomi, Kotoamatsukami, and the Totsuka Blade, which he can\u2019t: He doesn\u2019t kill Itachi.

His base sharingan genjutsu made the mizukage, a perfect jinchuriki, his puppet. \n\nAlso, i can literally quote itachi saying that someone with a mangekyo can defend against tsukyomi. \n\nAlso the kotoamatsukami was pre programmed to only work on itachis eyes and on a specific command, I don't think he can change it willy nilly.\n\nTobirama implied that the stronger an uchihas hate, the stronger his sharingan (not all sharingans are created equally), and imo itachi doesn't exactly beat him in that.\n\nKamui is far too haxed, easily surpasses all mangekyo abilities except for kotoamatsukami (a normal one, cuz you can make anyone do anything, and you don't even need eye contact)\n\n>Unless Obito can Izanagi away Tsukuyomi, Kotoamatsukami, and the Totsuka Blade,\n\nWasn't it implied that danzo used izanagi against shisuis kotoamatsukami. Well in any case, izanagi would definitely work against totsuka blade (well during the sealing part, itachi won't even be able to touch him with totsuka blade anyway so it doesn't matter).\n\nJust to point out, obito knows everything about itachi, but not the reverse.",

He going to Kamui through it? Then what? He has to make himself vulnerable to attack to do anything. Obito without Rinnegan stalemates Itachi.

He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi?

I don\u2019t think Guy was losing that fight at any point really. \n\nGuy could try and blitz Itachi or Kisame, but I feel Kisame survives the blitz and Itachi evades via clones or Susano\u2019o. Itachi even said they had to leave because they didn\u2019t want a war; Not because Guy was too much for them. \n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that Itachi succumbed to his illness rather than Sasuke\u2019s Kirin.

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

He uses his Sharingan. That means Guy's plan works flawlessly on most Uchiha, because visual genjutsu requires eye contact, just like Tayuya's and the Sage Tiara's auditory genjutsu work when you hear the sound they produce, so Guy avoids genjutsu no matter how much stronger it is than Kakashi. The gates were never said to help or increase genjutsu immunity. Guy just came up with the plan not to look itachi in the eyes. To prove this works, Naruto made sure to tell Bee not to look into Itachi's eyes, because the genjutsu needs eye contact to work.\n\nOn the Susanoo part, 1 hirudora and it's GG. You act like guy takes as much time as Lee r open the gate, when, while losing to a powered up Kisame in 6th gate, he managed to open the 7th gate in the head of battle. If Itachi's Susanoo could not handle a Kirin from Taka Sasuke with the Tata mirror, what's stopping an even more powerful Taijutsu from completely wrecking Itachi's Susanoo and Itachi? As I said, if Itachi let's Guy open party the 5th gate, he loses instantly",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",

He can be proficient with clone jutsu all he wants, Guy is avoiding eye contact, especially since he can blitz Itachi.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Kisame was attempting to do, he was powered up and lost to 7th gate Guy with a one shot. Guy was definitely losing in the 6th gate. 6th gate guy was struggling vs a 30% clone of Kisame. He needed the extra boost, but it was way overboard seeing as Kisame got one shot. \n\nGuy could just nuke both of them with a hirudora and Itachi would definitely die while Kisame would barely survive, and this is assuming the extra chakra from bee that powered him up was not what enabled him to survive. \n\nIt also does not matter that Sasuke was weaker than Itachi at that point. Upon realizing a huge jutsu was on its way, Itachi felt the need to pull out his Susanoo, and he barely survived. That Kirin has nothing on a hirudora, as it only destroyed the Uchiha hideout, while the hirudora caused earthquakes that could be felt a long distance away. Again, all of this is assuming Itachi is even able to react to Guy in the 7th gate. \n\nJust because Itachi did not state Guy could beat them, doesn't mean he couldn't. We have not been given at reason to believe he was aware of Guy's power, so all that could be on the assumption that Guy at his strongest was right in front of him.",
