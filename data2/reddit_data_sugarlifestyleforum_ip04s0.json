    "body": "These youngins.  Now this SD of some means MIGHT contemplate hanging out with you as a platonic and give you MODEST help from time to time  if you were pretty, REALLY SMART, were passionately interested in the same things as I and i could justify it as a better use of my time that all the crappy happy hours i have to do to generate top line revenue.   But the idea i would pay you a couple hundred for a lunch if the most interesting thing you do is go to the beach and you havent even seen angela landsbury's monologue from manchurian.   please.",

Some of the really weird things she asked are if her parents could tell she had sex or not and if the money i gave her was the same as her parents got from their jobs (granted Europe used to have different currencies 20 years ago, but now euros are euros).  \nWhole thing was surreal, girl graduates high school in a large city and doesn't know how sex or money works.  \nOh, and she asked if she was supposed to tell people i was her boyfriend if we did go ahead with it...  \nAnyway, i decided not to go ahead with it because the girl might go meetoo-ey if the parents found out.

About 10 minutes later she brings up the subject of one of her girlfriends getting tied up by a SD while they were playing around (i later understood she took that literally and didn't link it to anything sexual). To which i answer something along the lines of 'relax i'm not into any weird fetishes, just your casual fucking'.\nAs i said, she actually cried, then figured out her friends did it with their SDs and asked me if that was normal and expected of her. I calmed her and explained how things worked. She said she was ok with it since she didn't have any choice, but as i said i passed.",

Mainly because culturally in asia we are quite i would say, judgy. So entire industries have been built up around that. \n\nSo here in the east especially the far east(think japan and korea) men are not allowed to complain about work or home life, leading to very stressful situations. The compromise is, that if you go to a hostess club(with friends or colleagues) or have a platonic sr via a dating club(could be non platonic also), that person is or persons are pretty much required to sit there and listen to you complain about it. While sharing drinks and egging you on.\n\nMay not be relevant to most of you but just throwing it out there, that it is not inconcivable that it happens and in some cases that might be what is happening.\n\nI would say just dont knock on it but the ladies out there should not think that outside of asia, it is a common thing. It isnt. But is it impossible or even improbable? Nope.",

I have only been once and it was a strange experience for me. Since they werent intimate but they werent really listening to what i say.

You pay the food, give her a little present if you're interested and proceed.\n\nThough the idea of giving someone full allowance to come out and eat your food is just being a doormat. Said person will exploit the situation as long as possible and keep dangling the reward as long as you are willing to m'lady her. \n\nSo some balance is required and a little bit of street smarts to understand who you are dealing with. You need both the desire to gamble a bit and be ok if you lose, and you also need to know when to walk away from the situation because it's just a money sink.\n\nCue Kenny Rogers.",

He is not willing to lose the platonic, but he is continuously hoping, that may be, just may be, one day, intimacy will happen.\nMy personal experience with this situation is with my wife. I want to have sex. She does not want to have it (with me at least). I still love her, enjoy her company, parent with her, support her disabled dad etc. But we have not had sex since 9/2009. Even before that it was only a few times/year. We are still married. But I need to find a SB for sex, because she will not.",

She was probably telling the truth, though i've seen some good acting in my time...    \nWhat was really striking was that she seemed to have no real life experience (sexually or otherwise) which i found odd since she was very good looking and smart. Some of the really weird things she asked are if her parents could tell she had sex or not and if the money i gave her was the same as her parents got from their jobs (granted Europe used to have different currencies 20 years ago, but now euros are euros).  \nWhole thing was surreal, girl graduates high school in a large city and doesn't know how sex or money works.  \nOh, and she asked if she was supposed to tell people i was her boyfriend if we did go ahead with it...  \nAnyway, i decided not to go ahead with it because the girl might go meetoo-ey if the parents found out.

She seemed to get the message. About 10 minutes later she brings up the subject of one of her girlfriends getting tied up by a SD while they were playing around (i later understood she took that literally and didn't link it to anything sexual). To which i answer something along the lines of 'relax i'm not into any weird fetishes, just your casual fucking'.\nAs i said, she actually cried, then figured out her friends did it with their SDs and asked me if that was normal and expected of her. I calmed her and explained how things worked. She said she was ok with it since she didn't have any choice, but as i said i passed.",

You pay the food, give her a little present if you're interested and proceed.\n\nThough the idea of giving someone full allowance to come out and eat your food is just being a doormat. Said person will exploit the situation as long as possible and keep dangling the reward as long as you are willing to m'lady her. \n\nSo some balance is required and a little bit of street smarts to understand who you are dealing with. You need both the desire to gamble a bit and be ok if you lose, and you also need to know when to walk away from the situation because it's just a money sink.\n\nCue Kenny Rogers.",

He stopped at the club out of blue, he doesn\u2019t like being there because he knows the girls aren\u2019t really happy. So I\u2019m not sure if he gets aroused? I don\u2019t think I have to ask him haha I\u2019m sure he would like to but if he really needed it or was set on that then I\u2019m sure he\u2019d ask himself. Since he has not, I won\u2019t ask because I\u2019m very happy without having that in our life and he seems so too. What\u2019s touching going to improve? If everything already feels and it\u2019s been feeling so good, why ruin it?\n\nI don\u2019t think he has poor self esteem or a bad way he views himself. I truly just think he thinks of me as a goddess because life is so beautiful with me without sex. \nI also personally would hate to force sex into it by either parties because then I\u2019ll be truly repulsed to even be around you.",

My interpretation is that sex would ruin it for you, but it could enhance it for him? One could possibly interpret that to be that you are taking advantage of his loneliness. You enjoy his platonic company and benefits. He wants more, but you are not willing to provide it. He is not willing to lose the platonic, but he is continuously hoping, that may be, just may be, one day, intimacy will happen.\nMy personal experience with this situation is with my wife. I want to have sex. She does not want to have it (with me at least). I still love her, enjoy her company, parent with her, support her disabled dad etc. But we have not had sex since 9/2009. Even before that it was only a few times/year. We are still married. But I need to find a SB for sex, because she will not.",

She was probably telling the truth, though i've seen some good acting in my time...    \nWhat was really striking was that she seemed to have no real life experience (sexually or otherwise) which i found odd since she was very good looking and smart. Some of the really weird things she asked are if her parents could tell she had sex or not and if the money i gave her was the same as her parents got from their jobs (granted Europe used to have different currencies 20 years ago, but now euros are euros).  \nWhole thing was surreal, girl graduates high school in a large city and doesn't know how sex or money works.  \nOh, and she asked if she was supposed to tell people i was her boyfriend if we did go ahead with it...  \nAnyway, i decided not to go ahead with it because the girl might go meetoo-ey if the parents found out. Plenty of fish in the bowl.",

She seemed to get the message. About 10 minutes later she brings up the subject of one of her girlfriends getting tied up by a SD while they were playing around (i later understood she took that literally and didn't link it to anything sexual). To which i answer something along the lines of 'relax i'm not into any weird fetishes, just your casual fucking'.\nAs i said, she actually cried, then figured out her friends did it with their SDs and asked me if that was normal and expected of her. I calmed her and explained how things worked. She said she was ok with it since she didn't have any choice, but as i said i passed.",

I have only been once and it was a strange experience for me. Since they werent intimate but they werent really listening to what i say.

You pay the food, give her a little present if you're interested and proceed.\n\nThough the idea of giving someone full allowance to come out and eat your food is just being a doormat. Said person will exploit the situation as long as possible and keep dangling the reward as long as you are willing to m'lady her. \n\nSo some balance is required and a little bit of street smarts to understand who you are dealing with. You need both the desire to gamble a bit and be ok if you lose, and you also need to know when to walk away from the situation because it's just a money sink.\n\nCue Kenny Rogers.",

If everything already feels and it\u2019s been feeling so good, why ruin it?\n\nI don\u2019t think he has poor self esteem or a bad way he views himself. I truly just think he thinks of me as a goddess because life is so beautiful with me without sex. \nI also personally would hate to force sex into it by either parties because then I\u2019ll be truly repulsed to even be around you.",

My interpretation is that sex would ruin it for you, but it could enhance it for him? One could possibly interpret that to be that you are taking advantage of his loneliness. You enjoy his platonic company and benefits. He wants more, but you are not willing to provide it. He is not willing to lose the platonic, but he is continuously hoping, that may be, just may be, one day, intimacy will happen.\nMy personal experience with this situation is with my wife. I want to have sex. She does not want to have it (with me at least). I still love her, enjoy her company, parent with her, support her disabled dad etc. But we have not had sex since 9/2009. Even before that it was only a few times/year. We are still married. But I need to find a SB for sex, because she will not.",

He is not willing to lose the platonic, but he is continuously hoping, that may be, just may be, one day, intimacy will happen.\nMy personal experience with this situation is with my wife. I want to have sex. She does not want to have it (with me at least). I still love her, enjoy her company, parent with her, support her disabled dad etc. But we have not had sex since 9/2009. Even before that it was only a few times/year. We are still married. But I need to find a SB for sex, because she will not.",

It is pleasant to share differences in opinions on Reddit, without someone getting rude or insulting.\n\nThe last sentence of your initial response to me was \"They don't care about sex.\" It seems to me that you do not know that. In fact it seems to me that believe that he does care about sex but neither of you has brought it up. You do not want it, unless he pays more, so you are not going to spoil a situation where you are content. \n\nBut, he probably cares about sex.",

Since he has not, I won\u2019t ask because I\u2019m very happy without having that in our life and he seems so too. What\u2019s touching going to improve? If everything already feels and it\u2019s been feeling so good, why ruin it?\n\nI don\u2019t think he has poor self esteem or a bad way he views himself.

One could possibly interpret that to be that you are taking advantage of his loneliness. You enjoy his platonic company and benefits. He wants more, but you are not willing to provide it. He is not willing to lose the platonic, but he is continuously hoping, that may be, just may be, one day, intimacy will happen.\nMy personal experience with this situation is with my wife. I want to have sex. She does not want to have it (with me at least). I still love her, enjoy her company, parent with her, support her disabled dad etc. But we have not had sex since 9/2009. Even before that it was only a few times/year. We are still married. But I need to find a SB for sex, because she will not.",

One could possibly interpret that to be that you are taking advantage of his loneliness. You enjoy his platonic company and benefits. He wants more, but you are not willing to provide it. He is not willing to lose the platonic, but he is continuously hoping, that may be, just may be, one day, intimacy will happen.\nMy personal experience with this situation is with my wife. I want to have sex. She does not want to have it (with me at least). I still love her, enjoy her company, parent with her, support her disabled dad etc. But we have not had sex since 9/2009. Even before that it was only a few times/year. We are still married. But I need to find a SB for sex, because she will not.",
