In the rare case you do get side effects, just discontinue taking it and your body will go back to normal (the ED thing is because like 2% of men it lowered free testosterone; as DHT conversion is blocked in some cases it could signal to the body to produce less test since it's not being converted. If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair. It's best used topically, especially if you micro needle it. It's actually pretty cool, if you search around Reddit you can see a bunch of people unable to grow beards that are using it successfully for that.",

This is simply not true at all , your testosterone does not decline when you\u2019re on the drug, less testosterone is being converted into DHT therefore you actually have a slightly higher free testosterone reading than your normal baseline. Your testosterone does not lower, the reason why some people get erectile dysfunction and other side effects on the drug is because these people already have low testosterone and when they use something like finasteride or dutasteride to block the enzyme their low testosterone can\u2019t pick up the slack. More Plates More Dates on YouTube explains it very thoroughly, so many people and even doctors have told me that it lowers testosterone levels and I can\u2019t get a damn prescription for it. The fact is it DOES NOT lower testosterone, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT. If you get bloodwork before taking the drug and after waiting for the drug to take full effect, I guarantee you that your free testosterone levels will read higher than your base before using finasteride.",

I blowdry back off of my face initially then roughly into whatever style I am going for.  Sometimes thats all I do.  If I want to do more, I have been using Morrocanoil Hyrdating cream or Hanz De Fuko Scheme Cream or sometimes Quicksand.  I have been staying away from heavier hold stuff as its gotten longer.  I also sometimes throw on a light mist of hair spray but hate to use too much of it.  Often I just tie it as well and if I know I will just be doing that I usually skip the extras.  Also dry shampoo is your friend if it needs sprucing up.",

In the rare case you do get side effects, just discontinue taking it and your body will go back to normal (the ED thing is because like 2% of men it lowered free testosterone; as DHT conversion is blocked in some cases it could signal to the body to produce less test since it's not being converted. If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair. It's best used topically, especially if you micro needle it.

This is simply not true at all , your testosterone does not decline when you\u2019re on the drug, less testosterone is being converted into DHT therefore you actually have a slightly higher free testosterone reading than your normal baseline. Your testosterone does not lower, the reason why some people get erectile dysfunction and other side effects on the drug is because these people already have low testosterone and when they use something like finasteride or dutasteride to block the enzyme their low testosterone can\u2019t pick up the slack. More Plates More Dates on YouTube explains it very thoroughly, so many people and even doctors have told me that it lowers testosterone levels and I can\u2019t get a damn prescription for it. The fact is it DOES NOT lower testosterone, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT. If you get bloodwork before taking the drug and after waiting for the drug to take full effect, I guarantee you that your free testosterone levels will read higher than your base before using finasteride.",

In the rare case you do get side effects, just discontinue taking it and your body will go back to normal (the ED thing is because like 2% of men it lowered free testosterone; as DHT conversion is blocked in some cases it could signal to the body to produce less test since it's not being converted. If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair. It's best used topically, especially if you micro needle it. It's actually pretty cool, if you search around Reddit you can see a bunch of people unable to grow beards that are using it successfully for that.",

This is simply not true at all , your testosterone does not decline when you\u2019re on the drug, less testosterone is being converted into DHT therefore you actually have a slightly higher free testosterone reading than your normal baseline. Your testosterone does not lower, the reason why some people get erectile dysfunction and other side effects on the drug is because these people already have low testosterone and when they use something like finasteride or dutasteride to block the enzyme their low testosterone can\u2019t pick up the slack. More Plates More Dates on YouTube explains it very thoroughly, so many people and even doctors have told me that it lowers testosterone levels and I can\u2019t get a damn prescription for it. The fact is it DOES NOT lower testosterone, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT. If you get bloodwork before taking the drug and after waiting for the drug to take full effect, I guarantee you that your free testosterone levels will read higher than your base before using finasteride.",

If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair.

This is simply not true at all , your testosterone does not decline when you\u2019re on the drug, less testosterone is being converted into DHT therefore you actually have a slightly higher free testosterone reading than your normal baseline. Your testosterone does not lower, the reason why some people get erectile dysfunction and other side effects on the drug is because these people already have low testosterone and when they use something like finasteride or dutasteride to block the enzyme their low testosterone can\u2019t pick up the slack. More Plates More Dates on YouTube explains it very thoroughly, so many people and even doctors have told me that it lowers testosterone levels and I can\u2019t get a damn prescription for it. The fact is it DOES NOT lower testosterone, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT. If you get bloodwork before taking the drug and after waiting for the drug to take full effect, I guarantee you that your free testosterone levels will read higher than your base before using finasteride.",

In the rare case you do get side effects, just discontinue taking it and your body will go back to normal (the ED thing is because like 2% of men it lowered free testosterone; as DHT conversion is blocked in some cases it could signal to the body to produce less test since it's not being converted. If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair. It's best used topically, especially if you micro needle it. It's actually pretty cool, if you search around Reddit you can see a bunch of people unable to grow beards that are using it successfully for that.",

This is simply not true at all , your testosterone does not decline when you\u2019re on the drug, less testosterone is being converted into DHT therefore you actually have a slightly higher free testosterone reading than your normal baseline. Your testosterone does not lower, the reason why some people get erectile dysfunction and other side effects on the drug is because these people already have low testosterone and when they use something like finasteride or dutasteride to block the enzyme their low testosterone can\u2019t pick up the slack. More Plates More Dates on YouTube explains it very thoroughly, so many people and even doctors have told me that it lowers testosterone levels and I can\u2019t get a damn prescription for it. The fact is it DOES NOT lower testosterone, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT. If you get bloodwork before taking the drug and after waiting for the drug to take full effect, I guarantee you that your free testosterone levels will read higher than your base before using finasteride.",

In the rare case you do get side effects, just discontinue taking it and your body will go back to normal (the ED thing is because like 2% of men it lowered free testosterone; as DHT conversion is blocked in some cases it could signal to the body to produce less test since it's not being converted. If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair. It's best used topically, especially if you micro needle it. It's actually pretty cool, if you search around Reddit you can see a bunch of people unable to grow beards that are using it successfully for that.",

This is simply not true at all , your testosterone does not decline when you\u2019re on the drug, less testosterone is being converted into DHT therefore you actually have a slightly higher free testosterone reading than your normal baseline. Your testosterone does not lower, the reason why some people get erectile dysfunction and other side effects on the drug is because these people already have low testosterone and when they use something like finasteride or dutasteride to block the enzyme their low testosterone can\u2019t pick up the slack. More Plates More Dates on YouTube explains it very thoroughly, so many people and even doctors have told me that it lowers testosterone levels and I can\u2019t get a damn prescription for it. The fact is it DOES NOT lower testosterone, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT. If you get bloodwork before taking the drug and after waiting for the drug to take full effect, I guarantee you that your free testosterone levels will read higher than your base before using finasteride.",

In the rare case you do get side effects, just discontinue taking it and your body will go back to normal (the ED thing is because like 2% of men it lowered free testosterone; as DHT conversion is blocked in some cases it could signal to the body to produce less test since it's not being converted. If you go on it just monitor your test levels via blood draws every few months until you know the medication is working) \n\nMinoxidil is used for recovering/growing hair. It's best used topically, especially if you micro needle it. It's actually pretty cool, if you search around Reddit you can see a bunch of people unable to grow beards that are using it successfully for that.",

It\u2019s a preventative medication so if you let it go way back there may be no hope to recover you just have to get on top of it if you see yourself going down that road",
