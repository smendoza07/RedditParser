(More specifically: identify what YOUR curl pattern is, and the basics of curl care for your pattern type- it's not 100% the same routine for ALL curls!)\n\n\nIf I was only allowed one word to say, it'd be MOISTURE. Curls need to be well hydrated in order to get definition and prevent frizziness/breakage. Get rid of all the products that are drying your hair out, and replace with new products specifically formulated by curly-haired people, for curly-haired people. That's at least 50% of the battle, if not more. R/curlyhair can guide you on this.\n\n\nOh, and you should only brush/comb out your curls in the shower, when its sopping wet and/or swimming in conditioner! Otherwise, hands off those curls!",

For these 2 reasons:\n\n1) a lot of people have *no idea* what their hair is *naturally* inclined to do, because they've been using products geared towards encouraging STRAIGHT hair their whole lives. (There is a conversation to be had here about institutional racism a la Euro-centric beauty standards in the haircare/personal care products industry buuut that's a BIG conversation....) Anyway, I was this person. I thought I had straight hair that just \"didn't ever behave.\" Turns out I just had no clue my hair WAS actually inclined to wave/curl. Once I started taking care of it properly my curls basically LEAPT out of my head. I think anybody w/ \"problematic hair\" may want to give the curly method at least  a 2-3 week trial, just to see what happens!\n\n2) the \"unnatural\" processes that produce curls/waves/coils (perms, etc) still should be cared for very gently and carefully, and the overwhelming majority of the regular products you find in the haircare aisle just... are not adequate. \"Unnatural\" curls would still absolutely benefit from being cared for in similar ways as natural curls, and r/curlyhair can still help with that part! :-)",

The last time I bought hair stuff I got a cowash, leave in conditioner, and a curl jelly-- all for about $20! That'll last me about a month.

I hope r/curlyhair will be as helpful to you as it has been to me.\nAlso, I recommend looking into starting CGM, Curly Girl/Guy Method, which helps take you on a natural journey for better hair care.\nOh, and if it helps, this length and style look good on you!",

You might have low porosity if your hair doesn't wet quickly. And you seem to have medium thickness and density. But double-check yourself or with a hair professional.",

I squeeze out some water then add Cantu curl defining cream. You can get this at target or CVS it\u2019s really cheap. Scrunch it into your hair and it should be very wet. I let it air dry and it keeps it really hydrated. If you want to diffuse you can. Typically I\u2019ve found air drying works best although it can take hours to completely dry. Great hair!",

For these 2 reasons:\n\n1) a lot of people have *no idea* what their hair is *naturally* inclined to do, because they've been using products geared towards encouraging STRAIGHT hair their whole lives. (There is a conversation to be had here about institutional racism a la Euro-centric beauty standards in the haircare/personal care products industry buuut that's a BIG conversation....) Anyway, I was this person. I thought I had straight hair that just \"didn't ever behave.\" Turns out I just had no clue my hair WAS actually inclined to wave/curl. Once I started taking care of it properly my curls basically LEAPT out of my head. I think anybody w/ \"problematic hair\" may want to give the curly method at least  a 2-3 week trial, just to see what happens!\n\n2) the \"unnatural\" processes that produce curls/waves/coils (perms, etc) still should be cared for very gently and carefully, and the overwhelming majority of the regular products you find in the haircare aisle just... are not adequate. \"Unnatural\" curls would still absolutely benefit from being cared for in similar ways as natural curls, and r/curlyhair can still help with that part! :-)",

You might have low porosity if your hair doesn't wet quickly. And you seem to have medium thickness and density. But double-check yourself or with a hair professional.",

For these 2 reasons:\n\n1) a lot of people have *no idea* what their hair is *naturally* inclined to do, because they've been using products geared towards encouraging STRAIGHT hair their whole lives. (There is a conversation to be had here about institutional racism a la Euro-centric beauty standards in the haircare/personal care products industry buuut that's a BIG conversation....) Anyway, I was this person. I thought I had straight hair that just \"didn't ever behave.\" Turns out I just had no clue my hair WAS actually inclined to wave/curl. Once I started taking care of it properly my curls basically LEAPT out of my head. I think anybody w/ \"problematic hair\" may want to give the curly method at least  a 2-3 week trial, just to see what happens!\n\n2) the \"unnatural\" processes that produce curls/waves/coils (perms, etc) still should be cared for very gently and carefully, and the overwhelming majority of the regular products you find in the haircare aisle just... are not adequate. \"Unnatural\" curls would still absolutely benefit from being cared for in similar ways as natural curls, and r/curlyhair can still help with that part! :-)",

The last time I bought hair stuff I got a cowash, leave in conditioner, and a curl jelly-- all for about $20! That'll last me about a month. And the quality is already soo much better than the \"normal\" hair stuff out there. It doesn't matter that I didn't buy the \"fancy brand\" of curlcare products. \n\nGood luck dude!",
