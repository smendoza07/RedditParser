Invest in as many mirrors as you can. \n\n3. Don't shave the top, instead, take an inch or so off, section by section. If it's too long after this, then consider shaving it at the longest guard. \n\n4. Find several youtube videos, watch them, and pay attention to the detail in what they say. A lot of YouTubers cut their hair differently, find what works. If their hair looks good then they know what they are saying.\n\n5. When edging your hair be VERY careful, ask a friend or parent to help you if you can. \n\nGood Luck my dude!",

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have enough thickness on both the mustache and the beard, so you'll have to shave it off. Try again in a year or two!\n\nAs for the hair, you have nice long hair, I wouldn't cut it so short like your before picture. The problem is it's going to be hard to have a stylish cut if you're cutting your hair without prior experience. Aim to have different styles at different lengths, and try them from longest to shortest. Give yourself at least an hour and remember the electric shavers metal will get hot after some use.\n\nI know this is mostly for hair, but I would also go try out different glasses, and shaving a couple pounds would do wonders for your cheeks. You can go to eyebuydirect website and pseudo try on glasses, and an easy way to lose the poundage is using CICO. Good hunting! Just remember you already look great, you're just looking for a way to look greater.",

Don't let it get above a minor stubble until/unless your cheeks fill out and connect, otherwise it ends up looking scraggly most times.\n\nSecond - haircut: I get doing it yourself, I really do, but at least pay a professional to get you back to a good starting point. Plenty of options here, but needs to be cleaned up especially on the sides. Something like a medium fade, 2 on the bottom up to a 4 on sides and back, and tell the barber to blend the top leaving a bit more up front to brush up (bonus if you show them the pic on the left)\n\nThird - glasses change if you can afford it. Others have mentioned Warby Parker, but you could even just walk into a Lenscrafters in the mall and take a bunch of selfies trying on frames. Have a friend critique or post it on an appropriate reddit sub\n\nFourth - clean up the unibrow a bit. I'm a hairy guy myself blessed with a natural unibrow, but I use the back side of a Gillette Mach 3 razor or equivalent (i.e. the side with just one blade) to clone one brow into two. Don't go crazy here, just clean up the hairs connecting the two eyebrows.",

I think some square frames would look great on you.\n\nHead hair wise I\u2019m not sure what to do cuz I myself have run into personal haircutting issues during covid. I was able to use a 5 guard around the sides and cut the hair on my sides in a way that looked good for what it was but I have thought of buzzing it all off lol\n\n(If you get the Warby Parker app, you can figure out what frames you like and they\u2019ll send some to your home to try on what you like!)",
