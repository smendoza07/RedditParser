I think with your overall face shape and weight class, something at a shorter length would work wonders. A crew cut with fringe not excessively tampered with, but still trimmed is what I had in mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also possible that the length isn't too much the problem as the hairstyle is. I don't know, but I've always found parting your hair down the middle as a guy rarely works and always leaves one draping side more elevated and possibly frizzy at the part.",

But for more volume on the weekends or for going out I love to use quicksand or quicksand and clay. It's by hanz de fuko and the stuff is actually magic. It gives thin hair a ton of volume and (imo) this great textured look. Clay doesn't really weigh down my hair so long as I use an appropriate amount (read: finger tip amount). Blow drying does give my hair extra volume and I will do it if I have time but often I'm too lazy to or run out of time in the morning. If I don't blow dry I'll just apply the clay directly into my dry or almost dry hair.",
