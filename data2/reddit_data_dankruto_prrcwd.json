All Naruto did was become Hokage. Stopping the Indra/Ashura cycle is completely different from finding an answer and being the chosen one to stop the cycle of hatred.",

Naruto promised them he had an answer to make things better, and it's just lazy to make him never answer that question, or Yada Yada it by saying \"oh he's Hokage so there's world peace.\" Literally, this post is about his broken promise to Nagato about saving the Rain village.

If it was that simple he would have just said he would be Hokage to Nagato or Obito as a counter, but that's not an ideology. Naruto promised them he had an answer to make things better, and it's just lazy to make him never answer that question, or Yada Yada it by saying \"oh he's Hokage so there's world peace.\" Literally, this post is about his broken promise to Nagato about saving the Rain village. He didn't do anything besides be Hokage and exist as someone strong. There's no answer.",

If it was that simple he would have just said he would be Hokage to Nagato or Obito as a counter, but that's not an ideology. Naruto promised them he had an answer to make things better, and it's just lazy to make him never answer that question, or Yada Yada it by saying \"oh he's Hokage so there's world peace.\" Literally, this post is about his broken promise to Nagato about saving the Rain village. He didn't do anything besides be Hokage and exist as someone strong. There's no answer.",

The Treaty of Versailles set tremendously harsh conditions for Germany, which caused their total economic collapse, which led to the rise of political radicalism by the late 1920s, which then led to the rise of the Nazi party in the 1930s. They didn\u2019t wake up one day and say \u201chey you know what, let\u2019s just kill a bunch of Jews\u201d, it was a long-boiling conflict with thousands of compounding factors. \n\nYes, by the time of WW2 they were absolutely the \u201cvillains\u201d, but it would\u2019ve been an entirely avoidable situation had the League of Nations not been such a monumental failure.",

If it was that simple he would have just said he would be Hokage to Nagato or Obito as a counter, but that's not an ideology. Naruto promised them he had an answer to make things better, and it's just lazy to make him never answer that question, or Yada Yada it by saying \"oh he's Hokage so there's world peace.\" Literally, this post is about his broken promise to Nagato about saving the Rain village. He didn't do anything besides be Hokage and exist as someone strong. There's no answer.",
