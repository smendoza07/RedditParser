But you can still learn something from his family and their accomplishments, as well as their faults. The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly. As weird as they might be they're a highly successful family. Not speaking monetarily, but both of the kids we see in the spotlight make music I've jammed with once or twice. There's no need for all the hate. Just send some hope and good energy their way if it bothers you that much. You're throwing a bunch of shots but I bet your entire family has plenty of skeletons in their closet's.

Just send some hope and good energy their way if it bothers you that much. You're throwing a bunch of shots but I bet your entire family has plenty of skeletons in their closet's.
