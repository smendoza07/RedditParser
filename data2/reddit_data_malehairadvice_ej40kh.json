But I feel pretty confident saying thats a good looking young man, he is putting effort into his appearance, and it shows.   This is very much one of those, \"if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all\" moments. \n\nAnd saying no offence doesnt really mean anything.  If you feel the need to put that disclaimer, its a super-secret sign that maybe you dont need to say it.\n\n\"woman lesbian\" ah shit man....  for any number of reasons that sounds so stupid, no offence.  (see? it doesnt work.)  But really man, cmon... I think I know what happened, you were going to say he looks like a woman, but you changed it in your head to lesbian, cause thats punchier or something, but you forgot to delete woman....   idk... or maybe you you just arent aware that while some women are lesbians, all lesbians are by default women?  Or maybe there are man lesbians? my apologies if Im unaware of someones situation.",

This is very much one of those, \"if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all\" moments. \n\nAnd saying no offence doesnt really mean anything.  If you feel the need to put that disclaimer, its a super-secret sign that maybe you dont need to say it.\n\n\"woman lesbian\" ah shit man....  for any number of reasons that sounds so stupid, no offence.  (see? it doesnt work.)  But really man, cmon... I think I know what happened, you were going to say he looks like a woman, but you changed it in your head to lesbian, cause thats punchier or something, but you forgot to delete woman....   idk... or maybe you you just arent aware that while some women are lesbians, all lesbians are by default women?  Or maybe there are man lesbians? my apologies if Im unaware of someones situation.",
