    "body": "been living in the house that i used to rent with my ex since he moved out a few months ago... but when he left, he left so much shit in the garage and house for me to deal with. \n\nmy amazing SD (the one who gave me a car if any of you remember me posting about that?) came over and helped me clean out the garage for three hours and put my exes shit on the street for the dump haul coming tomorrow. he even fixed my garbage disposal for me because it wasn\u2019t working right and i couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with it and didn\u2019t want to call my landlord about it. \n\ncouldn\u2019t be more thankful right now. really couldn\u2019t have moved all that shit out without his help and it\u2019s been horrid walking into the shit pile my ex left. he even swept up in the garage and helped clean up little things inside the house that may seem insignificant to some people... but when you\u2019ve been cleaning up someone else\u2019s stuff for about three months and you\u2019re still not done, it\u2019s seriously a fucking blessing. \n\ni was on the verge of just wanting to move because i was getting so fed up, and he helped improve my situation SO MUCH.\n\nwe even did measurements and are going to do little improvements in order to make my house feel like a home again.\n\nit\u2019s late, i\u2019m tired, i\u2019m happy. forgive my grammar.",

Reminds me of about 4 months ago, my SB needed brakes too. Showed her how to do it ourselves and we did it together. Yeah, it took about 4 hours, too lol! And a couple weeks later my other SB (her GF) needed to do hers too and so the one taught the other while I \"supervised\" :-)\n\nThat took a bit longer than the first four hours. But was still fun. \n\nI'm happy neither of them waited until a pad started gouging a rotor. If they had, I'd probably have needed to show them how to use a lathe to turn them :-\\ Because yeah - they actually wanna know that stuff and would have whined had I taken the rotors to the shop to be turned. \n\nSuch is the life when you have Engineers as SB's :-)",

And a couple weeks later my other SB (her GF) needed to do hers too and so the one taught the other while I \"supervised\" :-)\n\nThat took a bit longer than the first four hours. But was still fun. \n\nI'm happy neither of them waited until a pad started gouging a rotor. If they had, I'd probably have needed to show them how to use a lathe to turn them :-\\ Because yeah - they actually wanna know that stuff and would have whined had I taken the rotors to the shop to be turned. \n\nSuch is the life when you have Engineers as SB's :-)",

She makes good $ money in sales in an area that in prominently very wealthy...perfect grounds to find a SD.
