    "body": "So, I just got home from an amazing date with my new SD. This was our 3rd intimate date for reference. And I just had to post about how amazing he has been.\n\nMeet&Greet: Casual dinner at a restaurant. Conversation flows naturally. Next day, we talk sugar and he makes his offer of ppm plus shopping which I accept.\n\nFirst Date: Fun time at the zoo! We spent hours walking around. Highlights: got to see a massive snake devour a rabbit, someone dropped their phone right in front of us into the giraffe enclosure, and he insisted on getting me a cute little turtle ring in the gift shop (which I now wear almost everyday).\n\nSecond date: NYE, he picks me up and takes me to Best Buy because he wants to get me the laptop I mentioned I had wanted to help with my Korean studies. Go to dinner, then hotel and miss the fireworks but created plenty ourselves ;)\n\nThird date: tonight, we drove to a nearby city (less than an hour) and did a historical tour of a fort (he again insisted I get something from the gift shop so I got a mug). Walked around downtown, got lunch at an amazing place that he had been to before and had vegetarian options for me. Went to the hotel, had fun, cuddled. While cuddling he mentions he wants to take me grocery shopping since he had been thinking it must be hard for me to do without a car (so thoughtful!). So we head to target and he is putting tons of stuff he thinks i'll like into the cart. He also gets me a Keurig for my office since I just started drinking coffee. \n\nSo, there we have it. Brief summary of how caring my SD is and how compatible we are. We never have to think about what we want to do together next, because when we are out and talking we inevitably find something else we want to do together. I am going to start brainstorming what I can do for Valentine's Day to show him my appreciation.",

It's a mistake to judge the quality of the relationship based on just money or sex, its how you enjoy seeing each other and how you put the other person first.\n\nIf you are both catching feelings, have you discussed where you see this building up to? It may be something that is more than just s sugar relationship.",

As for catching feelings, I have not and as far as I know neither has he. We are both enjoying what we do for each other in the context of an arrangement. However, we are both single and neither of us are seeing anyone else (we did not have an exclusive talk, just so happens we are only seeing each other) so it kinda scares me that feelings could develop.",

I mean, that\u2019s pretty basic. \n\nAnd I personally think there\u2019s an unwritten rule that extras are naturally part of any arrangement. Of course, I don\u2019t do PPM, only monthly, so perhaps that makes a difference somehow. But it just seems to me that if you\u2019re in this type of relationship/arrangement with someone, the extras come out of a sense of caring and kindness\u2026 And if you\u2019re not offering caring and kindness to the person you\u2019re being intimate with, there really isn\u2019t much intimacy.",

Like during the negotiations, it would be a dealbreaker for me if a POT asked me about details around intimacy. Like, for how long do you want to fuck, will you give me oral, will you suck my balls, are you open to have a finger in your butt etc. Some things just have to be \"extras\" and I would say it's okay to expect them without asking for them beforehand.

I see absolutely no problems with that.\n\nIf a person has a bad experience, and \u201cbitches\u201d about it here, sharing that educates the community on, perhaps, red flags, or warning signs, and gives the OP chance for feedback on whatever their experience had been. \n\nAnd if a person isn\u2019t great at writing, perhaps their educational background wasn\u2019t top-notch. Perhaps they never thrived in English classes, or never had a teacher who helped them to learn the importance of topic sentences, paragraph structure, etc.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine being irritated by people being happy when their SR experiences are good, unhappy when their SR experiences are unpleasant, and not writing to your standards.
