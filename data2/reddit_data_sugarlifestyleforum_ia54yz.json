    "body": "Hi, I need an advice here \nI'm 30 M and I prefer to date in sugar life because tbh I won't be able to land beautiful girls in vanilla.\n\nSo I have been with this girl for 5 months, she asked me to buy her a gift for our 6 months anniversary, so I bought her a necklace and a galaxy S10 phone..\nWhen I gave her the phone she was upset I could tell.. \n\nI asked her what's wrong she said she was thinking I would giver her a better gift at least an iPhone or galaxy 20, a vacation etc\nThe thing is If she asked properly I would have given her anything she wanted but she asked me to surprise her and then she got upset and said she wanted to go home.\nI gave her the monthly allowance which was due on that day and she left and didn't contact for past 5 days. \nI kinda like her because she is so wild in bedroom but her personality set me off sometimes.\n\nEdit:  thanks for all the responses, I am sorry I can't reply to every comment. But you're all amazing and this forum is great. I have decided not to contact her and look for someone else. I don't mind that she disappeared after taking the allowance as it was due for that month. I reactivated my SA account and already had a few nice potential SB that I will try to set dates with.",

My phone may be older but I have everything on it and I'm very comfortable with it. A phone is very personal and becomes like an appendage. The phone he bought me was a different size and manufacturer. The way I handled it was I told him it was the beautiful gesture and very appreciated but that I was very happy with the phone I have and why. We went together to Best Buy to return the phone and exchanged it for a bunch of Nest smart home accessories. Things I didn't know I wanted or needed but I love the convenience and safety and my SD is happy that I'm secure and happy.\n\nI really think your SB should be more appreciative and flexible. Just because it wasn't exactly what she wanted it could easily be exchanged.",

Good SDs are harder to find than exceptional SBs, especially right now. I would attempt to talk with her and see how she handles it. If after 5 days her demeanor hasn't improved maybe it's time to re-evaluate.",

I think any relationship can be abusive, manipulative, etc. That seems to me what you are stuck in. You can do better than this. If you can afford to be this generous then you will find a gorgeous sugar baby who will really appreciate this kind of a gesture. Just look at how many awesome people there are in these threads, talking about how much they love their sugar daddy, how he surprised them with some small gift and it made them swoon. Sorry to be a negative person but what's going on here is not going to get better. You can't fix this. And really, the great thing about a sugar relationship is you can just break it off. You paid what you owed, your karma is clean. \n\nThat's my belief. I just really think you can do better and it's not OK to be in a relationship where you're being treated that way. It won't get better.\n\nSorry.",

I wouldn't be able to forgive or forget, I'd just be disgusted, so for me personally, I might have to peace out, as the kids say.\n\nThat said, in a zillion years I never would buy something this substantial for my SB of only 6 months -- especially a 20-year-old SB -- without a discussion.  If she asks me to surprise her, I can tell her \"I really want to get something you'll love and want to discuss together.  I've done surprises before and it worked out badly\".  IME, all you have to do is lightly push back, with a context of \"I want this to be perfect\", and 100% of women will accept it.  I'm not the best gift-buyer in the world, no fucking way I'm putting in this much time and effort, to risk disappointment.\n\nThe one alternative plan I sometimes take, if I have a general idea of what she wants, is to make the gift-buying itself an event.  If I know she'd like a purse, I'll take her out to a fancy dinner, we'll head to YSL (or whatever), I'll give her a budget and we'll go purse shopping together.  A 20-year-old will likely never have been in a YSL shopping for a purse that expensive, getting the posh treatment from the salesperson, feeling fancy, etc.  The entire thing will feel like an amazing luxury experience to her, and now you're part of that memory.  Don't be surprised if she IGs the fuck out of the whole thing.  Easy to do the same thing for the necklace, or even the phone (although the Verizon store is arguably less of a luxury experience lol).  The shopping trip to Dior or Chanel or wherever is itself part of the gift",

Yes there are girls who can handle it better but at 20, they\u2019re the exceptions not her.  \n\nAs for a galaxy S10...it\u2019s not the latest or greatest so I understand her disappointment.   Just cuz she said surprise her didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d be happy with anything, she had expectations... u would run into these situations if she were your vanilla gf anyway.   \n\nIf you want to keep seeing her, act like a vanilla bf would act.  Crawl back, get her what she wants and have some wild makeup sex.   It\u2019s not ur fault and she\u2019s not a B... just unaligned expectations - and that happens in any realm of life.\n\nEdit to add:  I actually think she\u2019s being more \u201creal\u201d to show u her disappointment cuz u can bet she would show her disappointment if u were her real bf too.

You sound like you have a good job and make money.  You should be using your wealth to buy bottle service at high end clubs (the club promoters would be sending you hot girls from the club in exchange for paying for a bottle service), you then offer to take these girls on fun dates or vacations . \n\nOn second thought just spend all your money on high end whores/sugar babies if you really don\u2019t think you could ever improve yourself enough to land a quality girl in regular dating. \n\nMost of the responses are spot on, this girls behavior is so bad because you repeatedly allow it and encourage it.

Just look at how many awesome people there are in these threads, talking about how much they love their sugar daddy, how he surprised them with some small gift and it made them swoon. Sorry to be a negative person but what's going on here is not going to get better. You can't fix this. And really, the great thing about a sugar relationship is you can just break it off. You paid what you owed, your karma is clean. \n\nThat's my belief. I just really think you can do better and it's not OK to be in a relationship where you're being treated that way.

Just look at how many awesome people there are in these threads, talking about how much they love their sugar daddy, how he surprised them with some small gift and it made them swoon. Sorry to be a negative person but what's going on here is not going to get better. You can't fix this. And really, the great thing about a sugar relationship is you can just break it off. You paid what you owed, your karma is clean. \n\nThat's my belief. I just really think you can do better and it's not OK to be in a relationship where you're being treated that way.

That type lives to be mean to women online as they are cowards in the real world. . \n\nWould an occasional real SD who happened upon this forum stick around for the cruelty and depravity seen here? I think not. \ud83e\udd14 \ud83d\ude12 \n\nFact: Entitled guys like that wear the acronym SD like it\u2019s a badge of honor and stick around for the sport of delusion and cruelty. They take glee in insulting women and brag about treating them as a disposable object.\n\nI\u2019m preaching to the choir but they not only lack wealth but any character or shame  in their bitter stingy souls and bank accounts. . Obviously as they are not hiding their assholery. \n\nThey aren\u2019t even a poor yet kind man one might encounter who pretends to be wealthy online as a form of escapism. Nope: They are TOXIC and cruel. They do not deserve our attention. Just like stupid, u cannot change mean and stingy. They will carry on being this way online unless a mod bans them.\n\nI make fun of them in their own language . Bad grammar and misuse of words as well, so they understand better.",
