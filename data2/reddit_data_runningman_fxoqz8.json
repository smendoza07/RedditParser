I find her so endearing and different, I look forward to new episodes cause I know she do something different every time.\n\nI just came from watching Michuri where Somin guested. And only Somin get to tease Jae Suk until he\u2019s flustered. I adore their friendship, it was a really good casting by the Running Man PDs.",

It\u2019s no shade to her at all to say that. \n\nAlso, I rarely comment in this sub so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m just here to circlejerk over Somin. I do genuinely think she\u2019s a great addition and has worked so hard and has proven herself as a funny person rather than just another woman in variety to be seen as a love interest. It\u2019s quite hard to do.\n\nLastly, Somin DOES get a great deal of hate; so much so haters are even getting her brother involved. However, I\u2019ve seen hate directed at Jihyo too, and when I do, I defend her. \n\nCriticism of Somin is fine; you can have your own opinion, but if you\u2019re going to act harshly then people will downvote you. Forgive me if I\u2019m wrong but I haven\u2019t seen Jihyo hate get upvoted on here either.",
