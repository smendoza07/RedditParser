I was a little nervous yesterday because it was really big change for me and I didnt knew how it will be. I had always got long hair.\n\nI am really happy with this haircut :)\n\nI hope this can inspire someone.\n\n[comparison](https://preview.redd.it/736na1a4fh251.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1aad2859b24092b39e2575e5f3f99a4e8d75c510)",
