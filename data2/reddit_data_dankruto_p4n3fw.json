He could've already had the Shukaku sealed in him by then, in fact, it's likely a parallel to Naruto (Who btw already had his \"whiskers\" when he was born, not because he was already the jinchuriki, but because he was born to Kushina who was).\n\nWe know his mother died when he was born, and when we see him as an infant, his mother is already clearly dying next to him.\n\nThe power she gave him is also ridiculously powerful for a regular ninja to do. It's not at all unrealistic to assume that his mother was the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nRasa (Gaara's dad) only has those eyes when he's using his gold dust / magnet release abilities. Gaara has them 24/7 likely because the autonomous ultimate protection his mother gave him is constantly activated, which is of course also a magnet release ability, and is an ability exactly like the Shukaku's abilities. It would be pretty weird to assume she WASN'T the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nWe know Rasa wasn't because he literally used his abilities to fight the Shukaku and keep him at bay, and was the only person who could keep the village safe if the Shukaku attacked.\n\n\"This is the third child and the first compatible one.\" That's what was said when Gaara was born. Chances are he already had the Shukaku sealed inside him even in the earliest picture we have of him as an infant, with his mother dying at his side likely because she was the previous Jinchuriki and had to transfer it to his son, imparting her final power/wishes to keep him safe, just like Kushina did.\n\nWhether she was the previous Jinchuriki or not, we can't know for certain, but we do know Gaara's eyes are most likely from the power she gave him, which is constantly activated, or from the Shukaku, who's powers also revolve around magnet release. The way Rasa's eyes only get that black eyeliner when he's using his magnet release abilities should be a good hint for this.",

Also,  this is purely my own headcanon, I'd always assumed the reason Naruto was raised as an orphan instead of within the hokage household was so that it would be much harder for people,  namely the Akatsuki, to find out he was a jinchuriki, but I guess Danzo spoiled those plans.\n\nEDIT: Now that I think about it, my Akatsuki theory makes no sense since Jiraiya was the one who found out about the Akatsuki kidnapping jinchuriki around the time of the chuunin exams",

He could've already had the Shukaku sealed in him by then, in fact, it's likely a parallel to Naruto (Who btw already had his \"whiskers\" when he was born, not because he was already the jinchuriki, but because he was born to Kushina who was).\n\nWe know his mother died when he was born, and when we see him as an infant, his mother is already clearly dying next to him.\n\nThe power she gave him is also ridiculously powerful for a regular ninja to do. It's not at all unrealistic to assume that his mother was the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nRasa (Gaara's dad) only has those eyes when he's using his gold dust / magnet release abilities. Gaara has them 24/7 likely because the autonomous ultimate protection his mother gave him is constantly activated, which is of course also a magnet release ability, and is an ability exactly like the Shukaku's abilities. It would be pretty weird to assume she WASN'T the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nWe know Rasa wasn't because he literally used his abilities to fight the Shukaku and keep him at bay, and was the only person who could keep the village safe if the Shukaku attacked.\n\n\"This is the third child and the first compatible one.\" That's what was said when Gaara was born. Chances are he already had the Shukaku sealed inside him even in the earliest picture we have of him as an infant, with his mother dying at his side likely because she was the previous Jinchuriki and had to transfer it to his son, imparting her final power/wishes to keep him safe, just like Kushina did.\n\nWhether she was the previous Jinchuriki or not, we can't know for certain, but we do know Gaara's eyes are most likely from the power she gave him, which is constantly activated, or from the Shukaku, who's powers also revolve around magnet release. The way Rasa's eyes only get that black eyeliner when he's using his magnet release abilities should be a good hint for this.",

He could've already had the Shukaku sealed in him by then, in fact, it's likely a parallel to Naruto (Who btw already had his \"whiskers\" when he was born, not because he was already the jinchuriki, but because he was born to Kushina who was).\n\nWe know his mother died when he was born, and when we see him as an infant, his mother is already clearly dying next to him.\n\nThe power she gave him is also ridiculously powerful for a regular ninja to do. It's not at all unrealistic to assume that his mother was the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nRasa (Gaara's dad) only has those eyes when he's using his gold dust / magnet release abilities. Gaara has them 24/7 likely because the autonomous ultimate protection his mother gave him is constantly activated, which is of course also a magnet release ability, and is an ability exactly like the Shukaku's abilities. It would be pretty weird to assume she WASN'T the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nWe know Rasa wasn't because he literally used his abilities to fight the Shukaku and keep him at bay, and was the only person who could keep the village safe if the Shukaku attacked.\n\n\"This is the third child and the first compatible one.\" That's what was said when Gaara was born. Chances are he already had the Shukaku sealed inside him even in the earliest picture we have of him as an infant, with his mother dying at his side likely because she was the previous Jinchuriki and had to transfer it to his son, imparting her final power/wishes to keep him safe, just like Kushina did.\n\nWhether she was the previous Jinchuriki or not, we can't know for certain, but we do know Gaara's eyes are most likely from the power she gave him, which is constantly activated, or from the Shukaku, who's powers also revolve around magnet release. The way Rasa's eyes only get that black eyeliner when he's using his magnet release abilities should be a good hint for this.",

Also,  this is purely my own headcanon, I'd always assumed the reason Naruto was raised as an orphan instead of within the hokage household was so that it would be much harder for people,  namely the Akatsuki, to find out he was a jinchuriki, but I guess Danzo spoiled those plans.\n\nEDIT: Now that I think about it, my Akatsuki theory makes no sense since Jiraiya was the one who found out about the Akatsuki kidnapping jinchuriki around the time of the chuunin exams",

He could've already had the Shukaku sealed in him by then, in fact, it's likely a parallel to Naruto (Who btw already had his \"whiskers\" when he was born, not because he was already the jinchuriki, but because he was born to Kushina who was).\n\nWe know his mother died when he was born, and when we see him as an infant, his mother is already clearly dying next to him.\n\nThe power she gave him is also ridiculously powerful for a regular ninja to do. It's not at all unrealistic to assume that his mother was the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nRasa (Gaara's dad) only has those eyes when he's using his gold dust / magnet release abilities. Gaara has them 24/7 likely because the autonomous ultimate protection his mother gave him is constantly activated, which is of course also a magnet release ability, and is an ability exactly like the Shukaku's abilities. It would be pretty weird to assume she WASN'T the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nWe know Rasa wasn't because he literally used his abilities to fight the Shukaku and keep him at bay, and was the only person who could keep the village safe if the Shukaku attacked.\n\n\"This is the third child and the first compatible one.\" That's what was said when Gaara was born. Chances are he already had the Shukaku sealed inside him even in the earliest picture we have of him as an infant, with his mother dying at his side likely because she was the previous Jinchuriki and had to transfer it to his son, imparting her final power/wishes to keep him safe, just like Kushina did.\n\nWhether she was the previous Jinchuriki or not, we can't know for certain, but we do know Gaara's eyes are most likely from the power she gave him, which is constantly activated, or from the Shukaku, who's powers also revolve around magnet release. The way Rasa's eyes only get that black eyeliner when he's using his magnet release abilities should be a good hint for this.",

Dude was born weak asf and his mom died during birth, causing his father to resent him and abuse him, then got a bijuu stuck in him who didn't only reside in him, but literally torment him to the point of sleepless nights, while also having the entire village ostracise him. The only person he ever trusted then turns out to be an opp and commits sepuku right in front of him.\n\nAn assassination attempt in an 8 year old's life? Damn.",

He could've already had the Shukaku sealed in him by then, in fact, it's likely a parallel to Naruto (Who btw already had his \"whiskers\" when he was born, not because he was already the jinchuriki, but because he was born to Kushina who was).\n\nWe know his mother died when he was born, and when we see him as an infant, his mother is already clearly dying next to him.\n\nThe power she gave him is also ridiculously powerful for a regular ninja to do. It's not at all unrealistic to assume that his mother was the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nRasa (Gaara's dad) only has those eyes when he's using his gold dust / magnet release abilities. Gaara has them 24/7 likely because the autonomous ultimate protection his mother gave him is constantly activated, which is of course also a magnet release ability, and is an ability exactly like the Shukaku's abilities. It would be pretty weird to assume she WASN'T the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nWe know Rasa wasn't because he literally used his abilities to fight the Shukaku and keep him at bay, and was the only person who could keep the village safe if the Shukaku attacked.\n\n\"This is the third child and the first compatible one.\" That's what was said when Gaara was born. Chances are he already had the Shukaku sealed inside him even in the earliest picture we have of him as an infant, with his mother dying at his side likely because she was the previous Jinchuriki and had to transfer it to his son, imparting her final power/wishes to keep him safe, just like Kushina did.\n\nWhether she was the previous Jinchuriki or not, we can't know for certain, but we do know Gaara's eyes are most likely from the power she gave him, which is constantly activated, or from the Shukaku, who's powers also revolve around magnet release. The way Rasa's eyes only get that black eyeliner when he's using his magnet release abilities should be a good hint for this.",

He could've already had the Shukaku sealed in him by then, in fact, it's likely a parallel to Naruto (Who btw already had his \"whiskers\" when he was born, not because he was already the jinchuriki, but because he was born to Kushina who was).\n\nWe know his mother died when he was born, and when we see him as an infant, his mother is already clearly dying next to him.\n\nThe power she gave him is also ridiculously powerful for a regular ninja to do. It's not at all unrealistic to assume that his mother was the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nRasa (Gaara's dad) only has those eyes when he's using his gold dust / magnet release abilities. Gaara has them 24/7 likely because the autonomous ultimate protection his mother gave him is constantly activated, which is of course also a magnet release ability, and is an ability exactly like the Shukaku's abilities. It would be pretty weird to assume she WASN'T the previous Jinchuriki.\n\nWe know Rasa wasn't because he literally used his abilities to fight the Shukaku and keep him at bay, and was the only person who could keep the village safe if the Shukaku attacked.\n\n\"This is the third child and the first compatible one.\" That's what was said when Gaara was born. Chances are he already had the Shukaku sealed inside him even in the earliest picture we have of him as an infant, with his mother dying at his side likely because she was the previous Jinchuriki and had to transfer it to his son, imparting her final power/wishes to keep him safe, just like Kushina did.\n\nWhether she was the previous Jinchuriki or not, we can't know for certain, but we do know Gaara's eyes are most likely from the power she gave him, which is constantly activated, or from the Shukaku, who's powers also revolve around magnet release. The way Rasa's eyes only get that black eyeliner when he's using his magnet release abilities should be a good hint for this.",
