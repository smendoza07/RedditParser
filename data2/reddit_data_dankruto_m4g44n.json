People think naruto is strong but without guy sensei they would have lost also the power of guy sensei into kurama really helped considering his strength makes punches so fast and strong they give the illusion of a giant tiger, also he punches so hard the creates fire balls as seen when he fought kissame, Proving that he is the strongest ninja ever.",

People think naruto is strong but without guy sensei they would have lost also the power of guy sensei into kurama really helped considering his strength makes punches so fast and strong they give the illusion of a giant tiger, also he punches so hard the creates fire balls as seen when he fought kissame, Proving that he is the strongest ninja ever.",
