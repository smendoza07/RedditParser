I still havent gotten any POTSD because my SA profile is total trash.(but that is a whole different post) But in this current climate i couldnt imagine a M&G In person right now.( i just wanna stay safe and have others be safe)\n\nBut i also realize personally i am stalling while i go through the group glossary and files to ensure i understand.\n\nI hope people can become more honest.
