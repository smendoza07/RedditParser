There are many times when we hear her say \"i'm just working hard\" \"i'm doing my job\", unlike many others think, she don't shows up to RM to play, but to contribute and lift the burden from her seniors, and that's why they adore her.",

Shows in Korea cannot survive that. Or, my unpopular opinion, is that they know who do this, and they are not RM fans... so adressing someone else's fans is a bit...",

Sure with Covid it might not happen until a vaccine is developped, but it is not impossible in the near future. Thousands of people buying a 50$ concert ticket? Yeah that's a lot of money.\n\nI too wish the members or the company would do something like take legal actions, but unfortunately I do think SBS values money more than their contractual employees. That's how most big business operate, sadly. The PDs have 0 say in this, unless they want to get fired by SBS.",

Many people thought that SJH was so special and somin proved them wrong (they're angry and can't accept the truth and they need to hate someone to feel better). So are you saying that SJH is so funny and entertaining???? the thing she likes the most is sleep. Seriously do you think that she's so interesting??? She seems soulless and apatethic about evertything. My main point is that SJH always was so overrated.",

We don't actually know the numbers but they seem to amount to several hundreds at least to a few thousands, which SBS could see as significant. They had a fanmeeting in Vietnam and Indonesia in 2019. Sure with Covid it might not happen until a vaccine is developped, but it is not impossible in the near future. Thousands of people buying a 50$ concert ticket? Yeah that's a lot of money.\n\nI too wish the members or the company would do something like take legal actions, but unfortunately I do think SBS values money more than their contractual employees. That's how most big business operate, sadly. The PDs have 0 say in this, unless they want to get fired by SBS.",

Sure with Covid it might not happen until a vaccine is developped, but it is not impossible in the near future. Thousands of people buying a 50$ concert ticket? Yeah that's a lot of money.\n\nI too wish the members or the company would do something like take legal actions, but unfortunately I do think SBS values money more than their contractual employees. That's how most big business operate, sadly. The PDs have 0 say in this, unless they want to get fired by SBS.",

Sure with Covid it might not happen until a vaccine is developped, but it is not impossible in the near future. Thousands of people buying a 50$ concert ticket? Yeah that's a lot of money.\n\nI too wish the members or the company would do something like take legal actions, but unfortunately I do think SBS values money more than their contractual employees. That's how most big business operate, sadly. The PDs have 0 say in this, unless they want to get fired by SBS.",

So are you saying that SJH is so funny and entertaining???? the thing she likes the most is sleep. Seriously do you think that she's so interesting??? She seems soulless and apatethic about evertything. My main point is that SJH always was so overrated.",

I dont find anyting intersting about SJH sorry, but yes, its my opinion, that's why comments exist for telling the people's opinion.",
