I think your hair just looks fuller with in the longer pic.\n\nIf you do want to go short, I recommend you change it up a bit. I'm a big fan of undercuts of any kind, it's a short hair look that breaks up the monotony of it all being the same length. If you can keep the same fullness, thickness, 'weight-y-ness' of the long hair, I think the short all same length could work too.",
