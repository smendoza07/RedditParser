    "body": "There are so many disaster stories on here, I just went back to look at the message from SA that I saved as a screenshot so I can share with the group.\n\nShe was a new SB. Very hot. I actually figured she was a fake profile because she was so hot...and it was a brand new profile. She was online, so I favorited her profile and kept scrolling. She sent the first message:\n\n\u201cDo you want to be my SugarDaddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like a good idea to me! Would you like to meet somewhere near \u2018her city\u2019 so we can see if we both want to take this further?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would you like to meet?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about \u2018Place A\u2019 or \u2018Place B\u2019?\u201d\n\nFrom me again: \u201cMy name is \u2018real name\u2019 by the way. 111-111-1111 is my cell if you would like to start texting.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t message much on SA because it seems so easy to get your account banned.\n\nI ask for an in-person meeting so I can weed out the fake profiles.\n\nThis message exchange led to my current SB. We are both madly in love with each other. I pay her a weekly allowance. I honestly might marry this girl! I would keep paying the allowance forever...even if we got married.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share this positive interaction for anyone who is struggling with meeting someone on SA.\n\nGood luck to my SLF family!",
