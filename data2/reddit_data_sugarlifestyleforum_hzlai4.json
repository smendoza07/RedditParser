    "body": "Had this brief exchange with a POT SB a few minutes ago...\n\nMe: What kind of experience are you having on the site, so far?\n\nHer: People gettin mad that I don\u2019t wanna instantly meet\n\nMe: Are you seeking an online-only thing?\n\nHer: Not only, I\u2019m just not tryna jump right into things\n\nMe: Yeah, that makes sense. Some guys (and some girls too, it seems) treat this as a hookup site, and that's simply not its purpose.\n\nHer: No it\u2019s not\n\nAlso her: My dude, is there any way you can help me out with my phone bill? We can meet up sometime this week, I just gotta get it paid ..\n\nMe, right before I blocked her:  The site also isn't meant to be an instant ATM. You should work on your method.",

A man could become a daddy simply on offering free or discounted mechanic fees instead of an allowance.  Figure how to become a mortician,  car mech, and wireless provider all in a single business and you're the next Elon musk.",
