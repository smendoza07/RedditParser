Once that\u2019s done I\u2019ll throw some paste in it and add some hair spray and I\u2019m good.\n\nI will warn you though that depending on how much product you use the bangs can come down over the day. It\u2019s pretty difficult at first to find the line between too much product and too little but just apply in small amounts until you\u2019re used to it.",
