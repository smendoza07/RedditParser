Even if Itachi had just knocked him out with a genjutsu, how were they going to get him out of there without the whole thing looking suspicious as hell? Were they gonna try hiding them under their cloaks or something clich\u00e9 like that? \n\nEver since you mentioned indoctrination or Itachi trying to recruit Naruto to the Akatsuki, all I can imagine is Naruto opening the door and Kisame says \"Hey kid wanna learn a new jutsu?\" and Itachi follows it up with \"We ran into your sensei Jiraiya at a bar, and he mentioned that you were his apprentice, and that you want him to teach you a new technique, but he said he doesn't really feel like training you at the moment, so we offered to train you instead, and he said yes.\" And Naruto is so ecstatic to finally be getting some attention and to make some progress in his training that he agrees to go along with them despite all the red flags surrounding the situation.",

Saying that would just incite panic in the population.

Not only does he abstain from interfering in their matches (both in the hotel, despite the fact that they were supposed to be in the middle of a mission to capture a jinchuuriki, and during Itachi's final battle against Sasuke), he also actively prevents others from interfering as well, no matter how much I'm sure he'd rather leap in and join the fight.\n\nAnd while this might not seem like a significant detail, I'd say the fact that Itachi allows Kisame to walk behind him when they are travelling speaks volumes; how much trust does it take for a Shinobi, let alone a former ANBU, to turn their back to someone, especially considering the circumstances surrounding their partnership?\n\nWhen you take both of their histories into account, it becomes even more intriguing; the parallels between their stories (both killed their comrades on the orders of their village's leadership; for Kisame it was to prevent them from getting captured and tortured for information, for Itachi it was to prevent the coup d'\u00e9tat) and their subsequent reputations as kin-slayers, these factors would naturally be seen as reasons for them not to trust each other, and Kisame straight up said as much upon their first meeting when he held Samehada mere inches from Itachi's throat. Yet at the same time I think the fact that they've had those similar experiences led to a sort of mutual understanding between the two of them, and I think that's part of the reason why they developed such a deep sense of respect for one another over the course of their partnership.\n\nOh shit, looks like I got carried away and wrote an entire essay analyzing their relationship. Sorry about that. Anyway yeah I love Kisame and I love the dynamic between him and Itachi (their height difference tho).\n\nThanks for listening to my TEDtalk.",

How else does he pay for that apartment he has? We all know Lord 3rd Hokage really didn't care much for children. Lol",

I mean, he's the Hokage's son, they couldn't have been broke. Then again, that might be exactly the reason why--what with them concealing the identity of his parents from him. Also, Minato didn't exactly have time to write a will leaving everything to his newborn son before he died. Still, it bothers me that Naruto didn't have a better place to live.",

Not to mention the fact that he would be way too busy and focused on his training and getting revenge on his brother to bother arguing on behalf of a clan that consists of only himself at that point in time, and while you could argue it could help him in his effort to restore the Uchiha Clan later in life, killing Itachi always took precedence--he was willing to allow Orochimaru to use him as a meat puppet if it meant he got to avenge his dead family. When he finally did succeed in that quest, he immediately learned the truth about Itachi, and at that point he was so far beyond the point of being willing to negotiate anything with Konoha's leadership that just the prospect of it is laughable. \n\nKakashi on the other hand is interesting, because he had the Fourth Hokage as a mentor, and he worked in the ANBU, which brought him into contact with Yamato, who worked for Root at the time, and they ended up running into each other on enough missions that Kakashi's gotten a better glimpse of the hidden inner workings of Konoha's government than probably any Clan Head. Then again, this is Kakashi; I can already imagine him pulling out his well-loved copy of Icha Icha Paradise in the middle of a boring ass meeting and getting chewed out for it.",

He was trying to prevent Naruto's capture, signal why and what the group was after to someone with authority to take care of the situation like Kakashi and Jiraiya. Though if it had been Naruto capture you can bet he probably had a slew of other plans to deal with Naruto without handing him over.

Even if Itachi had just knocked him out with a genjutsu, how were they going to get him out of there without the whole thing looking suspicious as hell? Were they gonna try hiding them under their cloaks or something clich\u00e9 like that? \n\nEver since you mentioned indoctrination or Itachi trying to recruit Naruto to the Akatsuki, all I can imagine is Naruto opening the door and Kisame says \"Hey kid wanna learn a new jutsu?\" and Itachi follows it up with \"We ran into your sensei Jiraiya at a bar, and he mentioned that you were his apprentice, and that you want him to teach you a new technique, but he said he doesn't really feel like training you at the moment, so we offered to train you instead, and he said yes.\" And Naruto is so ecstatic to finally be getting some attention and to make some progress in his training that he agrees to go along with them despite all the red flags surrounding the situation.",

Not only does he abstain from interfering in their matches (both in the hotel, despite the fact that they were supposed to be in the middle of a mission to capture a jinchuuriki, and during Itachi's final battle against Sasuke), he also actively prevents others from interfering as well, no matter how much I'm sure he'd rather leap in and join the fight.\n\nAnd while this might not seem like a significant detail, I'd say the fact that Itachi allows Kisame to walk behind him when they are travelling speaks volumes; how much trust does it take for a Shinobi, let alone a former ANBU, to turn their back to someone, especially considering the circumstances surrounding their partnership?\n\nWhen you take both of their histories into account, it becomes even more intriguing; the parallels between their stories (both killed their comrades on the orders of their village's leadership; for Kisame it was to prevent them from getting captured and tortured for information, for Itachi it was to prevent the coup d'\u00e9tat) and their subsequent reputations as kin-slayers, these factors would naturally be seen as reasons for them not to trust each other, and Kisame straight up said as much upon their first meeting when he held Samehada mere inches from Itachi's throat. Yet at the same time I think the fact that they've had those similar experiences led to a sort of mutual understanding between the two of them, and I think that's part of the reason why they developed such a deep sense of respect for one another over the course of their partnership.\n\nOh shit, looks like I got carried away and wrote an entire essay analyzing their relationship. Sorry about that. Anyway yeah I love Kisame and I love the dynamic between him and Itachi (their height difference tho).\n\nThanks for listening to my TEDtalk.",

I mean, he's the Hokage's son, they couldn't have been broke. Then again, that might be exactly the reason why--what with them concealing the identity of his parents from him. Also, Minato didn't exactly have time to write a will leaving everything to his newborn son before he died. Still, it bothers me that Naruto didn't have a better place to live.",

Not to mention the fact that he would be way too busy and focused on his training and getting revenge on his brother to bother arguing on behalf of a clan that consists of only himself at that point in time, and while you could argue it could help him in his effort to restore the Uchiha Clan later in life, killing Itachi always took precedence--he was willing to allow Orochimaru to use him as a meat puppet if it meant he got to avenge his dead family. When he finally did succeed in that quest, he immediately learned the truth about Itachi, and at that point he was so far beyond the point of being willing to negotiate anything with Konoha's leadership that just the prospect of it is laughable. \n\nKakashi on the other hand is interesting, because he had the Fourth Hokage as a mentor, and he worked in the ANBU, which brought him into contact with Yamato, who worked for Root at the time, and they ended up running into each other on enough missions that Kakashi's gotten a better glimpse of the hidden inner workings of Konoha's government than probably any Clan Head. Then again, this is Kakashi; I can already imagine him pulling out his well-loved copy of Icha Icha Paradise in the middle of a boring ass meeting and getting chewed out for it.",

Not only does he abstain from interfering in their matches (both in the hotel, despite the fact that they were supposed to be in the middle of a mission to capture a jinchuuriki, and during Itachi's final battle against Sasuke), he also actively prevents others from interfering as well, no matter how much I'm sure he'd rather leap in and join the fight.\n\nAnd while this might not seem like a significant detail, I'd say the fact that Itachi allows Kisame to walk behind him when they are travelling speaks volumes; how much trust does it take for a Shinobi, let alone a former ANBU, to turn their back to someone, especially considering the circumstances surrounding their partnership?\n\nWhen you take both of their histories into account, it becomes even more intriguing; the parallels between their stories (both killed their comrades on the orders of their village's leadership; for Kisame it was to prevent them from getting captured and tortured for information, for Itachi it was to prevent the coup d'\u00e9tat) and their subsequent reputations as kin-slayers, these factors would naturally be seen as reasons for them not to trust each other, and Kisame straight up said as much upon their first meeting when he held Samehada mere inches from Itachi's throat. Yet at the same time I think the fact that they've had those similar experiences led to a sort of mutual understanding between the two of them, and I think that's part of the reason why they developed such a deep sense of respect for one another over the course of their partnership.\n\nOh shit, looks like I got carried away and wrote an entire essay analyzing their relationship. Sorry about that. Anyway yeah I love Kisame and I love the dynamic between him and Itachi (their height difference tho).\n\nThanks for listening to my TEDtalk.",

I mean, he's the Hokage's son, they couldn't have been broke. Then again, that might be exactly the reason why--what with them concealing the identity of his parents from him.

Not to mention the fact that he would be way too busy and focused on his training and getting revenge on his brother to bother arguing on behalf of a clan that consists of only himself at that point in time, and while you could argue it could help him in his effort to restore the Uchiha Clan later in life, killing Itachi always took precedence--he was willing to allow Orochimaru to use him as a meat puppet if it meant he got to avenge his dead family. When he finally did succeed in that quest, he immediately learned the truth about Itachi, and at that point he was so far beyond the point of being willing to negotiate anything with Konoha's leadership that just the prospect of it is laughable. \n\nKakashi on the other hand is interesting, because he had the Fourth Hokage as a mentor, and he worked in the ANBU, which brought him into contact with Yamato, who worked for Root at the time, and they ended up running into each other on enough missions that Kakashi's gotten a better glimpse of the hidden inner workings of Konoha's government than probably any Clan Head.

Even if Itachi had just knocked him out with a genjutsu, how were they going to get him out of there without the whole thing looking suspicious as hell? Were they gonna try hiding them under their cloaks or something clich\u00e9 like that? \n\nEver since you mentioned indoctrination or Itachi trying to recruit Naruto to the Akatsuki, all I can imagine is Naruto opening the door and Kisame says \"Hey kid wanna learn a new jutsu?\" and Itachi follows it up with \"We ran into your sensei Jiraiya at a bar, and he mentioned that you were his apprentice, and that you want him to teach you a new technique, but he said he doesn't really feel like training you at the moment, so we offered to train you instead, and he said yes.\" And Naruto is so ecstatic to finally be getting some attention and to make some progress in his training that he agrees to go along with them despite all the red flags surrounding the situation.",

I mean, he's the Hokage's son, they couldn't have been broke. Then again, that might be exactly the reason why--what with them concealing the identity of his parents from him.

Not to mention the fact that he would be way too busy and focused on his training and getting revenge on his brother to bother arguing on behalf of a clan that consists of only himself at that point in time, and while you could argue it could help him in his effort to restore the Uchiha Clan later in life, killing Itachi always took precedence--he was willing to allow Orochimaru to use him as a meat puppet if it meant he got to avenge his dead family. When he finally did succeed in that quest, he immediately learned the truth about Itachi, and at that point he was so far beyond the point of being willing to negotiate anything with Konoha's leadership that just the prospect of it is laughable. \n\nKakashi on the other hand is interesting, because he had the Fourth Hokage as a mentor, and he worked in the ANBU, which brought him into contact with Yamato, who worked for Root at the time, and they ended up running into each other on enough missions that Kakashi's gotten a better glimpse of the hidden inner workings of Konoha's government than probably any Clan Head. Then again, this is Kakashi; I can already imagine him pulling out his well-loved copy of Icha Icha Paradise in the middle of a boring ass meeting and getting chewed out for it.",

Even if Itachi had just knocked him out with a genjutsu, how were they going to get him out of there without the whole thing looking suspicious as hell? Were they gonna try hiding them under their cloaks or something clich\u00e9 like that? \n\nEver since you mentioned indoctrination or Itachi trying to recruit Naruto to the Akatsuki, all I can imagine is Naruto opening the door and Kisame says \"Hey kid wanna learn a new jutsu?\" and Itachi follows it up with \"We ran into your sensei Jiraiya at a bar, and he mentioned that you were his apprentice, and that you want him to teach you a new technique, but he said he doesn't really feel like training you at the moment, so we offered to train you instead, and he said yes.\" And Naruto is so ecstatic to finally be getting some attention and to make some progress in his training that he agrees to go along with them despite all the red flags surrounding the situation.",

I mean, he's the Hokage's son, they couldn't have been broke. Then again, that might be exactly the reason why--what with them concealing the identity of his parents from him.

Not to mention the fact that he would be way too busy and focused on his training and getting revenge on his brother to bother arguing on behalf of a clan that consists of only himself at that point in time, and while you could argue it could help him in his effort to restore the Uchiha Clan later in life, killing Itachi always took precedence--he was willing to allow Orochimaru to use him as a meat puppet if it meant he got to avenge his dead family. When he finally did succeed in that quest, he immediately learned the truth about Itachi, and at that point he was so far beyond the point of being willing to negotiate anything with Konoha's leadership that just the prospect of it is laughable. \n\nKakashi on the other hand is interesting, because he had the Fourth Hokage as a mentor, and he worked in the ANBU, which brought him into contact with Yamato, who worked for Root at the time, and they ended up running into each other on enough missions that Kakashi's gotten a better glimpse of the hidden inner workings of Konoha's government than probably any Clan Head. Then again, this is Kakashi; I can already imagine him pulling out his well-loved copy of Icha Icha Paradise in the middle of a boring ass meeting and getting chewed out for it.",

I mean, he's the Hokage's son, they couldn't have been broke. Then again, that might be exactly the reason why--what with them concealing the identity of his parents from him. Also, Minato didn't exactly have time to write a will leaving everything to his newborn son before he died. Still, it bothers me that Naruto didn't have a better place to live.",

Not to mention the fact that he would be way too busy and focused on his training and getting revenge on his brother to bother arguing on behalf of a clan that consists of only himself at that point in time, and while you could argue it could help him in his effort to restore the Uchiha Clan later in life, killing Itachi always took precedence--he was willing to allow Orochimaru to use him as a meat puppet if it meant he got to avenge his dead family. When he finally did succeed in that quest, he immediately learned the truth about Itachi, and at that point he was so far beyond the point of being willing to negotiate anything with Konoha's leadership that just the prospect of it is laughable. \n\nKakashi on the other hand is interesting, because he had the Fourth Hokage as a mentor, and he worked in the ANBU, which brought him into contact with Yamato, who worked for Root at the time, and they ended up running into each other on enough missions that Kakashi's gotten a better glimpse of the hidden inner workings of Konoha's government than probably any Clan Head. Then again, this is Kakashi; I can already imagine him pulling out his well-loved copy of Icha Icha Paradise in the middle of a boring ass meeting and getting chewed out for it.",
