Sure he got so much stronger over the years but to pull off a combo like that on a ninja that (I believe) is canonically stronger than him at that moment is just really impressive. \n\nToo bad it took another 500 something episodes for naruto to finally beat sasuke for real haha!",

The Sakura vs Shin and the Naruto/Sasuke vs Momo scenes in particular stick out in my mind. Does the show stop doing those well animated/choreographed fights eventually? \n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Naruto since I was a child, but it\u2019s no joke that 90% of the show is boring talking and stale/rigid fight scenes coming down to who can make the biggest fireball. All of my Naruto watching is essentially just looking forward to those cool scenes where they visibly change studios/style and if they end up taking that out completely I might just skip the anime and read a story outline somewhere",

The Sakura vs Shin and the Naruto/Sasuke vs Momo scenes in particular stick out in my mind. Does the show stop doing those well animated/choreographed fights eventually? \n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Naruto since I was a child, but it\u2019s no joke that 90% of the show is boring talking and stale/rigid fight scenes coming down to who can make the biggest fireball. All of my Naruto watching is essentially just looking forward to those cool scenes where they visibly change studios/style and if they end up taking that out completely I might just skip the anime and read a story outline somewhere",

The Sakura vs Shin and the Naruto/Sasuke vs Momo scenes in particular stick out in my mind. Does the show stop doing those well animated/choreographed fights eventually? \n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Naruto since I was a child, but it\u2019s no joke that 90% of the show is boring talking and stale/rigid fight scenes coming down to who can make the biggest fireball. All of my Naruto watching is essentially just looking forward to those cool scenes where they visibly change studios/style and if they end up taking that out completely I might just skip the anime and read a story outline somewhere",

The Sakura vs Shin and the Naruto/Sasuke vs Momo scenes in particular stick out in my mind. Does the show stop doing those well animated/choreographed fights eventually? \n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Naruto since I was a child, but it\u2019s no joke that 90% of the show is boring talking and stale/rigid fight scenes coming down to who can make the biggest fireball. All of my Naruto watching is essentially just looking forward to those cool scenes where they visibly change studios/style and if they end up taking that out completely I might just skip the anime and read a story outline somewhere",

The Sakura vs Shin and the Naruto/Sasuke vs Momo scenes in particular stick out in my mind. Does the show stop doing those well animated/choreographed fights eventually? \n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Naruto since I was a child, but it\u2019s no joke that 90% of the show is boring talking and stale/rigid fight scenes coming down to who can make the biggest fireball. All of my Naruto watching is essentially just looking forward to those cool scenes where they visibly change studios/style and if they end up taking that out completely I might just skip the anime and read a story outline somewhere",
