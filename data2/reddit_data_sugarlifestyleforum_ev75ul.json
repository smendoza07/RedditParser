    "body": "Writing this TLDR style because I don\u2019t want to expose myself.\n\nI recently went on a few dates with a POT who told me a lot about his previous SB.\n\nHe talked about her studies, her background, her body, her kinks and fetishes, what they used to do in bed. And then he showed me her LINKEDIN PROFILE! With her full name, picture and information.\n\nI\u2019ve also had POTs mention they\u2019ve had an arrangement with \u201cthe [job title] at [famous company]\u201d. And that it\u2019s OK to give details, \u201cshe put pictures of her face on SA so it\u2019s fine, she\u2019s not hiding\u201d\n\nSeriously, am I too sensitive or is this completely inappropriate? I always feel like I shouldn\u2019t know this type of information and feel bad for these girls.",

Another way to look at it is that he might be using this as a tactic to manipulate you into agreeing to all his demands. The girls LinkedIn profile might be some random girl that he looked up and is using it to manipulate you. Either way, very tacky and crass of him. Just block him on all platforms.",
