    "body": "Title says it all, SD has been insisting on overnights but refusing to entertain the idea of me having to pack a bag, make an excuse to my parents on who I\u2019m staying the night with, getting a friend to cover me, waking up at 6AM so he wakes up to me with makeup on and have three+ rounds of sex should raise the $$$ compared to a three hour lunch date?\n\nObviously when I mention this his reply is \u201cI don\u2019t want it to feel transactional/like escorting.\u201d \ud83d\ude44I\u2019m probably going to dump him completely, I\u2019m so sick of this stupid manipulation tactic of trying to play on SB\u2019s shame of being seen as fssw? \n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re BETTER than an escort, right? So why don\u2019t you, *taps forehead meme* charge 20% of what an escort charges? Because you\u2019re BETTER than them!\u201d\n\nAlso the bullshit of \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t want more money because we have a REAL connection!!\u201d By that logic, YOU shouldn\u2019t want more sex because we have a ReAl CoNnEcTiOn. But no, it\u2019s only me who should be content with my lot, but it\u2019s fine for you to be the one insisting on full sexual availability, 3+ rounds of sex per date, constant texting, companionship, platonic dates completely uncompensated, etc.\n\nEdit:\nAn insightful conversation with u/azurecole has revealed a lot of reasoning behind the responses to this. I think there are a lot of generous and thoughtful SD\u2019s who like to assume all other SD\u2019s are as great as them. So when they see threads of SB\u2019s complaining, the knee jerk response is to assume it\u2019s the SB who is the one in the wrong and the SD is as angelic as them. So let me just get this out here. The guy I\u2019m talking about is a dick. There was no \u201cunspoken trust\u201d or reciprocation for effort. Yes I\u2019m very \u201ctransactional\u201d but it\u2019s not the half of how aggressive he was in letting me know he was in it for the sex. If I didn\u2019t demand money I WOULDN\u2019T GET MONEY. It is GREAT that your SR has mutual trust and is so much better than ours, but try to keep in mind that shitty SD\u2019s exist. He wasn\u2019t a scammer, and he wasn\u2019t technically salt, but he was a dick. So when someone is complaining about an SD, they\u2019re not complaining about you. If you come across an SB complaining about something you as an SD wouldn\u2019t do, pat yourself on the back.",

How long have you been in this SR?  Sounds like its still pretty new.  I can't imagine doing an overnight with someone that early unless you really liked him.  Doesn't seem like you're there yet.\n\nSo just say you dont want to do overnights yet.  If he complains loudly, he can't respect boundaries or understand relational dynamics--and is worth dumping.",

The first time he asked I tried to gracefully ask what the PPM for platonic dates was and he said \u201cno sugar = no sugar \ud83d\ude08\u201d. The blatant disrespect for my time was astonishing.

As soon as I see \"the price\" referenced, I know I'm in for some fun \ud83e\udd23   Here's my two cents:\n\nI'm glad I've never had a \"the price is more for a sleepover\" SB.  In fact, I wouldn't have even known it was a thing if I didn't start reading slf.  Just not the sugar relationship vibe I'm going for, and no SB has ever asked me for this... really!\n\nBut!  I pretty quickly like to set up a dynamic of \"I do more for you than just our structured agreement (PPM)\".  Once I know I like an SB and want to keep her around, I'm covering her mani pedis, doordashing her lunch, volunteering to cover small bills she's stressing about.  If she returns in kind, delighting me in ways we never agree to, then I keep stepping it up.  Maybe it's not a surprise that an SB who knows her salon has my credit card to charge, or who knows I covered that bill for her, stays overnight without me having to ask, for PPM.  I suspect many of the guys who have SBs who do that, do the same.  I suspect many of the quid pro quo people are in super NSA SRs, whether by choice or not.\n\nI've only once had a truly NSA \"SR\".... she was fun during our dates, but we didn't speak at all between dates, I never did anything extra for her, she never did anything extra for me.  If I'd have asked her to stay overnight?  I'm 100% certain she would have asked for more PPM, and I understand why.\n\nAnyway, I think what these discussions always miss is what the rest of the SR is like.  u/ruphun's SRs are just like mine, for example, based on previous discussion. No wonder they just sleep over.  In a completely NSA minimal \"arrangement\"?  There's going to be quid pro quoing up in here.",

And then other SBs who have been in do-the-bare-minimum SRs rush to her defense.  I avoid NSA type SBs the moment I figure them out (usually).\n\nI do still wince when you call it a \"price\"... that's not how it feels in a good SR.

Are you calling it a \"price\" because the way he treats you, that's what it feels like?  Or is your SR uber-transactional because you're a \"price\" girl, and that's how you (consciously or unconsciously) steer your SRs?   It sounds like in this case, it's the former -- you feel like his behavior was transactional and disrespectful from the beginning, but you would otherwise be open to a more classic style SR?  \n\nThere are plenty of SBs and SDs who are \"price\" types, which of course is perfectly fine!  Just not what many of us are looking for, and their standards do not apply to my SRs.",

If there is that much trust and affection, why would the move to allowance not have happened?\n\nI vastly prefer monthly allowances, and talk about a MA/what I can provide monthly before even talking about a PPM to kick off the first couple of dates.  \n\nHowever - I have had two (long term, both over a year) SBs that wanted to stay on PPM due to their schedules.  These weren't exactly NSA;  they were more of, FWB with a strong physical & friendship/mentoring connection.  But we were not monogamous by any means, in an open relationship.\n\nKey thing here was - there was trust.  Part of a monthly allowance is the commitment - the SB can count on a certain amount.  In this case - both of the women knew they could always count on X visits a month if they had the time.  But there was no commitment on their side to it.",

One, because as an SD I have been asked for extra help from time to time because my SB needed it that week or wanted to buy something for herself and I never looked at those requests as an opportunity for a quid pro quo, as long as we'd been seeing each other for a while and developed some level of trust. I would only feel insulted if it were a brand new relationship. But more importantly I think there's a difference between the money and the sex. The money is all about what the SB wants and needs. Its purely support from me to her. Spending time together and having sex, on the other hand, should be about both of us and what we both want. Its not something she is doing *for* me in exchange for money. By the time we are spending the night together it should be something we both want to do and the topic of more PPM for overnights has never come up.\n\nThat kind of SR doesn't rise to the level of angelic in my book but you're absolutely right that not every SR is like this. If yours is more transactional and overnights aren't something you want to do, then there's nothing wrong with asking for a higher PPM or just saying no.",

If an SD made a post complaining, say about a SB asking for a million dollars or doing something stupid, would you comment on that post \u201cif it bothered you that much next her and stop complaining on the internet.\u201d The reason this sub exists is because SD\u2019s and SB\u2019s can\u2019t complain and discuss about sugar stuff to their acquaintances. It\u2019s a simple concept that people like to pretend they don\u2019t grasp when a poster complains about something they don\u2019t like. \n\nAlso the comment about beauty videos is so insulting. \u201cWhy are you complaining? It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got anything better to do!\u201d I have a degree to study for and a job that doesn\u2019t put up a fight paying me, starting your reply with \u201clmao it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got anything else to do\u201d is not it. \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like him, why do you continue to engage?\u201d Money. \u201cBelieve it or not I actually like watching that stupid shit with her.\u201d Yes, you\u2019re the SD.

Even one of your posts is complaining about a ridiculous SB you messaged, do you think he would comment on your post \u201cif it bothers you THAT much just move on and stop complaining on this sub!!!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m trying to extract the meaning of your comment. You\u2019re saying that seeing relationships as money = sex is harmful. Fair enough, that seems to be every SD on here. But in thinking of the relationship on those terms, I\u2019m \u201cdisrespecting what other SD\u2019s have to offer.\u201d I think this is a huge positive generalisation of \u201cSD\u2019s\u201d. What exactly do you think MY SD has to offer? You don\u2019t know, of course, but you\u2019re assuming he has something. Are you assuming he acts like you? Are you assuming he does all the thoughtful, kind things you\u2019ve done for your SB? Obviously if he was acting like you and I was acting so transactional, I\u2019d be the one in the wrong! \n\nNow I know you see this as me \u201cdefending my actions by saying he was worse.\u201d But the assumption in your comment that my SD has \u201cmany other things to offer\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t paying for sex, is paying for me to date him\u201d seems to be you projecting the relationship dynamics of your own SR, a past SR or the \u201cSLF ideal\u201d SR onto the relationship in this post. The idea that all SD\u2019s are generous and kind and compassionate, so all SB\u2019s should be adoring and never pushy for money and should just know in their hearts their SD will take care of them.

Are you calling it a \"price\" because the way he treats you, that's what it feels like?  Or is your SR uber-transactional because you're a \"price\" girl, and that's how you (consciously or unconsciously) steer your SRs?   It sounds like in this case, it's the former -- you feel like his behavior was transactional and disrespectful from the beginning, but you would otherwise be open to a more classic style SR?  \n\nThere are plenty of SBs and SDs who are \"price\" types, which of course is perfectly fine!  Just not what many of us are looking for, and their standards do not apply to my SRs.",

She has to put in all this extra time and effort so his sex life is more fulfilling but she shouldn\u2019t be compensated for that? How is that mutually beneficial?",

One, because as an SD I have been asked for extra help from time to time because my SB needed it that week or wanted to buy something for herself and I never looked at those requests as an opportunity for a quid pro quo, as long as we'd been seeing each other for a while and developed some level of trust. I would only feel insulted if it were a brand new relationship. But more importantly I think there's a difference between the money and the sex. The money is all about what the SB wants and needs. Its purely support from me to her. Spending time together and having sex, on the other hand, should be about both of us and what we both want. Its not something she is doing *for* me in exchange for money. By the time we are spending the night together it should be something we both want to do and the topic of more PPM for overnights has never come up.\n\nThat kind of SR doesn't rise to the level of angelic in my book but you're absolutely right that not every SR is like this. If yours is more transactional and overnights aren't something you want to do, then there's nothing wrong with asking for a higher PPM or just saying no.",

If an SD made a post complaining, say about a SB asking for a million dollars or doing something stupid, would you comment on that post \u201cif it bothered you that much next her and stop complaining on the internet.\u201d The reason this sub exists is because SD\u2019s and SB\u2019s can\u2019t complain and discuss about sugar stuff to their acquaintances. It\u2019s a simple concept that people like to pretend they don\u2019t grasp when a poster complains about something they don\u2019t like. \n\nAlso the comment about beauty videos is so insulting. \u201cWhy are you complaining?

Even one of your posts is complaining about a ridiculous SB you messaged, do you think he would comment on your post \u201cif it bothers you THAT much just move on and stop complaining on this sub!!!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m trying to extract the meaning of your comment. You\u2019re saying that seeing relationships as money = sex is harmful. Fair enough, that seems to be every SD on here.

What exactly do you think MY SD has to offer? You don\u2019t know, of course, but you\u2019re assuming he has something. Are you assuming he acts like you? Are you assuming he does all the thoughtful, kind things you\u2019ve done for your SB? Obviously if he was acting like you and I was acting so transactional, I\u2019d be the one in the wrong! \n\nNow I know you see this as me \u201cdefending my actions by saying he was worse.\u201d But the assumption in your comment that my SD has \u201cmany other things to offer\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t paying for sex, is paying for me to date him\u201d seems to be you projecting the relationship dynamics of your own SR, a past SR or the \u201cSLF ideal\u201d SR onto the relationship in this post. The idea that all SD\u2019s are generous and kind and compassionate, so all SB\u2019s should be adoring and never pushy for money and should just know in their hearts their SD will take care of them. How idyllic.",

Often, on the internet, people try to minimize their culpability and maximize the responsibility of the other party. You have an excuse for every cuplable behavior you exhibit.\n\nI'm saying your nickle and diming is as much to blame as his lewdness. You bring up his not wanting to pay your PPM if there's no sex but then are mad when he won't pay more PPM for more sex. It's hypocritical and it's all antithetical to sugar dating.\n\nThere are some disgusting men who pretend to be SDs. And there are some manipulative women parading as SBs.

I\u2019ve never asked for full PPM for platonic meets, I used that as a hypothetical counter to your idea that most SD\u2019s are paying for dates rather than sex. The fact that almost no SD would have the same prices for sex and no sex combats that idea. If you were referring to me refusing to meet him platonically when he refused to pay for a platonic meet, no, I don\u2019t meet SD\u2019s for free. That\u2019s not sugar dating.  \n\nThe comments about you not trusting me because this is only being told from my perspective, fair enough. But calling me \u201cdefensive\u201d is puzzlingly redundant. You\u2019ve  called me manipulative, \u201cgross\u201d, and criticised my actions and the presumed motivations behind them.

One, because as an SD I have been asked for extra help from time to time because my SB needed it that week or wanted to buy something for herself and I never looked at those requests as an opportunity for a quid pro quo, as long as we'd been seeing each other for a while and developed some level of trust. I would only feel insulted if it were a brand new relationship. But more importantly I think there's a difference between the money and the sex. The money is all about what the SB wants and needs. Its purely support from me to her. Spending time together and having sex, on the other hand, should be about both of us and what we both want. Its not something she is doing *for* me in exchange for money. By the time we are spending the night together it should be something we both want to do and the topic of more PPM for overnights has never come up.\n\nThat kind of SR doesn't rise to the level of angelic in my book but you're absolutely right that not every SR is like this. If yours is more transactional and overnights aren't something you want to do, then there's nothing wrong with asking for a higher PPM or just saying no.",

What I took from his comment was the incredibly unhelpful \u201cif you don\u2019t like it move on and don\u2019t complain about it!\u201d Like somehow he stopped understanding that 90% of this sub is people complaining because they can\u2019t complain to normal people, and he only cares when it\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t like. Even one of your posts is complaining about a ridiculous SB you messaged, do you think he would comment on your post \u201cif it bothers you THAT much just move on and stop complaining on this sub!!!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m trying to extract the meaning of your comment. You\u2019re saying that seeing relationships as money = sex is harmful. Fair enough, that seems to be every SD on here. But in thinking of the relationship on those terms, I\u2019m \u201cdisrespecting what other SD\u2019s have to offer.\u201d I think this is a huge positive generalisation of \u201cSD\u2019s\u201d. What exactly do you think MY SD has to offer? You don\u2019t know, of course, but you\u2019re assuming he has something. Are you assuming he acts like you? Are you assuming he does all the thoughtful, kind things you\u2019ve done for your SB? Obviously if he was acting like you and I was acting so transactional, I\u2019d be the one in the wrong! \n\nNow I know you see this as me \u201cdefending my actions by saying he was worse.\u201d But the assumption in your comment that my SD has \u201cmany other things to offer\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t paying for sex, is paying for me to date him\u201d seems to be you projecting the relationship dynamics of your own SR, a past SR or the \u201cSLF ideal\u201d SR onto the relationship in this post. The idea that all SD\u2019s are generous and kind and compassionate, so all SB\u2019s should be adoring and never pushy for money and should just know in their hearts their SD will take care of them. How idyllic.",

You bring up his not wanting to pay your PPM if there's no sex but then are mad when he won't pay more PPM for more sex. It's hypocritical and it's all antithetical to sugar dating.\n\nThere are some disgusting men who pretend to be SDs. And there are some manipulative women parading as SBs.

The fact that almost no SD would have the same prices for sex and no sex combats that idea. If you were referring to me refusing to meet him platonically when he refused to pay for a platonic meet, no, I don\u2019t meet SD\u2019s for free. That\u2019s not sugar dating.  \n\nThe comments about you not trusting me because this is only being told from my perspective, fair enough.

Are you calling it a \"price\" because the way he treats you, that's what it feels like?  Or is your SR uber-transactional because you're a \"price\" girl, and that's how you (consciously or unconsciously) steer your SRs?   It sounds like in this case, it's the former -- you feel like his behavior was transactional and disrespectful from the beginning, but you would otherwise be open to a more classic style SR?  \n\nThere are plenty of SBs and SDs who are \"price\" types, which of course is perfectly fine!  Just not what many of us are looking for, and their standards do not apply to my SRs.",

The fact that almost no SD would have the same prices for sex and no sex combats that idea.

Are you calling it a \"price\" because the way he treats you, that's what it feels like?  Or is your SR uber-transactional because you're a \"price\" girl, and that's how you (consciously or unconsciously) steer your SRs?
