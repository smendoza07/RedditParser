    "body": "I\u2019m pretty excited to see him. So this guy, who was one of my very first dates in the bowl, nearly went broke trying to provide for me. He helped me move into my apartment and we had a good run until he confessed sheepishly that he really can\u2019t afford my allowance. \n\nHe always gave me \u201cthings.\u201d I assumed because he owns his own company and can write them off. But that wasn\u2019t what I needed so we ended it and I found another. \n\nWe stopped seeing each other and he moved to another state for work. His family is here and he comes to town a few times a year (his buddy is flying him private before you mention to c word).\n\nHe bring me gifts like nespresso pods and gummies from a Nevada, he changed out my shower hardware and he does all the repairs around my house (I keep a running honey-do list for him), makes me laugh and is really into pleasing. Like super into it, which I found uncomfortable, but look forward to now. \n\nHe has taught me a lot and I\u2019ve called him a few times when I was really sad. He has more patience than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. Has never said an unkind thing to me and I am completely myself around him. I truly enjoy his laid-back and lighthearted personality. He\u2019s a good man. \n\nHe\u2019s my Splenda and my true friend and I like him a lot. \n\nWhy did I write this: Aren\u2019t you just glad I\u2019m not suicidal?",

Took me out to dinner for my birthday last year because it\u2019s close to Christmas and everyone is home with their family. We can lay in bed and belly laugh for hours. I\u2019ve painted two large pieces for him and he\u2019s given me very thoughtful gifts. We met through work and I adore him. I know he loved me and maybe he still does \u2014 we stay in touch. I\u2019ve had deep pocket daddies and I\u2019ve had dudes who pretended to have what it took to be in the bowl. Everyone is different, but this guy is special to me. \n\n(LOL also realizing I\u2019m posting this on my main and not my SB account, but whatever.)",

Sometimes I\u2019ve also traveled with them and they fit the bill but we agree to no intimacy and no allowance. Again, these are friends I\u2019d see regularly just because we\u2019ve got great chemistry and I genuinely enjoy emotionally supporting people in my life and being there for them. Likewise, even though we don\u2019t do weekly allowances they\u2019re usually the first ones to offer to help in emergencies because they tend to be the first person I feel comfortable telling. I\u2019ve also heard of them referred to as \u2018floaters\u2019.\n\nI agree yours sounds more like a Splenda daddy but just because he doesn\u2019t have the cash doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t positively contribute to your life. That honey-do list is still saving you money and if you enjoy the company more power to you. As long as you both find it beneficial I don\u2019t see the issue.",

                                            "body": "It\u2019s a huge misconception likely spread by those who see no value in a sugar relationship without intimacy\u2014a projection of their own belief and value system. The other reinforcement of this is most people just ignorantly repeat the narrative they\u2019ve heard others on here say. I\u2019ve spoken to others in platonic arrangements on here but we don\u2019t speak up because we\u2019re constantly called liars.\n\n*To clarify, platonic to me means truly just friendship and emotional connection, no kissing hand holding, dirty talk or even sexy pics.*\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re easy to find (as they almost always find me) but I\u2019ve spent a long time refining my profile and communication to attract this type of SD. More often then not it\u2019s actually an SD who is looking for a traditional arrangement but for one reason or another they really connected with my profile and decided it was worth getting to know me. When I ask them what specifically they connected with, most say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate and the most genuine profile I\u2019ve read on here\u201d or they specifically mention being impressed with my charitable work.\n\nI seriously have more meet up and arrangement requests than I have time to weed through so I\u2019m honestly shocked people keep saying it\u2019s impossible.\n\nSome factors I believe play a role in my success:\n- I\u2019m 30 but the appearance and physique of a 21 yr old\n- I have a very gentle, girl next door look (I don\u2019t post any sexy pics)\n- I\u2019m very educated and cultured\n- I live in two major cities including a large tourist town (lots of platonic PPM requests).\n- I\u2019m very caring and genuine in the relationships I pursue. I often give a lot more than I get.\n- Different needs I\u2019ve filled are tour guide, dance partner, dinner date, business mentor, unofficial therapist, dating coach, travel companion, quarantine buddy, and friend to talk religion/politics with.\n\nI rarely bring up allowance or gifts, it\u2019s always offered as a way they want to show their appreciation for my friendship and time (I\u2019m a single mom so they know I pay my sitter and miss work to see them). Just this week I checked on two friends (from SA) who I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a while and said I wanted to make sure they were doing well. After exchanging several messages they asked about my situation and pushed repeatedly for information regarding my finances and if they could help I\u2019m any way. I\u2019ve never met either of them because the pandemic started before we could meet but I make a point to check on them and care about their lives because I honestly care.\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s probably more factors I\u2019m missing but I hope that helps you and anyone else following to understand why gentlemen would seek out an arrangement without sex.",

This was a light-hearted post meant to to highlight the fact that these are relationships.  I was actually hoping to create a discussion about how different levels of care are ok within the lifestyle, and give a little brevity to a subreddit I used to enjoy. \n\nI am a sex-positive feminist and do not have negative feelings about sex-work. I think it is essential and honorable work. I do not think that hardened sex-workers should be giving advice to young girls. We have had a nasty boring  and sad week here. Sugaring is care work and is more about using your heart. That's  simply what I feel and how I do it. \n\nI am entitled to defend myself against a hard-heartened person trying to belittle my experience. I have met the most amazing men. They are, for the most part, looking for affection, attention, and care. Sex...yes, and \"marrying down\" not so much.\n\nIf I would like to express my opinion on how a relationship, outside of the perfect SB goal, which isn't usually marriage, just so that is clear, has been a positive. \n\nI should be allowed to do so without petty attacks or upset that I'm misinforming the young potential sex-workers or \"women who wish to marry up\" Sorry you don't like me anymore. That is what down-vote is for.  Good luck.",

The other reinforcement of this is most people just ignorantly repeat the narrative they\u2019ve heard others on here say. I\u2019ve spoken to others in platonic arrangements on here but we don\u2019t speak up because we\u2019re constantly called liars.\n\n*To clarify, platonic to me means truly just friendship and emotional connection, no kissing hand holding, dirty talk or even sexy pics.*\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re easy to find (as they almost always find me) but I\u2019ve spent a long time refining my profile and communication to attract this type of SD. More often then not it\u2019s actually an SD who is looking for a traditional arrangement but for one reason or another they really connected with my profile and decided it was worth getting to know me. When I ask them what specifically they connected with, most say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate and the most genuine profile I\u2019ve read on here\u201d or they specifically mention being impressed with my charitable work.\n\nI seriously have more meet up and arrangement requests than I have time to weed through so I\u2019m honestly shocked people keep saying it\u2019s impossible.\n\nSome factors I believe play a role in my success:\n- I\u2019m 30 but the appearance and physique of a 21 yr old\n- I have a very gentle, girl next door look (I don\u2019t post any sexy pics)\n- I\u2019m very educated and cultured\n- I live in two major cities including a large tourist town (lots of platonic PPM requests).\n- I\u2019m very caring and genuine in the relationships I pursue. I often give a lot more than I get.\n- Different needs I\u2019ve filled are tour guide, dance partner, dinner date, business mentor, unofficial therapist, dating coach, travel companion, quarantine buddy, and friend to talk religion/politics with.\n\nI rarely bring up allowance or gifts, it\u2019s always offered as a way they want to show their appreciation for my friendship and time (I\u2019m a single mom so they know I pay my sitter and miss work to see them). Just this week I checked on two friends (from SA) who I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a while and said I wanted to make sure they were doing well. After exchanging several messages they asked about my situation and pushed repeatedly for information regarding my finances and if they could help I\u2019m any way. I\u2019ve never met either of them because the pandemic started before we could meet but I make a point to check on them and care about their lives because I honestly care.\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s probably more factors I\u2019m missing but I hope that helps you and anyone else following to understand why gentlemen would seek out an arrangement without sex.",

The other reinforcement of this is most people just ignorantly repeat the narrative they\u2019ve heard others on here say. I\u2019ve spoken to others in platonic arrangements on here but we don\u2019t speak up because we\u2019re constantly called liars.\n\n*To clarify, platonic to me means truly just friendship and emotional connection, no kissing hand holding, dirty talk or even sexy pics.*\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re easy to find (as they almost always find me) but I\u2019ve spent a long time refining my profile and communication to attract this type of SD. More often then not it\u2019s actually an SD who is looking for a traditional arrangement but for one reason or another they really connected with my profile and decided it was worth getting to know me. When I ask them what specifically they connected with, most say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate and the most genuine profile I\u2019ve read on here\u201d or they specifically mention being impressed with my charitable work.\n\nI seriously have more meet up and arrangement requests than I have time to weed through so I\u2019m honestly shocked people keep saying it\u2019s impossible.\n\nSome factors I believe play a role in my success:\n- I\u2019m 30 but the appearance and physique of a 21 yr old\n- I have a very gentle, girl next door look (I don\u2019t post any sexy pics)\n- I\u2019m very educated and cultured\n- I live in two major cities including a large tourist town (lots of platonic PPM requests).\n- I\u2019m very caring and genuine in the relationships I pursue. I often give a lot more than I get.\n- Different needs I\u2019ve filled are tour guide, dance partner, dinner date, business mentor, unofficial therapist, dating coach, travel companion, quarantine buddy, and friend to talk religion/politics with.\n\nI rarely bring up allowance or gifts, it\u2019s always offered as a way they want to show their appreciation for my friendship and time (I\u2019m a single mom so they know I pay my sitter and miss work to see them). Just this week I checked on two friends (from SA) who I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a while and said I wanted to make sure they were doing well. After exchanging several messages they asked about my situation and pushed repeatedly for information regarding my finances and if they could help I\u2019m any way. I\u2019ve never met either of them because the pandemic started before we could meet but I make a point to check on them and care about their lives because I honestly care.\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s probably more factors I\u2019m missing but I hope that helps you and anyone else following to understand why gentlemen would seek out an arrangement without sex.",

The other reinforcement of this is most people just ignorantly repeat the narrative they\u2019ve heard others on here say. I\u2019ve spoken to others in platonic arrangements on here but we don\u2019t speak up because we\u2019re constantly called liars.\n\n*To clarify, platonic to me means truly just friendship and emotional connection, no kissing hand holding, dirty talk or even sexy pics.*\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re easy to find (as they almost always find me) but I\u2019ve spent a long time refining my profile and communication to attract this type of SD. More often then not it\u2019s actually an SD who is looking for a traditional arrangement but for one reason or another they really connected with my profile and decided it was worth getting to know me. When I ask them what specifically they connected with, most say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate and the most genuine profile I\u2019ve read on here\u201d or they specifically mention being impressed with my charitable work.\n\nI seriously have more meet up and arrangement requests than I have time to weed through so I\u2019m honestly shocked people keep saying it\u2019s impossible.\n\nSome factors I believe play a role in my success:\n- I\u2019m 30 but the appearance and physique of a 21 yr old\n- I have a very gentle, girl next door look (I don\u2019t post any sexy pics)\n- I\u2019m very educated and cultured\n- I live in two major cities including a large tourist town (lots of platonic PPM requests).\n- I\u2019m very caring and genuine in the relationships I pursue. I often give a lot more than I get.\n- Different needs I\u2019ve filled are tour guide, dance partner, dinner date, business mentor, unofficial therapist, dating coach, travel companion, quarantine buddy, and friend to talk religion/politics with.\n\nI rarely bring up allowance or gifts, it\u2019s always offered as a way they want to show their appreciation for my friendship and time (I\u2019m a single mom so they know I pay my sitter and miss work to see them). Just this week I checked on two friends (from SA) who I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a while and said I wanted to make sure they were doing well. After exchanging several messages they asked about my situation and pushed repeatedly for information regarding my finances and if they could help I\u2019m any way. I\u2019ve never met either of them because the pandemic started before we could meet but I make a point to check on them and care about their lives because I honestly care.\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s probably more factors I\u2019m missing but I hope that helps you and anyone else following to understand why gentlemen would seek out an arrangement without sex.",

This was a light-hearted post meant to to highlight the fact that these are relationships.  I was actually hoping to create a discussion about how different levels of care are ok within the lifestyle, and give a little brevity to a subreddit I used to enjoy. \n\nI am a sex-positive feminist and do not have negative feelings about sex-work. I think it is essential and honorable work. I do not think that hardened sex-workers should be giving advice to young girls. We have had a nasty boring  and sad week here. Sugaring is care work and is more about using your heart. That's  simply what I feel and how I do it. \n\nI am entitled to defend myself against a hard-heartened person trying to belittle my experience. I have met the most amazing men. They are, for the most part, looking for affection, attention, and care. Sex...yes, and \"marrying down\" not so much.\n\nIf I would like to express my opinion on how a relationship, outside of the perfect SB goal, which isn't usually marriage, just so that is clear, has been a positive. \n\nI should be allowed to do so without petty attacks or upset that I'm misinforming the young potential sex-workers or \"women who wish to marry up\" Sorry you don't like me anymore. That is what down-vote is for.  Good luck.",

The other reinforcement of this is most people just ignorantly repeat the narrative they\u2019ve heard others on here say. I\u2019ve spoken to others in platonic arrangements on here but we don\u2019t speak up because we\u2019re constantly called liars.\n\n*To clarify, platonic to me means truly just friendship and emotional connection, no kissing hand holding, dirty talk or even sexy pics.*\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re easy to find (as they almost always find me) but I\u2019ve spent a long time refining my profile and communication to attract this type of SD. More often then not it\u2019s actually an SD who is looking for a traditional arrangement but for one reason or another they really connected with my profile and decided it was worth getting to know me. When I ask them what specifically they connected with, most say something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate and the most genuine profile I\u2019ve read on here\u201d or they specifically mention being impressed with my charitable work.\n\nI seriously have more meet up and arrangement requests than I have time to weed through so I\u2019m honestly shocked people keep saying it\u2019s impossible.\n\nSome factors I believe play a role in my success:\n- I\u2019m 30 but the appearance and physique of a 21 yr old\n- I have a very gentle, girl next door look (I don\u2019t post any sexy pics)\n- I\u2019m very educated and cultured\n- I live in two major cities including a large tourist town (lots of platonic PPM requests).\n- I\u2019m very caring and genuine in the relationships I pursue. I often give a lot more than I get.\n- Different needs I\u2019ve filled are tour guide, dance partner, dinner date, business mentor, unofficial therapist, dating coach, travel companion, quarantine buddy, and friend to talk religion/politics with.\n\nI rarely bring up allowance or gifts, it\u2019s always offered as a way they want to show their appreciation for my friendship and time (I\u2019m a single mom so they know I pay my sitter and miss work to see them). Just this week I checked on two friends (from SA) who I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a while and said I wanted to make sure they were doing well. After exchanging several messages they asked about my situation and pushed repeatedly for information regarding my finances and if they could help I\u2019m any way. I\u2019ve never met either of them because the pandemic started before we could meet but I make a point to check on them and care about their lives because I honestly care.\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s probably more factors I\u2019m missing but I hope that helps you and anyone else following to understand why gentlemen would seek out an arrangement without sex.",
