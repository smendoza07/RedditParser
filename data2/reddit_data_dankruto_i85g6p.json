Kakashi only focused his attention on Sasuke because he understood him and didn't want him to turn out how he did. As well as that Sasuke was fighting Gaara who was the strongest Genin in the exams and would have killed Sasuke with no hesitation.\n\nKiller Bee and Naruto's life was nowhere near as bad as Sasuke's and honestly Kakashi and Gaara didn't have it as bad as Sasuke as well. \n\nSasuke, before becoming a shinobi, had his whole family slaughtered in one night by the person he looked up to most and then was forced to witness this personally during Itachi's mental torture. Sasuke was powerless and when he did obtain some deal of power he saw Itachi, was absolutely humiliated by him and tortured again and had to relive the same thing that traumatised him before.\n\nAdditionally, Sasuke was then truly isolated after the massacre and he lived on his own, with no support or anybody that loved him until he was put on Team 7.",

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

Itachi psychological tortured him at a young age to force sasuke to hate him, the kids been fucked up his whole life. Also if you remember he had the curse mark at this point in the series and that was definitely fucking with him to. Don't act like sasuke somehow had it better than those other dudes.",

Pretty much everything Sasuke did was justifiable from his perspective.\n\nAnd even if he was calling like 6 year old Sasuke a snowflake I don't think it makes sense. It's not Madara era where small children are fighting to the death and that's just the norm. The whole ideal of the village system was to give kids a longer childhood before they become ninja and fight to the death. Sasuke is just a regular kid who had a pretty good home life. That doesn't make him a snowflake",

And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks. You do realise I'm only trolling back right?

Kakashi only focused his attention on Sasuke because he understood him and didn't want him to turn out how he did. As well as that Sasuke was fighting Gaara who was the strongest Genin in the exams and would have killed Sasuke with no hesitation.\n\nKiller Bee and Naruto's life was nowhere near as bad as Sasuke's and honestly Kakashi and Gaara didn't have it as bad as Sasuke as well. \n\nSasuke, before becoming a shinobi, had his whole family slaughtered in one night by the person he looked up to most and then was forced to witness this personally during Itachi's mental torture. Sasuke was powerless and when he did obtain some deal of power he saw Itachi, was absolutely humiliated by him and tortured again and had to relive the same thing that traumatised him before.\n\nAdditionally, Sasuke was then truly isolated after the massacre and he lived on his own, with no support or anybody that loved him until he was put on Team 7.",

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

Itachi psychological tortured him at a young age to force sasuke to hate him, the kids been fucked up his whole life. Also if you remember he had the curse mark at this point in the series and that was definitely fucking with him to. Don't act like sasuke somehow had it better than those other dudes.",

It's not Madara era where small children are fighting to the death and that's just the norm. The whole ideal of the village system was to give kids a longer childhood before they become ninja and fight to the death. Sasuke is just a regular kid who had a pretty good home life.

And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

Nice trolling dude. Unfortunately I don't fall for childish tactics like yours. I don't need to make you like a contradicting fool, you do it yourself lol. You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks.

Actually, 99% of the Uchiha should.\n\nKakashi, Gaara, Naruto, Killer B, etc had it just as bad or worse and they adapted because that's what being a fighter is about.\n\nAt least, Part I Sasuke was fairly justified and well-handled. \n\nShippuden Sauske is a whole new breed of privileged piece of trash.",

Saying he lives in a different world is such a cop out reaponse, you're clearly meant to understand and empathise with Sasuke and how he feels, he literally had an on screen mental breakdown when he found out the truth about the massacre, telling someone to buck up just displays your blatant misunderstanding of his character.\n\nBased on the conversation Naruto and Sasuke had during and after their final fight its pretty clear that the Uchiha weren't well liked by the village and Sasuke was not lavished with attention neither before or after the massacre. Kakashi only focused his attention on Sasuke because he understood him and didn't want him to turn out how he did. As well as that Sasuke was fighting Gaara who was the strongest Genin in the exams and would have killed Sasuke with no hesitation.\n\nKiller Bee and Naruto's life was nowhere near as bad as Sasuke's and honestly Kakashi and Gaara didn't have it as bad as Sasuke as well. \n\nSasuke, before becoming a shinobi, had his whole family slaughtered in one night by the person he looked up to most and then was forced to witness this personally during Itachi's mental torture. Sasuke was powerless and when he did obtain some deal of power he saw Itachi, was absolutely humiliated by him and tortured again and had to relive the same thing that traumatised him before.\n\nAdditionally, Sasuke was then truly isolated after the massacre and he lived on his own, with no support or anybody that loved him until he was put on Team 7.",

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

Sasuke's background is just as tragic as naruto's, they literally have this conversation in the part one final fight. Naruto keeps saying he understands sasuke's pain and sasuke says that naruto can't understand what his pain is like because naruto didn't have a family to loose. Itachi psychological tortured him at a young age to force sasuke to hate him, the kids been fucked up his whole life. Also if you remember he had the curse mark at this point in the series and that was definitely fucking with him to. Don't act like sasuke somehow had it better than those other dudes.",

Pretty much everything Sasuke did was justifiable from his perspective.\n\nAnd even if he was calling like 6 year old Sasuke a snowflake I don't think it makes sense. It's not Madara era where small children are fighting to the death and that's just the norm. The whole ideal of the village system was to give kids a longer childhood before they become ninja and fight to the death. Sasuke is just a regular kid who had a pretty good home life. That doesn't make him a snowflake",

And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

Nice trolling dude. Unfortunately I don't fall for childish tactics like yours. I don't need to make you like a contradicting fool, you do it yourself lol. You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks. You do realise I'm only trolling back right? So do yourself a favour, don't bother replying and keep thinking the world revolves around you and nobody will realise you are a kid when you get so heated at being called one xD",

Kakashi only focused his attention on Sasuke because he understood him and didn't want him to turn out how he did. As well as that Sasuke was fighting Gaara who was the strongest Genin in the exams and would have killed Sasuke with no hesitation.\n\nKiller Bee and Naruto's life was nowhere near as bad as Sasuke's and honestly Kakashi and Gaara didn't have it as bad as Sasuke as well. \n\nSasuke, before becoming a shinobi, had his whole family slaughtered in one night by the person he looked up to most and then was forced to witness this personally during Itachi's mental torture. Sasuke was powerless and when he did obtain some deal of power he saw Itachi, was absolutely humiliated by him and tortured again and had to relive the same thing that traumatised him before.\n\nAdditionally, Sasuke was then truly isolated after the massacre and he lived on his own, with no support or anybody that loved him until he was put on Team 7.",

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

I didn\u2019t mean that he was just an all around prick but i feel like he could have developed the character more to have more than 3 emotions, anger, sadness and jealousy. and yes in most fights he was superior or having to be saved but isn\u2019t that the same with most other characters.... also i\u2019ve almost finished shippuden but not all the way through sorry !!",

Itachi psychological tortured him at a young age to force sasuke to hate him, the kids been fucked up his whole life. Also if you remember he had the curse mark at this point in the series and that was definitely fucking with him to. Don't act like sasuke somehow had it better than those other dudes.",

It's not Madara era where small children are fighting to the death and that's just the norm. The whole ideal of the village system was to give kids a longer childhood before they become ninja and fight to the death. Sasuke is just a regular kid who had a pretty good home life.

                                    "body": "Ok ok I get some of it but like sasuke was a brat and only wanted power in my opinion I think itachi could of did things a different way but he didn\u2019t but the reason why itachi is important is because he made a big sacrifice and we cannot act as if he was some kind of monster sasuke didn\u2019t know what was going on so he felt betrayed that his own brother did that to him but when he knew the whole story it was clear this itachi made a big sacrifice but sasuke then sasuke just says \u201clet me just destroy the hidden leaf village\u201d it wasn\u2019t exactly like that but it is how it was meant to say  that in that kind of way he said it .                                                                            And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

Nice trolling dude. Unfortunately I don't fall for childish tactics like yours. I don't need to make you like a contradicting fool, you do it yourself lol. You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks. You do realise I'm only trolling back right?

Kakashi only focused his attention on Sasuke because he understood him and didn't want him to turn out how he did. As well as that Sasuke was fighting Gaara who was the strongest Genin in the exams and would have killed Sasuke with no hesitation.\n\nKiller Bee and Naruto's life was nowhere near as bad as Sasuke's and honestly Kakashi and Gaara didn't have it as bad as Sasuke as well. \n\nSasuke, before becoming a shinobi, had his whole family slaughtered in one night by the person he looked up to most and then was forced to witness this personally during Itachi's mental torture. Sasuke was powerless and when he did obtain some deal of power he saw Itachi, was absolutely humiliated by him and tortured again and had to relive the same thing that traumatised him before.\n\nAdditionally, Sasuke was then truly isolated after the massacre and he lived on his own, with no support or anybody that loved him until he was put on Team 7.",

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

Pretty much everything Sasuke did was justifiable from his perspective.\n\nAnd even if he was calling like 6 year old Sasuke a snowflake I don't think it makes sense. It's not Madara era where small children are fighting to the death and that's just the norm. The whole ideal of the village system was to give kids a longer childhood before they become ninja and fight to the death. Sasuke is just a regular kid who had a pretty good home life. That doesn't make him a snowflake",

And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

Nice trolling dude. Unfortunately I don't fall for childish tactics like yours. I don't need to make you like a contradicting fool, you do it yourself lol. You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks. You do realise I'm only trolling back right?

Saying he lives in a different world is such a cop out reaponse, you're clearly meant to understand and empathise with Sasuke and how he feels, he literally had an on screen mental breakdown when he found out the truth about the massacre, telling someone to buck up just displays your blatant misunderstanding of his character.\n\nBased on the conversation Naruto and Sasuke had during and after their final fight its pretty clear that the Uchiha weren't well liked by the village and Sasuke was not lavished with attention neither before or after the massacre. Kakashi only focused his attention on Sasuke because he understood him and didn't want him to turn out how he did. As well as that Sasuke was fighting Gaara who was the strongest Genin in the exams and would have killed Sasuke with no hesitation.\n\nKiller Bee and Naruto's life was nowhere near as bad as Sasuke's and honestly Kakashi and Gaara didn't have it as bad as Sasuke as well. \n\nSasuke, before becoming a shinobi, had his whole family slaughtered in one night by the person he looked up to most and then was forced to witness this personally during Itachi's mental torture. Sasuke was powerless and when he did obtain some deal of power he saw Itachi, was absolutely humiliated by him and tortured again and had to relive the same thing that traumatised him before.\n\nAdditionally, Sasuke was then truly isolated after the massacre and he lived on his own, with no support or anybody that loved him until he was put on Team 7.",

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

Itachi psychological tortured him at a young age to force sasuke to hate him, the kids been fucked up his whole life. Also if you remember he had the curse mark at this point in the series and that was definitely fucking with him to. Don't act like sasuke somehow had it better than those other dudes.",

It's not Madara era where small children are fighting to the death and that's just the norm.

And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks.

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

            "body": "Ok ok I get some of it but like sasuke was a brat and only wanted power in my opinion I think itachi could of did things a different way but he didn\u2019t but the reason why itachi is important is because he made a big sacrifice and we cannot act as if he was some kind of monster sasuke didn\u2019t know what was going on so he felt betrayed that his own brother did that to him but when he knew the whole story it was clear this itachi made a big sacrifice but sasuke then sasuke just says \u201clet me just destroy the hidden leaf village\u201d it wasn\u2019t exactly like that but it is how it was meant to say  that in that kind of way he said it .                                                                            And secondly:    Sasuke had a really hard time I get it and ik no one at that time had that same understanding of how he felt at that time but let\u2019s be real sasuke could of made a lot of better choices he had so much chances to change and when I mean chances I\u2019m mean the kinds that Kakashi and Naruto have gave him And if your gonna tell me that no one not even one person knew how he felt then you obviously didn\u2019t see the episode were Kakashi told him that what he was doing was gonna lead to something bad you can explain that to me cuz sasuke had the choices and it\u2019s not only me that thinks this it\u2019s a lot of people ik that feel the same thing about it and I don\u2019t hate sasuke I\u2019m actually a fan as most can see from my profile pic but itachi is not all to blame he didn\u2019t have much of a choice but there was other ways he could of done things even itachi himself said it he said he could of just told sasuke so what I\u2019m saying is that as a sasuke fan and a Naruto fan I\u2019m not gonna lie and say sasuke didn\u2019t do some stupid things but I do get we\u2019re your coming from but sasuke did see his family and and Naruto didn\u2019t until he was 17 and it wasn\u2019t even long and Kakashi had the worst childhood but Kakashi didn\u2019t just push everyone away instead of that he learned from his past and used obito\u2019s words as a lesson for the people that didn\u2019t pass the test and those people that didn\u2019t pass learnt that a person that doesn\u2019t help or protect their comrades before rules a scum and that\u2019s why nature\u2019s the way he is now so that should show you that no matter how painful sasuke had it he had choices and chances to start again and change but he didn\u2019t until he finally understood why Naruto is the way he is and I get people have different feelings and opinions to it yeh I get it but Kakashi had it kinda harder plus your not gonna tell me sasuke knew his whole clan except from his mum dad aunt and uncle if there\u2019s more you tell me but bet you couldn\u2019t so yeh plus you didn\u2019t have to write that so shady to me it was just a opinion \ud83d\ude05 we all think of it differently but I kind of think sasuke could of did things differently but it\u2019s cool\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks.

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks. You do realise I'm only trolling back right?

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",

You even admitted you are arguing about a manga you never even read and you did not even think to say you watched the anime in retaliation xD \n\nHow hypocritical of you to start ranting like a little kid who had his toy taken away but calling ME a little kid sksks.

He's the only character in the Naruto franchise who didn't submit to the Talk No Bullshit until he was beaten and guilt-tripped asfkj. He had a worse life than Naruto, definitely, with all the times he got mind-fucked and his life kept getting turned upside down. But sure, call him snowflake because someone like you only knows to bring down a character to make your own favourite look better :0\n\n>Even though the one who damaged him the most and caused his clan's demise was not the system but another pair of snowflake Uchiha named Madara and Obito. Sasuke is so stupid, he doesn't know the other leaders are feudal lords not just the Kage.\n\nWhat kinda bullshit is that lol. I don't even know where to start. How about you read the manga first. The Uchihas were opressed and alienated, a genocide against an entire clan was masqueraded as \"precautionary measure\" just because they dared to think to retaliate. Itachi isn't a saint either, he thinks killing an entire clan, including every innocent child and even the older generations, was the best course of action. Granted, he was also a child but it was said he already had Hokage-level intelligence. The problem is that he left a traumatised child alone after destroying what little self-esteem he had left. Danzo was the one who ordered the Uchiha massacre, he got away with it because he's part of the system. If you dont have half a brain to understand that, why the hell are you trying to argue about a character you clearly don't like. Why don't you instead go praise the character you do like instead of trying to twist people's views like an immature child. I'm going to be honest...you really sound like you don't know what you are talking about xD\n\nSasuke's journey was very understandable but his character path of revenge is not relatable unlike Naruto's goal of needing to be acknowledged and wanting attention. That's why he's always misunderstood when in fact, his goals are very simple and purely selflessly driven most of times. He has always fought for the sake of another.\n\n-He wanted to avenge his clan so his goal is to kill Itachi\n\n-He finds out that it was actually Konoha which had ordered this massacre and shoved all the burden on Itachi so he wants to pay Konoha back for what they (higher-ups who allowed this decision and masqueraded it) did to his brother, entire clan and himself.\n\n-He wants to re-create the system so new victims like him don't exist anymore and genocides & facism are not justified.\n\nWhat's so snowflake about this life of mind-rape LMAO. If anything, he had his own path and he was self-sufficient unlike Naruto who was dependant on him. He was never an antagonist because his goals were never directly against the main character's. He was his own character. He always stood up for his own goals and always fought for them. But the show is callled Naruto so in the end, Sasuke gave in, beaten and tired, he believed Naruto would reform the system in a less extreme way than his revolution plan. Well, from Tsunade being Hokage to Kakashi to Naruto...nothing has changed bruh. \n\nSasuke doesn't exist in Boruto because his characterisation is way off there. He is a slave to the system too instead of actively fighting back against what took everything from him. The only reason plausible being that he has been too brain-washed, manipulated and guilt-tripped o_o\n\nPlease, it's so clear you are biased against Sasuke. But your own twisted and untrue \"observations\" and \"assumptions\" are not universal, they are not the law. Your points are going to get refuted. At first, I wouldn't have bothered because you clearly are too argumentative to realise the deeper meanings here, but I had some free time to waste lol.",
