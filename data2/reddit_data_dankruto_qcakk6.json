Imo a masterpiece is something like CSM, Evangelion, Fruits Basket, Parasyte the Maxim, Ping pong the animation.  A flawed masterpiece is something like AoT, Death Note, Code Geass, HxH, JJK(since its not done yet), JoJo's, Sonny Boy, Castlevania and devilman crybaby. Imo a flawed masterpiece is something that is so close to a 10/10. \n\nI also think a masterpiece is a work that makes you question life, and changes your view on life. It can also be a work in which you just can't find a flaw. A flawed masterpiece is something that does what a masterpiece does, but on a smaller level and its also less deep. You can really enjoy flawed masterpieces without losing quality of writing and impact. \n\nNaruto is high on impact, but imo it wasn't flawed masterpiece level for me. I really loved it, it was my first anime and it always has a special place in my heart. However I can't rank it with these gems of anime and in some cases story telling in general. \n\nI think naruto ranks just a level below a flawed masterpiece for me. Its very enjoyable, has good payoff in the end with naruto's journey, and has some strong suits. However a lot of fundamental flaws hold it back imo. Not utilizing the majority of the cast, world building is good but could have been expanded on more, power scaling just got ridonculous, and the message got very convoluted towards the end. \n\nObviously my classification of ranking is different from yours, but I think we kinda agree",

Imo a masterpiece is something like CSM, Evangelion, Fruits Basket, Parasyte the Maxim, Ping pong the animation.  A flawed masterpiece is something like AoT, Death Note, Code Geass, HxH, JJK(since its not done yet), JoJo's, Sonny Boy, Castlevania and devilman crybaby. Imo a flawed masterpiece is something that is so close to a 10/10. \n\nI also think a masterpiece is a work that makes you question life, and changes your view on life. It can also be a work in which you just can't find a flaw. A flawed masterpiece is something that does what a masterpiece does, but on a smaller level and its also less deep. You can really enjoy flawed masterpieces without losing quality of writing and impact. \n\nNaruto is high on impact, but imo it wasn't flawed masterpiece level for me. I really loved it, it was my first anime and it always has a special place in my heart. However I can't rank it with these gems of anime and in some cases story telling in general. \n\nI think naruto ranks just a level below a flawed masterpiece for me. Its very enjoyable, has good payoff in the end with naruto's journey, and has some strong suits. However a lot of fundamental flaws hold it back imo. Not utilizing the majority of the cast, world building is good but could have been expanded on more, power scaling just got ridonculous, and the message got very convoluted towards the end. \n\nObviously my classification of ranking is different from yours, but I think we kinda agree",

Imo a masterpiece is something like CSM, Evangelion, Fruits Basket, Parasyte the Maxim, Ping pong the animation.  A flawed masterpiece is something like AoT, Death Note, Code Geass, HxH, JJK(since its not done yet), JoJo's, Sonny Boy, Castlevania and devilman crybaby. Imo a flawed masterpiece is something that is so close to a 10/10. \n\nI also think a masterpiece is a work that makes you question life, and changes your view on life. It can also be a work in which you just can't find a flaw. A flawed masterpiece is something that does what a masterpiece does, but on a smaller level and its also less deep. You can really enjoy flawed masterpieces without losing quality of writing and impact. \n\nNaruto is high on impact, but imo it wasn't flawed masterpiece level for me. I really loved it, it was my first anime and it always has a special place in my heart. However I can't rank it with these gems of anime and in some cases story telling in general. \n\nI think naruto ranks just a level below a flawed masterpiece for me. Its very enjoyable, has good payoff in the end with naruto's journey, and has some strong suits. However a lot of fundamental flaws hold it back imo. Not utilizing the majority of the cast, world building is good but could have been expanded on more, power scaling just got ridonculous, and the message got very convoluted towards the end. \n\nObviously my classification of ranking is different from yours, but I think we kinda agree",
