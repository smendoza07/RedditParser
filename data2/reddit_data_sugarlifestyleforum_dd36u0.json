    "body": "So I originally joined the bowl about 6 years ago when I was 18. I joined on Carat Dating (if anyone else remembers that insane site) and was kind of on and off of it because I always felt so embarrassed and insecure being seen on dates with older men and couldn\u2019t ever imagine having to be intimate with any of them\n\nNow flash forward, I\u2019m 24 and have been in 3 very successful, intimate sugar relationships with men in their 40\u2019s-50\u2019s.\n\nSo I recently decided to go back to school and one of my professors is an average looking man in probably his late 50\u2019s, but unbelievably intelligent, and always looks so handsome in his suits. Tell me why I have the biggest crush (and sometimes wild fantasies) about my English professor when I\u2019m surrounded by guys my age!!\n\nThe sugar bowl has ruined me for good \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude08",
