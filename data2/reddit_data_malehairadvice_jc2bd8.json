My hair is 100% straight, so sadly no tips for curly hair, sorry!\n\n\nAs a quick sidenote, if you have oily hair, shampoo 1+ times a day.

This minimises breakage, and makes sure the curls will last if theres less knots. \n\nYou will notice a ton of hair in the shower, but the average human loses >100 hair per day, its just for curly people the fallen hair just gets trapped and is only released in the shower\n\nStraight hair you can get away with anything, but curly hair needs special care",

Don't let it knot up, not only is it painful as hell to untangle (there's sprays to help), but it looks less than stellar.\n\nIf your hair is *super* frizzy from static and whatnot, dryer sheets supposedly work, but I rarely ever have issues like that. \n\nThe simple rule (imo) is: make it look like you at least *know* what a brush is. My hair is 100% straight, so sadly no tips for curly hair, sorry!\n\n\nAs a quick sidenote, if you have oily hair, shampoo 1+ times a day. Some people can get away with 2-3 days and look fine, but after a single night I look like I rub chicken fat in my hair.",

It will ruin curl locks and any texture, it will promote frizz, and it will cause breakage and split ends\n\nThe only time to detangle is in the shower, and that is _only_ when your hair is dripping in conditioner, and with a very wide tooth comb (or fingers), with very gentle motions. This minimises breakage, and makes sure the curls will last if theres less knots. \n\nYou will notice a ton of hair in the shower, but the average human loses >100 hair per day, its just for curly people the fallen hair just gets trapped and is only released in the shower\n\nStraight hair you can get away with anything, but curly hair needs special care",
