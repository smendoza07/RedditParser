Gaara's only other confirmed kill during those exams is Dosu of the Sound who is of canonically undetermined age but implied to be older than Zaku and Kin Tsuchi, nominally leading the Sound trio and generally has certain speech mannerisms in both English and Japanese that indicate a 18-22 age range, which would be about right logically speaking, considering their mission. Might just be the VA selections informing that, but he has no canon age. Finally, the two blackmailing dudes at the exam final were adults as well.\n\nBottom line - 6 kills, only 3 were murder, 1 was a damn teamkill brought on by the mummy man literally challenging him to a fight to the death, and the last 2, if Gaara were stable at the time, likely would have happened anyway out of self-defense because those blackmailers were stupid and likely would have attempted to kill Gaara to enforce a *de facto* match forfeit.\n\nConsidering Gaara's arcs before and after this point, it is highly likely that he didn't perform any unsanctionable kills after Naruto pulled the talk no jutsu, and the terror of pre-exam Gaara was mostly confined to Sand shinobi assassins while Shukaku was asleep.\n\nFormer escaped-from-the-loony-bin edgelord or not, Gaara still manages to win the moral high ground by a landslide here.",

Had the Kazekage not literally been murdered and had it not been revealed to what insane extent the Sand had been manipulated, the trio of Leaf leadership left at the time would undoubtably have formally declared war on the Sand and marched on the Land of Wind.",

Gaara's only other confirmed kill during those exams is Dosu of the Sound who is of canonically undetermined age but implied to be older than Zaku and Kin Tsuchi, nominally leading the Sound trio and generally has certain speech mannerisms in both English and Japanese that indicate a 18-22 age range, which would be about right logically speaking, considering their mission. Might just be the VA selections informing that, but he has no canon age. Finally, the two blackmailing dudes at the exam final were adults as well.\n\nBottom line - 6 kills, only 3 were murder, 1 was a damn teamkill brought on by the mummy man literally challenging him to a fight to the death, and the last 2, if Gaara were stable at the time, likely would have happened anyway out of self-defense because those blackmailers were stupid and likely would have attempted to kill Gaara to enforce a *de facto* match forfeit.\n\nConsidering Gaara's arcs before and after this point, it is highly likely that he didn't perform any unsanctionable kills after Naruto pulled the talk no jutsu, and the terror of pre-exam Gaara was mostly confined to Sand shinobi assassins while Shukaku was asleep.\n\nFormer escaped-from-the-loony-bin edgelord or not, Gaara still manages to win the moral high ground by a landslide here.",
