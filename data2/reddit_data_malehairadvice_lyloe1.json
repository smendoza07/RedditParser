                            "body": "Then give it cut I say. You are still able to do a lot of volume on top with short back and sides, so take advantage of it. Maybe even go clean shaven, at least to be reminded what you look like under there. It seems like you have a facial hair type that can be very thick when cut very closely, like that ultra 5 o'clock shadow that you seen in fashion magazines and ads and shit. I would go for that and maybe bring the stache and goat back a bit. I never got the gift of halfway decent facial hair so I don't know how easy all of that is to attain. However, I do know that you've probably got til at least your early 30s to get your hair long again without it being noticeably thin or graying so a few years off from the hassle I think is probably worth it. Plus big drastic changes does get the babes to notice big time. I remember if friends of mine cut off their beards and long hair even the ones who weren't very attractive, girls (and a few guys) told me how seriously good looking they were. Everyone had only known them with the beard and long hair so it was like opening up a present you'd seen sitting under the christmas tree for a long time. Or like a new cute guy had moved in to town. \n\nMost of us are at the peak of our attractiveness at 25 so save the beard for when you are 50 and don't give a fuck. Only thing I would say is if you do volume on top you will have to find a decent product. Your hair looks like it is simultaneously very fine but somehow also very thick. It's also mostly straight with a bit of a wave to it, which means it will take the right product very well. I bet getting out of bed two days after washing it is what you want it to look like (when it is short that is). I don't have hair like this so I don't know what that product is specifically. Probably best to go to a stylist with some pictures on your phone; someone who is at least a little bit fancy. But yeah do a big change and show everyone how hot you are!",

Maybe even go clean shaven, at least to be reminded what you look like under there. It seems like you have a facial hair type that can be very thick when cut very closely, like that ultra 5 o'clock shadow that you seen in fashion magazines and ads and shit. I would go for that and maybe bring the stache and goat back a bit. I never got the gift of halfway decent facial hair so I don't know how easy all of that is to attain. However, I do know that you've probably got til at least your early 30s to get your hair long again without it being noticeably thin or graying so a few years off from the hassle I think is probably worth it. Plus big drastic changes does get the babes to notice big time. I remember if friends of mine cut off their beards and long hair even the ones who weren't very attractive, girls (and a few guys) told me how seriously good looking they were. Everyone had only known them with the beard and long hair so it was like opening up a present you'd seen sitting under the christmas tree for a long time. Or like a new cute guy had moved in to town. \n\nMost of us are at the peak of our attractiveness at 25 so save the beard for when you are 50 and don't give a fuck. Only thing I would say is if you do volume on top you will have to find a decent product. Your hair looks like it is simultaneously very fine but somehow also very thick. It's also mostly straight with a bit of a wave to it, which means it will take the right product very well. I bet getting out of bed two days after washing it is what you want it to look like (when it is short that is). I don't have hair like this so I don't know what that product is specifically. Probably best to go to a stylist with some pictures on your phone; someone who is at least a little bit fancy. But yeah do a big change and show everyone how hot you are!",
