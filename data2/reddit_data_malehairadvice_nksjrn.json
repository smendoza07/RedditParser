            "body": "Okay so first, your hair looks fucking awesome, don't cut it. Second, I'd like to give some constructive advice anyway.\n\n1. For God's sake keep it long. It looks better from the front than the back though - a barber may be able to cut some bulk out of the back, but don't let them touch the length- it's perfect. If that's how your hair falls naturally, without a ton of product or whatever, you are in luck.\n\n1. I'd be interested to see what you look like with a longer viking beard. Not saying necessarily better, but something to try.\n\n1. To take your gorgeous hair to the next level, stop washing with shampoo basically entirely. You can still wash with water or conditioner, and maybe shampoo once in a long while. Follow the [curly girl method](https://i.redd.it/ug97w7q0i5v11.png) for ringlets instead of frizz.\n\n1. The weakest part of these photos is the shirt. it's not bad, but it's wrinkly, the collar is floppy, etc. With a bold look like yours, you want every part of you to say \"I'm doing this on purpose\". Getting some tighter fitting shirts may help with the misgendering issue, or steer into a baggy grungy look, and wear some beautiful flannels. Check stores like Urban outfitters.\n\n1. As for collared shirt care, minimize the need to wash by wearing undershirts, button them completely when washing, wash them on cold to preserve the color, don't put them in the dryer (at all), just put them on a plastic hanger (not wire, to better distribute the weight), make sure it's still buttoned, get the collar and everything else exactly how you want it when wet, hang them to dry. No ironing necessary, like, ever.\n\n1. Finally, and this is crucial - developing a flawless fake Irish accent will double or triple your luck with the ladies.",
