Minato and Kushina may have lived, and Naruto would have had a family.  Naruto wouldn't have received Kurama.\n\nNot sure the Uchiha would have had a different fate though.",

There were other uzimakis at the time, Kushina and Karin atleast, so Madera wouldn't have been stopped. Yes Naruto's family would be alive, and that's some powerful people, but them being alive might not have effected the plan in the short term. \n\nObito could have attacked the jinchuri still, and with his powers, could have easily killed kushina some other time. In the end it was naruto who saved everyone with kurama. But nothing says his role couldn't have been filled with his mother. Maybe kurama watching her become a mother made him feel the same was as watching naruto grow up. \n\nAs for the uchiha, kurama attacking was the trigger for the massacre. So unless minato could bring them together, seems like they would be headed to civil war. I don't think the fourth would have ordered the extermination like the third did.",

(Okay, Might Guy is a beast)  Kurama hadn't ever worked with another Shinobu before, and Kushina very much seemed to treat him as a duty, rather than a friend.  Fortunately, not a curse like everyone treated it with Naruto.\n\nI don't think it was watching Naruto grow that changed Kurama.  I'd argue it was Naruto himself.  His constant positivity, and being the first to say, \"I'm coming after all that hatred inside you someday\".  Son Goku (gotta love his name) even said that Kurama had never worked with a Shinobu before.  It was Naruto who changed him, because he was the first to treat him as anything more than something to be contained.  Her entire clan was purposed to seal away the Tailed Beasts, not treat them as friends.\n\nObito may have been able to kill Kushina, yeah.  But, I'd argue that Jiraiya would have been able to stop him, or at least back Minato up when fighting him.  He took on multiple Pains at once, and I don't think Obito was at the height of his power when he attacked the Leaf.  As evidenced by his fight with Minato, and the beautiful Rasengan he took.\n\nI agree about the Uchiha.  I think they would have headed in the same direction regardless.  Unfortunate...  I'd love to have seen some potential time with Itachi and Sasuke being amazingly powerful together.  But, without the Uchiha tragedy, Sasuke wouldn't have reached the height of his power.\n\nI suppose it's all just guess-work though.\n\nThanks for the thought-out responses, dude",

Suggesting that Minato, Jiraiya, and Kushina all survived, and had a family, then i think we can view it as the infinite tsunami version of Naruto and Sasuke. They would both be strong ninjas but obviously not as strong as their other selves with Kurama and Mangekyou sharingan.  If i were to write it I would receive Madara the same way but have Kushina do some crazy sealing jutsu with kurama to bring back Hashirama from the dead. With a fully revived Madera and Hashirama, the main battle would be them. Madara seals the 10 tails in himself, while the sage of six paths gives his powers to Hashirama. They battle and become friends by both dying, leaving the next generation with a lesson learned. or something. \n\nI also like the idea of guy going all eight gates, almost defeating madera, then turning around to show he took off his leg weights and just unlocked the Ninth Gate: Ethereal Springtime Youth!",

There were other uzimakis at the time, Kushina and Karin atleast, so Madera wouldn't have been stopped. Yes Naruto's family would be alive, and that's some powerful people, but them being alive might not have effected the plan in the short term. \n\nObito could have attacked the jinchuri still, and with his powers, could have easily killed kushina some other time. In the end it was naruto who saved everyone with kurama. But nothing says his role couldn't have been filled with his mother. Maybe kurama watching her become a mother made him feel the same was as watching naruto grow up. \n\nAs for the uchiha, kurama attacking was the trigger for the massacre. So unless minato could bring them together, seems like they would be headed to civil war. I don't think the fourth would have ordered the extermination like the third did.",

(Okay, Might Guy is a beast)  Kurama hadn't ever worked with another Shinobu before, and Kushina very much seemed to treat him as a duty, rather than a friend.  Fortunately, not a curse like everyone treated it with Naruto.\n\nI don't think it was watching Naruto grow that changed Kurama.  I'd argue it was Naruto himself.  His constant positivity, and being the first to say, \"I'm coming after all that hatred inside you someday\".  Son Goku (gotta love his name) even said that Kurama had never worked with a Shinobu before.  It was Naruto who changed him, because he was the first to treat him as anything more than something to be contained.  Her entire clan was purposed to seal away the Tailed Beasts, not treat them as friends.\n\nObito may have been able to kill Kushina, yeah.  But, I'd argue that Jiraiya would have been able to stop him, or at least back Minato up when fighting him.  He took on multiple Pains at once, and I don't think Obito was at the height of his power when he attacked the Leaf.  As evidenced by his fight with Minato, and the beautiful Rasengan he took.\n\nI agree about the Uchiha.  I think they would have headed in the same direction regardless.  Unfortunate...  I'd love to have seen some potential time with Itachi and Sasuke being amazingly powerful together.  But, without the Uchiha tragedy, Sasuke wouldn't have reached the height of his power.\n\nI suppose it's all just guess-work though.\n\nThanks for the thought-out responses, dude",

Suggesting that Minato, Jiraiya, and Kushina all survived, and had a family, then i think we can view it as the infinite tsunami version of Naruto and Sasuke. They would both be strong ninjas but obviously not as strong as their other selves with Kurama and Mangekyou sharingan.  If i were to write it I would receive Madara the same way but have Kushina do some crazy sealing jutsu with kurama to bring back Hashirama from the dead. With a fully revived Madera and Hashirama, the main battle would be them. Madara seals the 10 tails in himself, while the sage of six paths gives his powers to Hashirama. They battle and become friends by both dying, leaving the next generation with a lesson learned. or something. \n\nI also like the idea of guy going all eight gates, almost defeating madera, then turning around to show he took off his leg weights and just unlocked the Ninth Gate: Ethereal Springtime Youth!",

In the end it was naruto who saved everyone with kurama. But nothing says his role couldn't have been filled with his mother. Maybe kurama watching her become a mother made him feel the same was as watching naruto grow up. \n\nAs for the uchiha, kurama attacking was the trigger for the massacre. So unless minato could bring them together, seems like they would be headed to civil war. I don't think the fourth would have ordered the extermination like the third did.",

                    "body": "Who would have beaten Madara at the end though?  It took the combined power of Sasuke and Naruto to win, and Naruto wouldn't have had those powers.  (Okay, Might Guy is a beast)  Kurama hadn't ever worked with another Shinobu before, and Kushina very much seemed to treat him as a duty, rather than a friend.  Fortunately, not a curse like everyone treated it with Naruto.\n\nI don't think it was watching Naruto grow that changed Kurama.  I'd argue it was Naruto himself.  His constant positivity, and being the first to say, \"I'm coming after all that hatred inside you someday\".  Son Goku (gotta love his name) even said that Kurama had never worked with a Shinobu before.  It was Naruto who changed him, because he was the first to treat him as anything more than something to be contained.  Her entire clan was purposed to seal away the Tailed Beasts, not treat them as friends.\n\nObito may have been able to kill Kushina, yeah.  But, I'd argue that Jiraiya would have been able to stop him, or at least back Minato up when fighting him.  He took on multiple Pains at once, and I don't think Obito was at the height of his power when he attacked the Leaf.  As evidenced by his fight with Minato, and the beautiful Rasengan he took.\n\nI agree about the Uchiha.  I think they would have headed in the same direction regardless.  Unfortunate...  I'd love to have seen some potential time with Itachi and Sasuke being amazingly powerful together.  But, without the Uchiha tragedy, Sasuke wouldn't have reached the height of his power.\n\nI suppose it's all just guess-work though.\n\nThanks for the thought-out responses, dude",

Suggesting that Minato, Jiraiya, and Kushina all survived, and had a family, then i think we can view it as the infinite tsunami version of Naruto and Sasuke. They would both be strong ninjas but obviously not as strong as their other selves with Kurama and Mangekyou sharingan.  If i were to write it I would receive Madara the same way but have Kushina do some crazy sealing jutsu with kurama to bring back Hashirama from the dead. With a fully revived Madera and Hashirama, the main battle would be them. Madara seals the 10 tails in himself, while the sage of six paths gives his powers to Hashirama. They battle and become friends by both dying, leaving the next generation with a lesson learned. or something. \n\nI also like the idea of guy going all eight gates, almost defeating madera, then turning around to show he took off his leg weights and just unlocked the Ninth Gate: Ethereal Springtime Youth!",

(Okay, Might Guy is a beast)  Kurama hadn't ever worked with another Shinobu before, and Kushina very much seemed to treat him as a duty, rather than a friend.  Fortunately, not a curse like everyone treated it with Naruto.\n\nI don't think it was watching Naruto grow that changed Kurama.  I'd argue it was Naruto himself.  His constant positivity, and being the first to say, \"I'm coming after all that hatred inside you someday\".  Son Goku (gotta love his name) even said that Kurama had never worked with a Shinobu before.  It was Naruto who changed him, because he was the first to treat him as anything more than something to be contained.  Her entire clan was purposed to seal away the Tailed Beasts, not treat them as friends.\n\nObito may have been able to kill Kushina, yeah.  But, I'd argue that Jiraiya would have been able to stop him, or at least back Minato up when fighting him.  He took on multiple Pains at once, and I don't think Obito was at the height of his power when he attacked the Leaf.  As evidenced by his fight with Minato, and the beautiful Rasengan he took.\n\nI agree about the Uchiha.  I think they would have headed in the same direction regardless.  Unfortunate...  I'd love to have seen some potential time with Itachi and Sasuke being amazingly powerful together.  But, without the Uchiha tragedy, Sasuke wouldn't have reached the height of his power.\n\nI suppose it's all just guess-work though.\n\nThanks for the thought-out responses, dude",

Suggesting that Minato, Jiraiya, and Kushina all survived, and had a family, then i think we can view it as the infinite tsunami version of Naruto and Sasuke. They would both be strong ninjas but obviously not as strong as their other selves with Kurama and Mangekyou sharingan.  If i were to write it I would receive Madara the same way but have Kushina do some crazy sealing jutsu with kurama to bring back Hashirama from the dead. With a fully revived Madera and Hashirama, the main battle would be them. Madara seals the 10 tails in himself, while the sage of six paths gives his powers to Hashirama. They battle and become friends by both dying, leaving the next generation with a lesson learned. or something. \n\nI also like the idea of guy going all eight gates, almost defeating madera, then turning around to show he took off his leg weights and just unlocked the Ninth Gate: Ethereal Springtime Youth!",

Suggesting that Minato, Jiraiya, and Kushina all survived, and had a family, then i think we can view it as the infinite tsunami version of Naruto and Sasuke. They would both be strong ninjas but obviously not as strong as their other selves with Kurama and Mangekyou sharingan.  If i were to write it I would receive Madara the same way but have Kushina do some crazy sealing jutsu with kurama to bring back Hashirama from the dead. With a fully revived Madera and Hashirama, the main battle would be them. Madara seals the 10 tails in himself, while the sage of six paths gives his powers to Hashirama. They battle and become friends by both dying, leaving the next generation with a lesson learned. or something. \n\nI also like the idea of guy going all eight gates, almost defeating madera, then turning around to show he took off his leg weights and just unlocked the Ninth Gate: Ethereal Springtime Youth!",
