Yes even the ones with VERY high potential. Either they treat SA or these other sugar sites like it\u2019s tinder/bumble to find their next girlfriend or they think they can get away with saying basically anything to you. I\u2019ve had enough, literally. From now on I\u2019m sticking with my 40+ rule. (The older the better)",

Took me to the pub to watch baseball (my fave activity), ate good pub food, drank craft beer and then would fuck me silly in the boardroom. He was handsome and charming but I think his luck in the bowl was low because *he wasn't white*. I genuinely miss him. Ladies, stop discounting south Asian men, and Asian men in general, they're some of the best lovers and so generous if you give them a chance. And that myth about their bottom half couldn't be farther from the truth. A lot of the younger SDs aren't white and I think they get an unfair deal.\n\nScratch everything i just said, im headed back to the bowl and don't want the competition, I'll take all those handsome men for myself",

Ability to give MORE money when you're older definitely plays a huge role in why an older SD seems more generous.\n\nwhat i can say is, certain cultures value giving more than other cultures.  white people in america and most of europe are highly selfish cultures.  think about family style meals vs. individualized portions being a good indicator. so i think dating certain cultures and finding SDs from cultures that are more generous might be a good idea for all",

He was raised Jewish in Bexley, Ohio but his parents were raised in Manhattan, NY. He was quite short but had a beautiful face. He was super respectful in front of his friends but alone with me? He was very cheap & super perverted. 80% of our conversations were of him asking me about his penis, his penis size, if I could make him c*** quickly again, if I wanted to see a picture before school, if I could take a picture with his penis, etc. I was very attracted to him physically but he was 36 & acting like he was 16.",

There's also the aspect of not wanting to be emotionally tied to anyone so that you can focus on your primary objective...make money. Work involved almost weekly travel, making relationships hard.  So sugar dating allowed for very easy upfront understandings of expectations without feelings getting in the way.  i also traveled to multiple cities often, so i'd pretty much have a SB in each frequently traveled city.  \n\non a more personal note, i'm an asian male who's short. If you read anything online about online dating for asian males, we have the roughest time in online dating for any male. you add short to that and you're in for a tough time. \n\nSo for someone with no time, issues with online dating (less issues when meeting in person), a pool of money that can't be spent because you're always working, i'd direct this back to you...why wouldn't i sugar date?",

You can sugar date with a minimum half a million liquid(alot of SDshave less) and low to mid six figure salary(assuming no kids). In order to casually vanilla date gorgeous girls,you need to be making a million annually,and have about a minimum 5 million in the bank/liquid in most major cities. The majority of SDs young or old probably dont have that. You need to enough money where she can live the millionaire lifestyle,without having her having to work. Even if you are offering marriage or LTR,you still need to make probably closer to half a million a year\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGirls who are Instagram hott have alot of options from pretty people jobs that pay well(high end bar waitress/hostess/PR marketing gigs corporate assistant) plus they can date long terms guys who make low to just below six figures who are age-appropriate but will pay for all the extra curriculars like drinks dinner and partying. They would rather do a combination of these two things than hang out with a 30 plus with a couple of million in the bank.",

If you read anything online about online dating for asian males, we have the roughest time in online dating for any male. you add short to that and you're in for a tough time. \n\nSo for someone with no time, issues with online dating (less issues when meeting in person), a pool of money that can't be spent because you're always working, i'd direct this back to you...why wouldn't i sugar date?",

There's also the aspect of not wanting to be emotionally tied to anyone so that you can focus on your primary objective...make money. Work involved almost weekly travel, making relationships hard.

If you read anything online about online dating for asian males, we have the roughest time in online dating for any male. you add short to that and you're in for a tough time. \n\nSo for someone with no time, issues with online dating (less issues when meeting in person), a pool of money that can't be spent because you're always working, i'd direct this back to you...why wouldn't i sugar date?",

If you read anything online about online dating for asian males, we have the roughest time in online dating for any male. you add short to that and you're in for a tough time. \n\nSo for someone with no time, issues with online dating (less issues when meeting in person), a pool of money that can't be spent because you're always working, i'd direct this back to you...why wouldn't i sugar date?",

In order to casually vanilla date gorgeous girls,you need to be making a million annually,and have about a minimum 5 million in the bank/liquid in most major cities. The majority of SDs young or old probably dont have that. You need to enough money where she can live the millionaire lifestyle,without having her having to work. Even if you are offering marriage or LTR,you still need to make probably closer to half a million a year\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGirls who are Instagram hott have alot of options from pretty people jobs that pay well(high end bar waitress/hostess/PR marketing gigs corporate assistant) plus they can date long terms guys who make low to just below six figures who are age-appropriate but will pay for all the extra curriculars like drinks dinner and partying. They would rather do a combination of these two things than hang out with a 30 plus with a couple of million in the bank.",
