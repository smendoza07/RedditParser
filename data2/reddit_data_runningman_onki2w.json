Viewer count and ratings from OTT media like Netflix, wavve, viu, Viki etc. are more valuable in determining the popularity of a show and portray a more accurate indicator of the actual popularity of a show instead of the limited group Nielsen and TNmS employ.\n\nThe 20-49 age group predominantly use smartphones or PCs to watch VODs online, and seldom watch TV if not never, like myself, and these age group is very lucrative for companies looking to sell their products or services, so this is actively targeted by advertising companies.\n\nI haven't heard of Gallup doing surveys on TV shows but it looks they do and are active if the PD actually singled them out, or I never actually paid attention on Gallup polls, I mostly associate them for their political surveys. \n\nBut yeah the focus on TV ratings on this subreddit and other Korean media reddits are a bit skewed and misplaced.",
