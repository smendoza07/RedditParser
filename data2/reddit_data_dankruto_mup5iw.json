I just like her more than boruto and it'd be interesting to see a story with a female lead. And with the direction they're going, it's gonna be more about kawaki and boruto, while sarada is gonna get short end of the stick.",

Kobuto has the unique ability of using medical jitsu to harm people and perform surgery to a degree I don't think others can making him already pretty unique and probably stronger than tsunade just as a base line. He is also highly intelligent and intuitive. He can also like just ressurect and dominate an entire army or armies of shenobi. Hell there is no reason, with the correct materials, he couldn't res the sage, his mom, or his brother. Pain and itachi we're not immune to kobutos res and mind control, so the sage of 6 and relatives should be no different imo.\n\nSo yeah kobuto is pretty op.

Kobuto has the unique ability of using medical jitsu to harm people and perform surgery to a degree I don't think others can making him already pretty unique and probably stronger than tsunade just as a base line. He is also highly intelligent and intuitive. He can also like just ressurect and dominate an entire army or armies of shenobi. Hell there is no reason, with the correct materials, he couldn't res the sage, his mom, or his brother.

He is also highly intelligent and intuitive. He can also like just ressurect and dominate an entire army or armies of shenobi.

Kobuto has the unique ability of using medical jitsu to harm people and perform surgery to a degree I don't think others can making him already pretty unique and probably stronger than tsunade just as a base line. He is also highly intelligent and intuitive. He can also like just ressurect and dominate an entire army or armies of shenobi. Hell there is no reason, with the correct materials, he couldn't res the sage, his mom, or his brother. Pain and itachi we're not immune to kobutos res and mind control, so the sage of 6 and relatives should be no different imo.\n\nSo yeah kobuto is pretty op.

There is no way without snake pedos research and black zetsu\u2019s help he would have accomplished any of the war arc nonsense.\n  \n\nAlso I think you need a pretty strong sharingan to control the tailed beasts we have only seen 3 people do this and they all were op asf.
