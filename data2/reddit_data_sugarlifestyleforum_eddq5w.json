    "body": "Sugar dating is transactional romance. Those terms are amply displayed on the box. So do not expect more from her. Take care of her to the max you are willing to invest. Keep her happy. Enjoy the relaxation she affords. Marvel at how accessible this form of relaxation has become. And when it is time. Move on. If she devolves into wanting more. And you have felt so inclined. The gods have blessed you. But beyond that. Keep a rein on your feelings and make sure you remain rich to play another day.",

Like the ones that cover up what their kids did and still visit and defend their, like, mass murderer or serial killer children. And honestly, it's not anything I think anyone should aspire to. They genuinely seem trapped and demented by it.\n\nAny love that you \"fall in\", by definition, had *specific* things that induced it--- that could hypothetically disappear or be outweighed by negative additions at any time. Some people think that's fucked up, but honestly I prefer that people's true loves are their values and their beliefs about life. There's really no virtue in unconditional love, in my opinion. People who romanticize it are generally thinking about themselves and how nice it would be to not analyze their actions in the context of how it will make other people feel/think. It's a kind of selfish and immature wish, in my experience.",

The fact that women no longer need men to survive and the fact that men are no longer needed for wars involving brawn. But to drive capitalism as the risk takers they are. Will mean that the genders will increasingly mediate love and sex through economics in a more honest way. Women will adapt better. Men on the other hand will take longer to be more detached. Emotionally. But we will. Both genders. Eventually align. Sugar dating will take this world by storm and eventually become the norm with the male elite dominating. It is early days though.",

            "body": "Agreed. The closest I've ever felt to \"unconditional\" love is for my sister, and I'd even cut ties with her if she did something particularly horrendous (talking like war crimes or serial killer here).\n\nI watch a lot of true crime actually, and it's the only place I've ever seen TRUE unconditional love, and it's from some parents to their children. Like the ones that cover up what their kids did and still visit and defend their, like, mass murderer or serial killer children. And honestly, it's not anything I think anyone should aspire to. They genuinely seem trapped and demented by it.\n\nAny love that you \"fall in\", by definition, had *specific* things that induced it--- that could hypothetically disappear or be outweighed by negative additions at any time. Some people think that's fucked up, but honestly I prefer that people's true loves are their values and their beliefs about life. There's really no virtue in unconditional love, in my opinion. People who romanticize it are generally thinking about themselves and how nice it would be to not analyze their actions in the context of how it will make other people feel/think. It's a kind of selfish and immature wish, in my experience.",
