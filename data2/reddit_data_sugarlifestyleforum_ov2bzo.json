    "body": "I was reading a recent SLF post about a M&G with someone who gave away through use of the word \"client\" that she was a sex worker. I would copy it here, but such wizardry is beyond me.\n\nThat the young lady accepts money for specialised personal services was a negative to the poster, and to those who posted comments.\n\nNow, each to their own, and I am in no way saying the poster did anything wrong in not wanting to pursue the SR due to the young ladies occupation. I, personally, would find it hard to sugar date a dentist. I just don't like dentists.\n\nBut, I thought why do we seem to immediately condemn someone who is a sex worker if they are looking for an SR?\n\nAre these ladies somehow unworthy? \n\nI guess any escort who decided to pursue a SR would be significantly compromising her income to have an SR, compared to using the same time to see Johns / Punters, so can't imagine their motivation it is financially oriented.\n\nI have sugar dated a couple of current and ex sex workers. They were looking for exactly what most of us say we are looking for in an SR, a well defined mutually beneficial relationship, which is more than just a transactional sex for money thing.",

            "body": "There has been this ongoing battle between \"Team Transactional\" and \"Team Relationship\" for a long time.  I don't agree with the tension.  I believe there is a need for both, but I do believe they are at different ends of the Bowl.\n\nI look at Sugar Dating as more of a continuum, with very transactional sex for money NSA arrangements on one end and Sugar Relationships that feel more like normal dating with mutual attraction and chemistry, but with boundaries and financial support on the other.\n\nI personally, look for a Sugar Relationship, but I understand and respect the need for very transactional types of arrangements.  Many married, or otherwise attached men and women can't, or don't want to, develop an emotional connection, but still have unmet sexual needs.  Keeping things business like and No Strings Attached benefits them.  Keeping emotions out of the arrangement allows women to treat it like a business, provide a valuable service and make more money.  I believe prostitution should be legal in the US.  It is not illegal because it is dangerous, it is dangerous because it is illegal.   Legalizing it would reduce crime, STDs, unwanted pregancies, sex trafficking and child sex trafficking...like it has in much of Europe.\n\nI only wish both sides had more respect and appreciation for the other.",

            "body": "OP, I agree completely. I think the issue is this.\n\nThere is a strong societal stigma to sex work, something that most of us have accepted without thinking. We want to avoid that stigma so we tell ourselves that exchanging money for time and sex this way is not sex work. Thus we perpetuate the stigma against sex work, rather than questioning it and moving past it.\n\nThe irony to this is that most of society sees sugar as sex work, does not draw the distinction, so almost everyone hides sugaring, just like escorts and their clients hide their activities. Google and Apple are banning sugar apps because they consider this sex work. That's wrong, but not because it isn't sex work.\n\nOn the plus side, we are having this discussion, more of us are more open about our sugaring and more supportive of sex work in general so I think there is progress. But there will remain a sort of reflexive, reactionary faction in the sugar bowl who cry that this isn't sex work and disdain sex work.\n\nThe part that really bugs me is the misogyny of this, the disdain for women who are open and honest about their sexuality, not ashamed to use it to their benefit and as they please. Because the subtext to avoiding women who are perceived as acting like escorts is that it's wrong for a woman to say she likes sex and money and has no problem openly and honestly combining those two.\n\nLet women define their relationships however it works best for them and don't judge them for it. Men have had this privilege forever, it's time to share it",

If a sugar baby has more than one SD is that not the same as an escort who sees 1-2 regulars a week for overnights and only offers girl friend experiences? The only difference is the sb is making less money lol. I also thought being a SD implies an age gap, escorting doesn't. The screening is a bit more strict with escorting, the financial obligations a lot more clear (deposits, payment before intimacy/arriving) and allegedly a lot of \"SD's\" are just men that got blackballed from seeing escorts because they insist on no condoms/being overly emotionally invested/cheap/demanding. So if you've been a sb in the bowl for any longer than 4 weeks it the behavior of   some \"sd's\" makes a lot of sense because some of *them* are more experienced with escorts. I think a lot of SD's dislike SW because it's embarrassing for them to admit that they're paying for sex and a fantasy either way. Most SB's aren't treating their SD's like regular vanilla partners because if we did we'd be kicked to the curb lol. Imo sugaring is money=sex and the chemistry on top/dates is the icing on the cake. The reality is if I told my SD today I didn't feel like having sex for a few weeks, I'd be gone. Why? Because he isn't here for my lovely personality. And vice versa, though we actually enjoy eachother. SD's condemn SW's because escorts don't benefit them, sugar relationships do. SB's accept less money for more time/emotional labor and provide the gfe on an ongoing basis. SB's get more financial consistency, and maybe a few gifts, maybe a vacation or two. Each life seemingly has its benefits so I feel there's no difference between a John/SD and a SB/escort. There are creeps/rinsers on both sides.",

As a society, we better hope it isn't because women have a psychological and emotional need to feel loved and cared for; men don't, especially young men trying to get their needs met.  The escort gets something of value, top $ for her services, the SB gets her emotional, mental, and financial needs met.  The hook-up girls don't get anything, and people wonder why so many guys are being accused of rape.  The women who wear these pu$$y hats and yell and scream their hatred for men are victims of this.",

They\u2019re obviously compromising their income because, as I can imagine, what sugar bowl offers is pennies compared to what they earn so money is definitely not the driving aspect of them getting into SR. I guess some men just don\u2019t want to accept the fact that their fantasy of a young beautiful woman being genuinely attracted to a man older than her father could be untrue.",

Therefore it follows that if sex work was without any stigma, women could easily become independent of men and where would the world be if women were somehow able to take easy money from men that the men worked so hard for.\n\nI think sex work should be 'normal' like any other product in the service industry and we could still have all the layers we have now - but without the stigma.\n\nI'll go and grab a coffee.",

To put it another way: I've had many SRs that transitioned from PPM to allowance.  You know how our SR changed?  It didn't, not one bit.  It was the same great SR, we had a great connection and did awesome things for each other on PPM, and the same after we transitioned to allowance. I have no idea how bad my SR would have to suck, for it to be some major qualitative, transformational change that we move from PPM every Wednesday to allowance on the 1st and 15th.   There's some psychological comfort in the predictability, but no substantive difference in the SR.  If I believed an SR was sexwork on PPM, I'd believe it's sexwork on allowance.  If I don't believe it's sexwork on PPM, I wouldn't believe it's sexwork on allowance.",

In my mind, there is zero expectation of any commitment or emotional connection in SW.  I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not a useful expectation.\nWith an SB, I strongly prefer something closer to a \u201creal\u201d/vanilla relationship.  Transactional is hugely unromantic, and having an SB who is there because she wants to be is close to the other end of the spectrum.\nI\u2019m sure many SWs prefer sugar dating for lots of reasons, but I cannot imagine they make more money at it in my area.  I think that brings us to the clear issue for most SBs I\u2019ve know:  what is the reason the SB is there?\nHere are the reasons I\u2019ve commonly seen:\n1. Money.  I\u2019d consider that mostly sex work, but it\u2019s ok\n2. Being treated well.  I like that one, and seek it\n3. Liking older guys.  That\u2019s closer to vanilla, and I find it\u2019s often a good sign that the SR will be fun for both of us\n4. Not wanting a traditional relationship.  These are often poly types, but sometimes also into some kink.  Can be awesome for the right SD.\n5. Seeking mentoring.  Uncommon, but fun if there\u2019s a good fit.\n6. Wanting to travel/enjoy a lifestyle.  I\u2019ve enjoyed these, when the fit is good enough to have someone that close for a long trip.\n\nMoney is an important reason for most, but it was not the ONLY reason for the best SRs I had.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s partly my taste.  I\u2019m not keen on Splenda daddies trying to take money off the table entirely- it\u2019s a fine attraction and a way to open doors- but I\u2019d never buy the bigger presents, like cars or houses, for the SBs who were strictly PPM.\nThe key to great sugaring is to be super open about what you want and what you offer.  If you don\u2019t want to be treated like a \u201cclient\u201d\u2026.next!  And for the SBs, if you don\u2019t like a skimpy daddy\u2026next!",

There are all sorts of technicalities, some that seem trivial to me, that people are twisting around to try to justify their view.  The emotional connection, commitment, genuine caring, these are the actual big things that separate sugar from other activities.  The focus on things like exactly what day and timing allowance is given, is just really about preferred practices, not what defines sugar.\n\nI've felt for a long time this is an inseparable gap between two completely different groups in sugar.  Those for whom the technicalities and timing around money and sex are what defines sugar as sugar (and any variation from those technicalities makes it escorting no matter what the overall relationship is like), and those for whom the relationship and overall experience (including commitment, emotional connection, etc) is what defines sugar apart from other activities.  The two groups aren't going to convince each other of anything, but I guess we'll have fun arguing",

Perhaps it\u2019s become acceptable to some ladies to accept far less in sugar arrangements now than they did years ago, which could explain why I didn\u2019t do particularly well on SA\u2026 there\u2019s definitely a cheaper mindset there than there has been with all my SDs, whom I met elsewhere.

But our relationship went past that - and it was something else.  \n\nWhich brings me to - I don't see any relevance back to the post you are referring to.  His issue was being referred to as a client.  They weren't a match.  She may very well be a match for someone else.\n\nI'm not a match for SBs/POTs that only want to do PPM / strictly NSA.

Not using the word client would primarily be to create the illusion, more than anything else.  Fair enough.  \n\nOther SRs - and what many of us either search for - or flat out consider to be an SR (I'm trying to avoid gate keeping here) - are relationship based.  It's not an illusion - the SB would not consider herself a sex worker either.  And if neither the SD, nor the SB considers it sex work - who is being fooled?  Seems to me like they are both after the same thing.",

There is nothing about being an active or former anything that would make it impossible for someone to be a fine SB.  And I've never really taken a position in the \"is it sexwork?\" wars because frankly, I don't care -- I don't look at sexwork as bad, and if we're all sexworkers and clients, who cares?  Doesn't change a thing about how I feel about my SB (and former SBs), or about myself.   But what sugar most definitely is, is different from a typical escort experience and sugar has different norms, processes, and values -- that's not inherently good or bad, but I'm looking for a sugar experience.\n\nMy impression of why so many SDs avoid escorts is because as a practical matter,  many SDs have met a POT and it's clear they are actually an escort offering an escort experience -- maybe she's lightly sprinkled it with sugar, and honestly believes she's doing the same thing we all are.  Maybe another way to say it: if she acts like an SB to the point that I can't tell she's an escort, what do I care? That's just not usually how it works.\n\nTL;DR: they are not \"unworthy\", but most are not SBs.",

But then they may get fed up and annoyed when the whales and the good SDs do not take them up on their offers, and they are treated like they are escorts and not SBs. Because they aren't SBs. Maybe a rare exception to the rule is a former escort turned SB, who is genuinly trying to make a real go of this lifestyle, and is trying to overcome her learnt nature of escorting that has become engrained. BUT i am sure those are very rare. Whereas most SWs may call themselves SBs, yet see anyone who pays the price, they try to milk every dollar for every minute out of an \"SD\" etc... those are the more common of the two. \n\nAnd this sub is against escorts trying to use this lifestyle for those purposes.

They, and more than a few SBs, take a self righteous pose that it's not sex work, sex work is a dirty thing they wouldn't do. And they do this solely to assuage their conscience, to convince themselves that what they're doing isn't wrong because they haven't crossed that line.\n\nSex work is a bad thing and sugar is good. Wrong on two counts - sex work isn't bad, and sugar is sex work.\n\nSo here's my view.\n\n1. By any definition, sugar is sex work.\n2. Most SDs want their SB to behave exactly the way a good GFE escort does with a regular client, except they want them to lie a little more about the nature of the relationship.\n3. There are definitely SBs and escorts who are pretty much indistinguishable, and it is impossible to draw a line that has all escorts on one side and all SBs on the other. Try.\n4. The tells guys use to make a judgment about whether a woman is a real SB or an escort generally are not really applicable, keeping in mind that a good escort is a very talented performer whose job is to fulfill men's fantasies.\n5. The bias against sex work, and the more general misogyny here is something I find very, very disappointing.\n\nIf you want to have an open, honest, SR, you need to start by admitting that it's sex work.",

I'm actually tempted to laugh every time a fake-boob fake-ass girl is called hot (most likely that's your definition of \"hot\" =)) ) and those kinds of girls are more likely to enter a rich guy's harem than anyone =)))\n\nIt's actually the super rich guys who are in shorter supply. Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).  LOL, you must have been living with gold diggers for the large part of your life for you to think some average and better-earning guys can't secure a decent partner =))",

If people spend a significant amount of time and emotional investment into a sugar relationship, that is not a feature of escort-client relationship. We can comb through SFL to discover that people want a genuine connection and often find something real and enduring. \n\nYou can call sugaring dating sex work.

If people aren't interested in an escort, let's not act as if sex work is sex work, glossing over the nuances. \n\n\rPeople make all kinds of trades in relationships and romance, explicitly or not. Some people want financial stability, others want physical attraction. These trades take place all the time outside the sugar bowl. \n\nWe cannot control how people see us, but I'm not holding it against women (or men) that don't identify as a sex worker.

It\u2019s a male dominated and centered sub and the way women/SBs are spoken about are disproportionately worse than the way SDs are spoken of. SBs are encouraged to post profile reviews, which in and of itself are not a bad thing, but if you comb through the comments you\u2019ll see so many crass/rude/derogatory remarks made about the SB. SBs are also held to a much higher standard than SDs, presumably due to the power dynamic and the mindset that he is paying so he should get what he wants no matter what. This double standard knows no boundary, starting with the SBs profile (her photos and text) and extends to the M&G and beyond. One wrong word, one little mess up, one instance of being human it seems and there is little grace or room for compromise. Whereas an SD can have a shit profile, show up to a M&G wearing yesterday\u2019s wrinkly clothes and still have the audacity to nitpick the woman he\u2019s meeting with. The majority of posts seem to be negative in nature, any many center around some sort of SB involved grievance. Positive, feel good posts are few and far between. Women are often spoken of and referred to as commodities or objects, and the few SDs that challenge this type of language are much appreciated. Semantics? Maybe. Yes I understand this goes back to the supply/demand and the power play, but since you asked about SLF and misogyny I figured this is appropriate.",

If you want to call it mere misogyny then ok, but I think it\u2019s a different issue. Between that and the reports of rampant sexting make men look Aspbergerish lacking social skills. Many of the men claim to want a real relationship and to be wanted for more than being an ATM, yet are incapable of reciprocating and treating the woman as more than sex (and/or kink) dispensers. \n\nSo yeah it\u2019s sad.

And to be fair, there are some less appealing men who don't treat their SBs either. \n\nThere are calzones, and there are paninis. They are both good for what they are.

Sure not even normal relationship would last long w/o these for long, however the market transactionality of \"dropping bad supplier/customer\" opportunistically is less pronounced. Non-transactional relationships are about having faith in the other.

I\u2019m not planning to marry him and he\u2019s paying me so I\u2019m emotionally easy going about his wife or his communication style etc. \n\nSex work is like a lot of other sales jobs. You figure out what they want and show them you\u2019ve got it. And honestly the men just want you to do what they want. Theres layers to it of course cus some people want bossy or bratty or even \u201cnegative\u201d experiences etc, but you just have to play the game.",

The escort gets something of value, top $ for her services, the SB gets her emotional, mental, and financial needs met.  The hook-up girls don't get anything, and people wonder why so many guys are being accused of rape.

To put it another way: I've had many SRs that transitioned from PPM to allowance.  You know how our SR changed?  It didn't, not one bit.  It was the same great SR, we had a great connection and did awesome things for each other on PPM, and the same after we transitioned to allowance. I have no idea how bad my SR would have to suck, for it to be some major qualitative, transformational change that we move from PPM every Wednesday to allowance on the 1st and 15th.   There's some psychological comfort in the predictability, but no substantive difference in the SR.  If I believed an SR was sexwork on PPM, I'd believe it's sexwork on allowance.  If I don't believe it's sexwork on PPM, I wouldn't believe it's sexwork on allowance.",

There are all sorts of technicalities, some that seem trivial to me, that people are twisting around to try to justify their view.  The emotional connection, commitment, genuine caring, these are the actual big things that separate sugar from other activities.  The focus on things like exactly what day and timing allowance is given, is just really about preferred practices, not what defines sugar.\n\nI've felt for a long time this is an inseparable gap between two completely different groups in sugar.  Those for whom the technicalities and timing around money and sex are what defines sugar as sugar (and any variation from those technicalities makes it escorting no matter what the overall relationship is like), and those for whom the relationship and overall experience (including commitment, emotional connection, etc) is what defines sugar apart from other activities.  The two groups aren't going to convince each other of anything, but I guess we'll have fun arguing",

They, and more than a few SBs, take a self righteous pose that it's not sex work, sex work is a dirty thing they wouldn't do. And they do this solely to assuage their conscience, to convince themselves that what they're doing isn't wrong because they haven't crossed that line.\n\nSex work is a bad thing and sugar is good. Wrong on two counts - sex work isn't bad, and sugar is sex work.\n\nSo here's my view.\n\n1. By any definition, sugar is sex work.\n2. Most SDs want their SB to behave exactly the way a good GFE escort does with a regular client, except they want them to lie a little more about the nature of the relationship.\n3. There are definitely SBs and escorts who are pretty much indistinguishable, and it is impossible to draw a line that has all escorts on one side and all SBs on the other. Try.\n4. The tells guys use to make a judgment about whether a woman is a real SB or an escort generally are not really applicable, keeping in mind that a good escort is a very talented performer whose job is to fulfill men's fantasies.\n5. The bias against sex work, and the more general misogyny here is something I find very, very disappointing.\n\nIf you want to have an open, honest, SR, you need to start by admitting that it's sex work.",

So they are no way in short supply, grow a brain. Go to, say, Paris or Madrid and you'll see decent to good looking girls who know how to dress everywhere. =))) It is just that not all of them are conditioned to be money slaves ready to enter a rich guy's harem, grow your brain. I'm actually tempted to laugh every time a fake-boob fake-ass girl is called hot (most likely that's your definition of \"hot\" =)) ) and those kinds of girls are more likely to enter a rich guy's harem than anyone =)))\n\nIt's actually the super rich guys who are in shorter supply. Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).  LOL, you must have been living with gold diggers for the large part of your life for you to think some average and better-earning guys can't secure a decent partner =))",

If people spend a significant amount of time and emotional investment into a sugar relationship, that is not a feature of escort-client relationship. We can comb through SFL to discover that people want a genuine connection and often find something real and enduring. \n\nYou can call sugaring dating sex work. But sugar dating and soliciting the services of an escort are not the same thing. If people aren't interested in an escort, let's not act as if sex work is sex work, glossing over the nuances. \n\n\rPeople make all kinds of trades in relationships and romance, explicitly or not. Some people want financial stability, others want physical attraction. These trades take place all the time outside the sugar bowl. \n\nWe cannot control how people see us, but I'm not holding it against women (or men) that don't identify as a sex worker. There are people that want a genuinely want relationship that comes with clear, defined support. This goes beyond an exchange of sex and money.",

It\u2019s a male dominated and centered sub and the way women/SBs are spoken about are disproportionately worse than the way SDs are spoken of. SBs are encouraged to post profile reviews, which in and of itself are not a bad thing, but if you comb through the comments you\u2019ll see so many crass/rude/derogatory remarks made about the SB. SBs are also held to a much higher standard than SDs, presumably due to the power dynamic and the mindset that he is paying so he should get what he wants no matter what. This double standard knows no boundary, starting with the SBs profile (her photos and text) and extends to the M&G and beyond. One wrong word, one little mess up, one instance of being human it seems and there is little grace or room for compromise. Whereas an SD can have a shit profile, show up to a M&G wearing yesterday\u2019s wrinkly clothes and still have the audacity to nitpick the woman he\u2019s meeting with. The majority of posts seem to be negative in nature, any many center around some sort of SB involved grievance. Positive, feel good posts are few and far between. Women are often spoken of and referred to as commodities or objects, and the few SDs that challenge this type of language are much appreciated. Semantics? Maybe. Yes I understand this goes back to the supply/demand and the power play, but since you asked about SLF and misogyny I figured this is appropriate.",

And to be fair, there are some less appealing men who don't treat their SBs either. \n\nThere are calzones, and there are paninis. They are both good for what they are.

Sure not even normal relationship would last long w/o these for long, however the market transactionality of \"dropping bad supplier/customer\" opportunistically is less pronounced. Non-transactional relationships are about having faith in the other. Sure there can be money flowing in one direction, but only if she doesn't drop me after \"baby, there will be nothing for 6 months because markets are down\" we can talk about relationship with legs in a meaningful sense.",

As a society, we better hope it isn't because women have a psychological and emotional need to feel loved and cared for; men don't, especially young men trying to get their needs met.  The escort gets something of value, top $ for her services, the SB gets her emotional, mental, and financial needs met.  The hook-up girls don't get anything, and people wonder why so many guys are being accused of rape.  The women who wear these pu$$y hats and yell and scream their hatred for men are victims of this.",

Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).

If people aren't interested in an escort, let's not act as if sex work is sex work, glossing over the nuances. \n\n\rPeople make all kinds of trades in relationships and romance, explicitly or not. Some people want financial stability, others want physical attraction. These trades take place all the time outside the sugar bowl. \n\nWe cannot control how people see us, but I'm not holding it against women (or men) that don't identify as a sex worker.

It\u2019s a male dominated and centered sub and the way women/SBs are spoken about are disproportionately worse than the way SDs are spoken of. SBs are encouraged to post profile reviews, which in and of itself are not a bad thing, but if you comb through the comments you\u2019ll see so many crass/rude/derogatory remarks made about the SB. SBs are also held to a much higher standard than SDs, presumably due to the power dynamic and the mindset that he is paying so he should get what he wants no matter what. This double standard knows no boundary, starting with the SBs profile (her photos and text) and extends to the M&G and beyond. One wrong word, one little mess up, one instance of being human it seems and there is little grace or room for compromise. Whereas an SD can have a shit profile, show up to a M&G wearing yesterday\u2019s wrinkly clothes and still have the audacity to nitpick the woman he\u2019s meeting with. The majority of posts seem to be negative in nature, any many center around some sort of SB involved grievance. Positive, feel good posts are few and far between. Women are often spoken of and referred to as commodities or objects, and the few SDs that challenge this type of language are much appreciated. Semantics? Maybe. Yes I understand this goes back to the supply/demand and the power play, but since you asked about SLF and misogyny I figured this is appropriate.",

I\u2019ve heard people criticize kink, specifically submission as internalized misogyny, and totally disagree with that **except** that people who are submissive should look for a dominant partner who understands consent. If you are into humiliation, objectification, degradation then see r/humiliation_kink rather than placing yourself into a bad situation with someone who is abusive. Again the difference is consent as well as real aftercare. \n\nA lot of what goes on might \u201clook like\u201d kink without being kink done correctly. Degrading a stranger who is asking for advice is abusive not kinky.",

The escort gets something of value, top $ for her services, the SB gets her emotional, mental, and financial needs met.  The hook-up girls don't get anything, and people wonder why so many guys are being accused of rape.

It\u2019s a male dominated and centered sub and the way women/SBs are spoken about are disproportionately worse than the way SDs are spoken of. SBs are encouraged to post profile reviews, which in and of itself are not a bad thing, but if you comb through the comments you\u2019ll see so many crass/rude/derogatory remarks made about the SB. SBs are also held to a much higher standard than SDs, presumably due to the power dynamic and the mindset that he is paying so he should get what he wants no matter what. This double standard knows no boundary, starting with the SBs profile (her photos and text) and extends to the M&G and beyond. One wrong word, one little mess up, one instance of being human it seems and there is little grace or room for compromise. Whereas an SD can have a shit profile, show up to a M&G wearing yesterday\u2019s wrinkly clothes and still have the audacity to nitpick the woman he\u2019s meeting with. The majority of posts seem to be negative in nature, any many center around some sort of SB involved grievance. Positive, feel good posts are few and far between. Women are often spoken of and referred to as commodities or objects, and the few SDs that challenge this type of language are much appreciated. Semantics? Maybe. Yes I understand this goes back to the supply/demand and the power play, but since you asked about SLF and misogyny I figured this is appropriate.",

Many of the men claim to want a real relationship and to be wanted for more than being an ATM, yet are incapable of reciprocating and treating the woman as more than sex (and/or kink) dispensers. \n\nSo yeah it\u2019s sad.

If you are into humiliation, objectification, degradation then see r/humiliation_kink rather than placing yourself into a bad situation with someone who is abusive.

The escort gets something of value, top $ for her services, the SB gets her emotional, mental, and financial needs met.  The hook-up girls don't get anything, and people wonder why so many guys are being accused of rape.

That's why most European countries have adopted similar policies.",

I'm actually tempted to laugh every time a fake-boob fake-ass girl is called hot (most likely that's your definition of \"hot\" =)) ) and those kinds of girls are more likely to enter a rich guy's harem than anyone =)))\n\nIt's actually the super rich guys who are in shorter supply. Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).

I'm actually tempted to laugh every time a fake-boob fake-ass girl is called hot (most likely that's your definition of \"hot\" =)) ) and those kinds of girls are more likely to enter a rich guy's harem than anyone =)))\n\nIt's actually the super rich guys who are in shorter supply. Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).

It disappoints me to see men talk and joke about women the way they do, knowing many SBs read their words. It would be just like standing in a crowd of SDs and SBs and overhearing crude and hurtful conversation, and yet that doesn\u2019t seem to phase anyone. I caught a lot of heat yesterday for vehemently commenting on many posts /comments like the ones I describe and it\u2019s bc I know how many young, impressionable SBs are lurking on this forum and absorbing the dialogue. I myself am not young or naive about life and relationships and the way the world works and yet I find that even I will start to internalize the generalizations made on this sub and have to step away from it for a long while to reset. \n\nWe may be SBs, we may be SWs (however you define us in your mind) but behind the username are real people \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f we all enter the bowl with different expectations and bring with us different experiences, but I\u2019d like to hope the common denominator would be kindness and decency toward each other.

I'm actually tempted to laugh every time a fake-boob fake-ass girl is called hot (most likely that's your definition of \"hot\" =)) ) and those kinds of girls are more likely to enter a rich guy's harem than anyone =)))\n\nIt's actually the super rich guys who are in shorter supply. Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).

Go to, say, Paris or Madrid and you'll see decent to good looking girls who know how to dress everywhere. =))) It is just that not all of them are conditioned to be money slaves ready to enter a rich guy's harem, grow your brain. I'm actually tempted to laugh every time a fake-boob fake-ass girl is called hot (most likely that's your definition of \"hot\" =)) ) and those kinds of girls are more likely to enter a rich guy's harem than anyone =)))\n\nIt's actually the super rich guys who are in shorter supply. Yet, 1% of the good-looking girls are enough to surpass their demands already, leaving 99% for the other guys. Many girls are not dumb as you think. Although decent girls aren't likely to bone a 40k guys ( and I didn't object that anywhere), I'm speaking about 100k girls are OK with guys earning close to 100k. And  if guys have matching personalities - relationships are going good, decent girls wouldn't trade them for rich guys who aren't compatible ( because breakup with rich guys are forseen, duh).  LOL, you must have been living with gold diggers for the large part of your life for you to think some average and better-earning guys can't secure a decent partner =))",
