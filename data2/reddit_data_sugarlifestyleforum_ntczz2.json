I have run across girls that are offering pics/videos for sale on snapchat that also offer crazy low rates for meetups. I usually find them on Tinder. I can't say with 100% certainty, but that almost surely has to be a scam. A lot of these types of scammers use Tinder premium accounts that allow them to constantly change location. The biggest giveaway is that they almost always ask you for your location right away. They change their location so often they can't keep up with it. If you never give away your location and press them for theirs, they'll give you the runaround and won't answer. Red Flag. If you match on Tinder you shouldn't need to ask where they live. You have a distance range set. It's assumed they're local.",

Tricking would be done by a john usually, I think. \n\nSee rap lyrics\n\"It ain't tricking if you got it\" \nThe lyric endorses a broader definition of tricking than explicitly paying directly for sex, but same general principle. Spending money on a person with the goal of having/continuing to have sex with them, albeit likely without an explicit agreement and usually in a relationship that likely would eschew traditional sex worker terminology (perhaps not so dissimilar from sugaring?)",

But I *usually* hear it in the context of dudes spending money on a girl with the hope/expectation of sex. Like I've had guy friends say they \"tricked off\" some money on a girl they were hoping to have sex with. Or they were \"tricking off\" some money at the mall with the hope/expectation of sex. \n\nThis is getting a little in the weeds, lol.

I can't say with 100% certainty, but that almost surely has to be a scam. A lot of these types of scammers use Tinder premium accounts that allow them to constantly change location. The biggest giveaway is that they almost always ask you for your location right away. They change their location so often they can't keep up with it. If you never give away your location and press them for theirs, they'll give you the runaround and won't answer. Red Flag. If you match on Tinder you shouldn't need to ask where they live. You have a distance range set. It's assumed they're local.",

Like I've had guy friends say they \"tricked off\" some money on a girl they were hoping to have sex with.

I can't say with 100% certainty, but that almost surely has to be a scam. A lot of these types of scammers use Tinder premium accounts that allow them to constantly change location. The biggest giveaway is that they almost always ask you for your location right away. They change their location so often they can't keep up with it. If you never give away your location and press them for theirs, they'll give you the runaround and won't answer. Red Flag. If you match on Tinder you shouldn't need to ask where they live. You have a distance range set. It's assumed they're local.",

I have run across girls that are offering pics/videos for sale on snapchat that also offer crazy low rates for meetups. I usually find them on Tinder. I can't say with 100% certainty, but that almost surely has to be a scam. A lot of these types of scammers use Tinder premium accounts that allow them to constantly change location. The biggest giveaway is that they almost always ask you for your location right away. They change their location so often they can't keep up with it. If you never give away your location and press them for theirs, they'll give you the runaround and won't answer. Red Flag. If you match on Tinder you shouldn't need to ask where they live. You have a distance range set. It's assumed they're local.",

I have run across girls that are offering pics/videos for sale on snapchat that also offer crazy low rates for meetups. I usually find them on Tinder. I can't say with 100% certainty, but that almost surely has to be a scam. A lot of these types of scammers use Tinder premium accounts that allow them to constantly change location. The biggest giveaway is that they almost always ask you for your location right away. They change their location so often they can't keep up with it. If you never give away your location and press them for theirs, they'll give you the runaround and won't answer. Red Flag. If you match on Tinder you shouldn't need to ask where they live. You have a distance range set. It's assumed they're local.",
