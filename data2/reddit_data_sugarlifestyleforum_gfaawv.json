Clearly we can tease about the situation but also have empathy that it sucks to be Dan.\n\nBut also....why should she be concerned about him or his marriage? He's a big boy, he chose this, he chose to take a calculated risk, knowing his wife COULD find out. Anyone that is married and getting into this should know that. There is always the fact that the spouse might install spy software, follow the other spouse, friends see the cheating spouse out w another lady and tell the other spouse, etc. Anything could happen. Hope for the best but also...prepare for the worst.",
