Ji Hyo's always seemed less comfortable and is far less vocal and proactive than she used to be, and it took some others some time to adjust (including YSC despite him being a comedian). They don't really try to highlight the guests as much, now, with the cast kind of just doing their thing each episode and worrying less about themes or promoting a guest's project.\n\nI still enjoy the show, but especially with Kwang Soo gone (always my favorite), and the limits on travel due to Covid, it's different, yeah. This year they have been doing more of the classic RM stuff, though, like nametag ripping, finding clues hidden around locations, spies, and sports/physical games. The current PD has used a lot of that stuff, to the point it's worrisome sometimes since the longtime members all have chronic back issues. The episodes with the women's volleyball team stood out, for instance, as a nice throwback episode.",

            "body": "YSC and JSM injected a lot of energy, but the show started shifting more and more to a focus on talk and gags versus physical challenges, active games and running, forcing the cast to adjust. Ji Hyo's always seemed less comfortable and is far less vocal and proactive than she used to be, and it took some others some time to adjust (including YSC despite him being a comedian). They don't really try to highlight the guests as much, now, with the cast kind of just doing their thing each episode and worrying less about themes or promoting a guest's project.\n\nI still enjoy the show, but especially with Kwang Soo gone (always my favorite), and the limits on travel due to Covid, it's different, yeah. This year they have been doing more of the classic RM stuff, though, like nametag ripping, finding clues hidden around locations, spies, and sports/physical games. The current PD has used a lot of that stuff, to the point it's worrisome sometimes since the longtime members all have chronic back issues. The episodes with the women's volleyball team stood out, for instance, as a nice throwback episode.",
