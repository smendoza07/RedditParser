The benefits of short hair (these are all my opinion) lower maintenance it takes less time to style it, another positive is it takes less products (shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, dyes, etc) but I think the only draw back is regular-semi regular trips to the barber. I again say this from my personal experience because 1 I don\u2019t like people very much and 2 the people that cut my hair are usually very chatty and deep dive into things like religion and politics which overwhelms me, having long hair oh boy summer gets hotter because your hair traps the heat, it takes more time to detangle and comb though my hair it also takes more product to care for it, windy days + your shoulder length hair being down = your nightmare, you can and will lay on it if it\u2019s down and snagging can and will occur. The pros I get to try new hairstyles I never had before, I have curly hair so I get to experiment with that, being a metal head I head bang and I love seeing and feeling my hair bounce and flip around this was and is the major reason why I started growing out my hair, and you look and feel more majestic (at least I do).",
