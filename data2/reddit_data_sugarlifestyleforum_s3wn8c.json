    "body": "[Once again](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/g7cf51/enough/) SLF is a sugar sub. Not a political sub. Not a place to discuss how you cured covid with a multivitamin. We understand that covid is something that is universally impacting everyone globally. And that people have strong feelings about the vaccines and how things should be handled but this is not the place for those type of discussions. You're on reddit if you have a burning desire to have debates about covid/vaccines a simple search will yield communities that are better suited for those conversations.  \n\n**Acceptable discusions about Covid on SLF**\n\n* I got covid.\n\n* My sugar partner got covid.\n\n* I got rejected because I am or am not vaccinated.\n\n* Creative ways to date during lockdown.\n\n**Unacceptable discussions about Covid**\n\n* Liberals/Conservatives are Stupid about covid, vaccines, etc\n\n* You are stupid if you take or don't take the vaccine\n\n* Covid is not real. It's manufactured by the liberal media\n\n* You don't need vaccines, you can cure covid by spinning counter clockwise in a circle\n\n**Failure to adhere to these guidelines in either comments and/or posts can  lead to your permanent removal from this sub.**",

Have you met her or spoken to her on the phone?  \n\nIf it\u2019s any sort of scam you have to look for grammatical inconsistencies. There are two formats of writing; MLA and AP. Both have very specific rules regarding punctuation, spacing etc. Even for those who are totally unaware, they will stick to the same format and rules when they write. So someone who always puts two spaces after a period wouldn\u2019t randomly put one space after a period, because the typing and punctuation is a subconscious choice. No one would randomly switch. \n\nI would compare the texts against the time of day because it\u2019s usually a multi person operation. Also, it\u2019s going to be human nature for you to be more inquisitive and pursue her more as she increasingly puts less effort and less characters (like number of letters) into her texts.  Whether or not it\u2019s a scam it\u2019s a common tactic to gain the upper hand. The more unavailable and un interested she seems, the more you want her.  \n\nI\u2019d just be careful.

Have you met her or spoken to her on the phone?  \n\nIf it\u2019s any sort of scam you have to look for grammatical inconsistencies. There are two formats of writing; MLA and AP. Both have very specific rules regarding punctuation, spacing etc. Even for those who are totally unaware, they will stick to the same format and rules when they write. So someone who always puts two spaces after a period wouldn\u2019t randomly put one space after a period, because the typing and punctuation is a subconscious choice. No one would randomly switch. \n\nI would compare the texts against the time of day because it\u2019s usually a multi person operation. Also, it\u2019s going to be human nature for you to be more inquisitive and pursue her more as she increasingly puts less effort and less characters (like number of letters) into her texts.  Whether or not it\u2019s a scam it\u2019s a common tactic to gain the upper hand. The more unavailable and un interested she seems, the more you want her.  \n\nI\u2019d just be careful.
