    "body": "Absolutely over the moon about everything that's happened over the last few days. My SD has been doing lots of extra little things here and there: improving my home, buying my groceries, filling my car with gas, reading to me at night before bed when we're together, giving extra little gifts that remind him of me. The other day he gave me the complete box set of Hey Arnold and the first two seasons of Ren and Stimpy, and said he'd never seen anyone so genuinely excited or grateful for a $30 gift. I had to explain to him that it's not the amount spent but the fact that he remembered I enjoyed those shows, and thought enough of me to buy them when he came across them.\n\nWe've also been spending more time together, going on dates and even making a list of fun/romantic/silly date ideas for the future (we're up to 107 so far). The way he looks at me, speaks to me, touches me, considers me. The way he gets my weird sense of humor and like to banter back. The way he holds me all night when we sleep together, and doesn't let go. I've without a doubt fallen head over heels for this man. And he says he's fallen for me as well. He wants to bring me down to his family Easter and introduce me to his kids, parents, and extended family. He wants to bring me into every aspect of his life, and he wants people to know we're together. It feels unreal, taking this step, but I'm beyond elated. I've been trying so hard to keep my feelings for him in check, but now I know he feels the same. It's scary to be diving in like this, and not something I ever considered would happen to me, but I'm doing it! This man is the most incredible person I have ever met, and of all the women he could have chosen, he wants me.",
