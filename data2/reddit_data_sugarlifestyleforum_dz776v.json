    "body": "After going through the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/dn19hm/reconnecting_with_a_sd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) replies, I messaged him saying that he ran through my mind and basically how I would like to resume what we had because it was good and I missed it. Also threw in a bit of how immature my actions were and I now know that wasn\u2019t the right time to do what I did.\n\nHe responded very well to my messages and said he  missed me as well. Well, this was about 3 weeks ago and we\u2019ve already picked things up from where it stopped. It\u2019s been so great rekindling things with him. We have trips and activities planned already for the next 2 months. \n\nJust wanted to update and say thank you all for the advice \ud83d\udc96",

Life happens, nothing surprising there. Ideally, over the years, be you an SB or SD, you cultivate a circle of sugar mates who, depending on availability and life situations, you can have in your life.\n\nIMHO this is the best of situations, a set of people you see that come in, leave for a time, and come back in, rather than a stream of continuously new and different people.",
