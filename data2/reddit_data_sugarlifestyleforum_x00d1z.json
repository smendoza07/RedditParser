    "body": "I've been involved in this hobby for about 15 years. I've been on Secret Benefits and SA mostly and I have to say that the most annoying part of many a girl's profile is the obligatory \"my time is valuable\" \"don't waste my time, it precious\" lines. This is not an angry vent post. I'm just saying ladies, how did we get to be SD's? A lot of us are older gentleman and we've worked many tens of thousands of hours at our careers and our personal lives. We've given freely a lot of our time for our families, our parents and children and our communities. We're older, don't have as much time left, our time is the most precious lol.\n\nWhen I am talking to a girl, the first question I ask is \"where (generally) do you live?\" so I can accommodate her schedule. And if we are an hour apart I drive the hour to her.\n\nNot venting. I just think it's funny.",

It\u2019s just SD are used to having to work a little in our vanilla dating lives where as hot SBs aren\u2019t use to be in the position of having to compete for an valuable SD attention and therefore gets more annoyed by the time wasters.",

Be it their neighbor, their boss, low-key their boyfriends friend, high-key their supportive childhood male friend, their flatmate, their friends boyfriend, any guys who dms them online, any guy who leaves irate comments on their page online, any guy who sees them on the street, at a nightclub, shopping, gym, opening a door for them. So on and so on and so on. \n\nThe difference is that whereas it's kinda easy for a girl to know if she's into a guy, so you just have to build a cold or dismissive exterior to those you're not. It's much harder to know if someone online is rich and not full of shit though. Especially when those people can rightly say \"I won't pay you til we meet\" because there's women looking to scam a quick buck.",

Didn't matter if it was women 20 years my senior. Suddenly facial hair meant I was predator 101. As someone sensitive to vibes it genuinely stung to be walking about and suddenly see someone getting uncomfortable because you're on at the same path behind them. \n\nI've had times were a girl has rudely rejected me and I wasn't even hitting on her and was instead just being nice and making conversation, but then they were exactly the type who may get that sort of thing. Now, they were definitely unpleasant people so fuck them, but rather than take any of these reactions personally, it's much better to just acknowledge that the simple impression of people wanting to be up in your personal space, is a constant for women, from basic bitch to bombshell, as long as your bmi is under 25 you're feeling it. \n\nIf you're not a hot woman men will likely ignore you and you'll feel shit about yourself forever or until something changes. If you are a hot woman, good luck being anything else without dealing with all the bullshit of people not liking you stepping out of your box. \n\nIt'll only ever be 1 man out of 100 who will bother a woman.  But how many men do you normally pass on a street downtown?\n\nAnyway, off topic of the original comment so /end.",

That can get very frustrating. \n\nOn the other hand, when I organise a meet, I have to set aside an entire day with travel and not being able to start any new trades that day (I day trade on a volatile commodity) so that all costs be time and lost earnings. \n\nSo my time is valuable to. Arguably more financially valuable, but perhaps less relationship valuable (?). \n\nIf I were ri provide a monetary incentive for a meet to encourage the person actually turning up, it would be more about saving my time and money than it is acknowledging her value. Which is not right either. \n\nBut I certainly get why they put it in their profiles. I think it\u2019s a mistake because anything negative on your profile just sends a bad image. \nBut it comes from frustration at the VAST amount of salt daddies out there. \n\nThat has nothing to do with the vast amount of scammers we SDs face and it\u2019s hard to bring people together when we both start off at that level of distrust.",

As someone sensitive to vibes it genuinely stung to be walking about and suddenly see someone getting uncomfortable because you're on at the same path behind them. \n\nI've had times were a girl has rudely rejected me and I wasn't even hitting on her and was instead just being nice and making conversation, but then they were exactly the type who may get that sort of thing. Now, they were definitely unpleasant people so fuck them, but rather than take any of these reactions personally, it's much better to just acknowledge that the simple impression of people wanting to be up in your personal space, is a constant for women, from basic bitch to bombshell, as long as your bmi is under 25 you're feeling it. \n\nIf you're not a hot woman men will likely ignore you and you'll feel shit about yourself forever or until something changes. If you are a hot woman, good luck being anything else without dealing with all the bullshit of people not liking you stepping out of your box. \n\nIt'll only ever be 1 man out of 100 who will bother a woman.

Not discounting her time....but if you are seriously seeking an ongoing consistent arrangement; then chemistry and a real connection is critical for it to work.   Thus investing some time is required.   I prefer keeping it simple and relaxed as here in Florida, casual is preferable.   I don't need a lady to get all dolled up as I look for girl next door types. Again, my preference.   Basically my point here is both parties need to be willing to give.  \n\nAnd if you have so many guys interested and offering you so much, then why are you still on the site and messaging me????",

Didn't matter if it was women 20 years my senior. Suddenly facial hair meant I was predator 101. As someone sensitive to vibes it genuinely stung to be walking about and suddenly see someone getting uncomfortable because you're on at the same path behind them. \n\nI've had times were a girl has rudely rejected me and I wasn't even hitting on her and was instead just being nice and making conversation, but then they were exactly the type who may get that sort of thing. Now, they were definitely unpleasant people so fuck them, but rather than take any of these reactions personally, it's much better to just acknowledge that the simple impression of people wanting to be up in your personal space, is a constant for women, from basic bitch to bombshell, as long as your bmi is under 25 you're feeling it. \n\nIf you're not a hot woman men will likely ignore you and you'll feel shit about yourself forever or until something changes. If you are a hot woman, good luck being anything else without dealing with all the bullshit of people not liking you stepping out of your box. \n\nIt'll only ever be 1 man out of 100 who will bother a woman.  But how many men do you normally pass on a street downtown?\n\nAnyway, off topic of the original comment so /end.",

Didn't matter if it was women 20 years my senior. Suddenly facial hair meant I was predator 101. As someone sensitive to vibes it genuinely stung to be walking about and suddenly see someone getting uncomfortable because you're on at the same path behind them. \n\nI've had times were a girl has rudely rejected me and I wasn't even hitting on her and was instead just being nice and making conversation, but then they were exactly the type who may get that sort of thing. Now, they were definitely unpleasant people so fuck them, but rather than take any of these reactions personally, it's much better to just acknowledge that the simple impression of people wanting to be up in your personal space, is a constant for women, from basic bitch to bombshell, as long as your bmi is under 25 you're feeling it. \n\nIf you're not a hot woman men will likely ignore you and you'll feel shit about yourself forever or until something changes. If you are a hot woman, good luck being anything else without dealing with all the bullshit of people not liking you stepping out of your box. \n\nIt'll only ever be 1 man out of 100 who will bother a woman.  But how many men do you normally pass on a street downtown?\n\nAnyway, off topic of the original comment so /end.",

Suddenly facial hair meant I was predator 101. As someone sensitive to vibes it genuinely stung to be walking about and suddenly see someone getting uncomfortable because you're on at the same path behind them. \n\nI've had times were a girl has rudely rejected me and I wasn't even hitting on her and was instead just being nice and making conversation, but then they were exactly the type who may get that sort of thing. Now, they were definitely unpleasant people so fuck them, but rather than take any of these reactions personally, it's much better to just acknowledge that the simple impression of people wanting to be up in your personal space, is a constant for women, from basic bitch to bombshell, as long as your bmi is under 25 you're feeling it. \n\nIf you're not a hot woman men will likely ignore you and you'll feel shit about yourself forever or until something changes. If you are a hot woman, good luck being anything else without dealing with all the bullshit of people not liking you stepping out of your box. \n\nIt'll only ever be 1 man out of 100 who will bother a woman.  But how many men do you normally pass on a street downtown?\n\nAnyway, off topic of the original comment so /end.",
