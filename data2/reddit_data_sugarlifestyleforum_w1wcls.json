    "body": "My SD had food delivered to our apartment. I was in bed and didn\u2019t want to get up. He got up, got dressed, and went down to the lobby to fetch the food. He then prepared our table and served me food before putting some on his own plate. Not only that, he gave me the all the best bits.\n\nThis man is sought after by people- his time really is money. But he shuffled his meetings and engagements around to accommodate me, and during that time, all his focus was on me. It felt so surreal. I was giddy the entire time. He made me feel so special. \n\n(Found this on my notes app and made me smile \ud83e\udd79)\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I feel powerful not because I think I can control him. I feel powerful because he boosted my self-esteem by A LOT. I feel like I can do anything.",
