The Grass Cutter Sword refers specifically to a Japanese relic sword said to have been taken from a snake by Susanoo and given by the gods to the Japanese emperors (in myth, it was used to cut through a field of grass to stop a fire that would have killed an emperor). \n\nSo there's all these mythology references and subtext that is hard to quickly translate. You want enough to clue the audience into the reference, but you have to balance that against expediency. \n\nIt'd be like an American Cartoon having a lumberjack with a horned helmet scream \"Babe\" when headbutting an enemy. You might translate it to \"Giant Blue Bull\" since it's a reference to Paul Bunyun's giant blue bull from American Folklore.",

The Grass Cutter Sword refers specifically to a Japanese relic sword said to have been taken from a snake by Susanoo and given by the gods to the Japanese emperors (in myth, it was used to cut through a field of grass to stop a fire that would have killed an emperor). \n\nSo there's all these mythology references and subtext that is hard to quickly translate. You want enough to clue the audience into the reference, but you have to balance that against expediency. \n\nIt'd be like an American Cartoon having a lumberjack with a horned helmet scream \"Babe\" when headbutting an enemy. You might translate it to \"Giant Blue Bull\" since it's a reference to Paul Bunyun's giant blue bull from American Folklore.",

The Grass Cutter Sword refers specifically to a Japanese relic sword said to have been taken from a snake by Susanoo and given by the gods to the Japanese emperors (in myth, it was used to cut through a field of grass to stop a fire that would have killed an emperor). \n\nSo there's all these mythology references and subtext that is hard to quickly translate. You want enough to clue the audience into the reference, but you have to balance that against expediency. \n\nIt'd be like an American Cartoon having a lumberjack with a horned helmet scream \"Babe\" when headbutting an enemy. You might translate it to \"Giant Blue Bull\" since it's a reference to Paul Bunyun's giant blue bull from American Folklore.",

The Grass Cutter Sword refers specifically to a Japanese relic sword said to have been taken from a snake by Susanoo and given by the gods to the Japanese emperors (in myth, it was used to cut through a field of grass to stop a fire that would have killed an emperor). \n\nSo there's all these mythology references and subtext that is hard to quickly translate. You want enough to clue the audience into the reference, but you have to balance that against expediency. \n\nIt'd be like an American Cartoon having a lumberjack with a horned helmet scream \"Babe\" when headbutting an enemy. You might translate it to \"Giant Blue Bull\" since it's a reference to Paul Bunyun's giant blue bull from American Folklore.",
