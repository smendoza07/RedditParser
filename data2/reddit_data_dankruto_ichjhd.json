Don\u2019t get me wrong, I disliked all the reincarnation stuff and believe the story of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s rivalry/bond could\u2019ve been told without it. But don\u2019t disregard the fact that Naruto was a reincarnate of someone who despite having immense power, still had to work hard and wasn\u2019t as gifted or quick a learner in comparison to their rival. Also, Naruto wasn\u2019t just the next reincarnation, he was the reincarnation that got it right and was able to resolve and break the cycle of conflict which was the main point, not just having power. This was his way of choosing his own destiny which was referenced in part 1 when he faced Neji (idk if kishimoto thought that far ahead but it makes sense) If it had been Naruto\u2019s way from the jump, he would resolve every issue through talk no jutsu which isn\u2019t pragmatic.\n\nFrom the beginning when Naruto was first introduced, his theme was about becoming Hokage by never giving up and never going back on his words (no mention of solely working hard even though there are flashes of it with him learning shadow clone, the rasengan, rasenshuriken, sage mode, and partially mastering the nine tails chakra with the help of killer bee and his mom). If you\u2019re looking for a character solely based on hard work then Rock lee is right there or even Sakura.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I disliked all the reincarnation stuff and believe the story of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s rivalry/bond could\u2019ve been told without it. But don\u2019t disregard the fact that Naruto was a reincarnate of someone who despite having immense power, still had to work hard and wasn\u2019t as gifted or quick a learner in comparison to their rival. Also, Naruto wasn\u2019t just the next reincarnation, he was the reincarnation that got it right and was able to resolve and break the cycle of conflict which was the main point, not just having power. This was his way of choosing his own destiny which was referenced in part 1 when he faced Neji (idk if kishimoto thought that far ahead but it makes sense) If it had been Naruto\u2019s way from the jump, he would resolve every issue through talk no jutsu which isn\u2019t pragmatic.\n\nFrom the beginning when Naruto was first introduced, his theme was about becoming Hokage by never giving up and never going back on his words (no mention of solely working hard even though there are flashes of it with him learning shadow clone, the rasengan, rasenshuriken, sage mode, and partially mastering the nine tails chakra with the help of killer bee and his mom). If you\u2019re looking for a character solely based on hard work then Rock lee is right there or even Sakura.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I disliked all the reincarnation stuff and believe the story of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s rivalry/bond could\u2019ve been told without it. But don\u2019t disregard the fact that Naruto was a reincarnate of someone who despite having immense power, still had to work hard and wasn\u2019t as gifted or quick a learner in comparison to their rival. Also, Naruto wasn\u2019t just the next reincarnation, he was the reincarnation that got it right and was able to resolve and break the cycle of conflict which was the main point, not just having power. This was his way of choosing his own destiny which was referenced in part 1 when he faced Neji (idk if kishimoto thought that far ahead but it makes sense) If it had been Naruto\u2019s way from the jump, he would resolve every issue through talk no jutsu which isn\u2019t pragmatic.\n\nFrom the beginning when Naruto was first introduced, his theme was about becoming Hokage by never giving up and never going back on his words (no mention of solely working hard even though there are flashes of it with him learning shadow clone, the rasengan, rasenshuriken, sage mode, and partially mastering the nine tails chakra with the help of killer bee and his mom). If you\u2019re looking for a character solely based on hard work then Rock lee is right there or even Sakura.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I disliked all the reincarnation stuff and believe the story of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s rivalry/bond could\u2019ve been told without it. But don\u2019t disregard the fact that Naruto was a reincarnate of someone who despite having immense power, still had to work hard and wasn\u2019t as gifted or quick a learner in comparison to their rival. Also, Naruto wasn\u2019t just the next reincarnation, he was the reincarnation that got it right and was able to resolve and break the cycle of conflict which was the main point, not just having power. This was his way of choosing his own destiny which was referenced in part 1 when he faced Neji (idk if kishimoto thought that far ahead but it makes sense) If it had been Naruto\u2019s way from the jump, he would resolve every issue through talk no jutsu which isn\u2019t pragmatic.\n\nFrom the beginning when Naruto was first introduced, his theme was about becoming Hokage by never giving up and never going back on his words (no mention of solely working hard even though there are flashes of it with him learning shadow clone, the rasengan, rasenshuriken, sage mode, and partially mastering the nine tails chakra with the help of killer bee and his mom). If you\u2019re looking for a character solely based on hard work then Rock lee is right there or even Sakura.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I disliked all the reincarnation stuff and believe the story of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s rivalry/bond could\u2019ve been told without it. But don\u2019t disregard the fact that Naruto was a reincarnate of someone who despite having immense power, still had to work hard and wasn\u2019t as gifted or quick a learner in comparison to their rival. Also, Naruto wasn\u2019t just the next reincarnation, he was the reincarnation that got it right and was able to resolve and break the cycle of conflict which was the main point, not just having power. This was his way of choosing his own destiny which was referenced in part 1 when he faced Neji (idk if kishimoto thought that far ahead but it makes sense) If it had been Naruto\u2019s way from the jump, he would resolve every issue through talk no jutsu which isn\u2019t pragmatic.\n\nFrom the beginning when Naruto was first introduced, his theme was about becoming Hokage by never giving up and never going back on his words (no mention of solely working hard even though there are flashes of it with him learning shadow clone, the rasengan, rasenshuriken, sage mode, and partially mastering the nine tails chakra with the help of killer bee and his mom). If you\u2019re looking for a character solely based on hard work then Rock lee is right there or even Sakura.",
