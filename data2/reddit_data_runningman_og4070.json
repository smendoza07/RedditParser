He knew he wasn't going to be able to charm her--that's not his character or their relationship, especially with other people like Joong Ki around. So he went for comedy and pretended to be her significant other, upset with her for drinking again. \n\nSame with the heart rate game on a subway car when he accused her of drinking instead of trying to woo her. \n\nFramer Kwang Soo was so much fun.",

Another thing is for her to promote her upcoming drama.\n\nI honestly don't mind people shipping,this include kwangsoo fan saying 'Photo taken by kwangsoo' at every Sunbin photo.\n\nStop it guys.It irritating for me to see fans commenting without seeing what the actual post is about.Stop saying to sunbin when is she going to be married.",
