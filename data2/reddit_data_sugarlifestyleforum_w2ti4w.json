    "body": "The thread yesterday about \u201ctoo many 4\u2019s\u201d and now the one this morning about a guy not necessarily being attracted to woman of a certain race really hit this point home.\n\nIt seems to be just fine for the SBs to complain about fat, ugly old men (btw some of us know our attraction limitations and it\u2019s literally why we pay for relationships) yet if a guyDARES says he doesn\u2019t like older or bigger women you get 20 responses chastising him.\n\nThis is frustrating. We all have our types, and especially in a situation where we are providing financial assistance we have every right to be more picky or narrow in our search. Me saying I don\u2019t want a larger SB isn\u2019t fat shaming. Me saying I don\u2019t want an SB over 30 isn\u2019t ageism. If I don\u2019t want an Indian SB, just as an example, I\u2019m not racist.\n\nThis is tiresome, and honestly I don\u2019t care who is in the bowl or why. I also hope everyone finds success, but stop trying to gaslight us for having fucking preferences.",

The first [hit](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/575352051/least-desirable-how-racial-discrimination-plays-out-in-online-dating) explains that  dating preferences that feel racist to others are not really racist.\n\nMelissa Hobley, OkCupid's chief marketing officer, says the site has learned from social scientists about other reasons that people's dating preferences come off as racist, including the fact that they often reflect IRL \u2014 in real life \u2014 norms.  \nHere's a quote:  \n\\[When it comes to attraction,\\] familiarity is a really big piece,\" Hobley says. \"So people tend to be often attracted to the people that they are familiar with. And in a segregated society, that can be harder in certain areas than in others.\"\n\nThere is one other factor that many women take an offense to when mentioned  - attractiveness. I don't think that any of the black women mentioned [here](https://www.themodelskit.co.uk/blog/the-15-biggest-black-fashion-models-in-the-world/) had  any problems finding suitors, be it vanilla or sugar, because of their attractiveness.\n\nHowever, any guy mentioning attractiveness [will be immediately accused of degrading women](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/vznuj8/comment/igo3yf6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (this actually is a pattern. Perhaps one day I'll find time to start a discussion on that subject).",

And you wonder why women get defensive and retaliate the same types of insults? \n\nIf I say I don\u2019t want an old, fat SD, I\u2019m not directly calling out YOU. The post yesterday was clearly in reference to specific users of this sub who had recently posted their profile reviews asking for help. \n\nAlso, women in society at large experience FAR more criticism and scrutiny over their looks than men. So we really need to stop the whole \u201cwell women say this about men too!\u201d It\u2019s not right, but it not the fucking same. It\u2019s like implying that white people experience the same prejudice that POC do. \nYou guys hold more power in society based on your gender and money. In many cases, women\u2019s power in society is directly impacted by their physical appearance. So for a man to make a post complaining about \u201c4\u2019s\u201d asking for help on a profile review (when that is literally partially the point of this sub) is disgusting and is just not comparable to the examples you listed. \n\nWe all need to hold each other accountable to acceptable behaviour on this sub and in real life.",

                    "body": "For those who think it\u2019s okay to voice your racial dating preferences, consider this: why is it that you prefer some races over others? What is it about the races that you *dont* prefer that makes them less desirable to you? If it\u2019s a physical quality, are you aware that no physical quality is unique to any certain race? For example: light skin, pillowy lips, and upturned eyes are all features that can be found in any race. Race *by definition* is a social construct that has had horrific *social* implications for some rather than others. Namely, the made up definition of race has had negative implications for every race except white. So is it really an entire RACE of people that you are not attracted to, or is it a collection of physical features that YOU attribute to a certain race based on your biases? If you are attracted to big lips on Angelina Jolie but not on black women, newsflash!! you are racist. If you don\u2019t prefer big lips on women AT ALL then just say that! Why do you need to mention race at all since big lips are a feature (just like all physical features) that can be found in any race? \n\nRaces have more biological variety *within* them than they do *between* them. So stating that your physical preferences don\u2019t align with an entire race of people is 1. Factually incorrect as it pertains to the way that race operates socially and biologically and 2. Further perpetuates racial stereotypes that marginalize racial minorities.\n\nSo to sum that all up, some of ya\u2019ll really need to dig out your old human biology and philosophy text books and do some reviewing. Or maybe just listen to women of colour and acknowledge that we all have biases and the first step to abolishing racism is to acknowledge and explore our own biases. \n\nNo one said you are wrong for having preferences. However, you are wrong for attributing your physical preferences to an entire race of people which those preferences are not entirely applicable to.",

If we didn't, we'd all be chasing the same people, and most of us would be sorely disappointed. \n\nIt is easy for me to say I prefer women who are tall, slim, intelligent, funny and athletic.\n\nBut what is tall for me (I'm 6'4\" so my 'tall' might be much taller than a SD who is 5'4\"), what is slim, intelligent, funny, athletic to me vs. you? And who gives a shit if you don't like that I think tall (even in a woman) only means 6' and above. If I'm a lonely guy because I choose to only date to my specific preference, then so be it, I'm the only one who is hurting because of that.\n\nBut, generalizing a race based on an attribute or a thought is racism. As an example, if I said I will never date an Asian because they just aren't tall enough, I am generalizing that all Asians are shorter than 6ft, which is racism (and also a wrong fact).\n\nAnyway, embrace your preferences, they make you who you are. Just realize they are preferences and not rules you must live by or be shamed by others. You'd be surprised how many people I've dated (sugar or otherwise) who hasn't met my preferences exactly, and they have been great!",

When said opinion of the SD is responded to by a woman, pointing out why they disagree suddenly the SD is being attacked and cries he is being made to feel badly for what he likes. When it\u2019s flipped that same SD has no issues telling women harsh truths and just expect them to say \u201c Ok you\u2019re right \u201c. If women feel attacked or are made to feel badly , it\u2019s fine. If she expresses how she feels you all jump on her like a pack of wild\ndogs. How dare she be upset by the SD and his profound truths about her. \n\nDo any SD\u2019s ever stop to think that maybe you don\u2019t do well in vanilla dating because of your attitudes toward women ? No, because men never think they are the problem. You want to blame it on women not being attracted to you so in sugar dating , it\u2019s like you are seeking revenge . I\u2019ve dated men I didn\u2019t find physically attractive because they treated me with respect and that made them become physically attractive. Not saying SD\u2019s should do\nthat in sugar dating just pointing out how that argument from SD\u2019s is often fruitless\nas many women will date for more than looks or money in the vanilla world. \n\nNo one is mad at SD\u2019s for being picky but like I said, so many of your attitudes toward women in general are disgusting. When you find a woman unattractive and she has a reaction, you act like she shouldn\u2019t be upset and take it like a champ.",

They've had smoke blown up their butts since puberty about how gorgeous they are, so they enter the Bowl expecting things to be a lock. Rejection is new and uncomfortable and they absolutely take it personally. A California blonde who was in beauty pagents will totally get discouraged if she keeps getting passed over for guys who want to sugar an Indian chick, for example.

You're getting pissy over people \"not being able to state preferences\" when really what y'all want to do is gripe about folks just existing in your vicinity. \n\nSome asshole complaining in an insulting way about SA being filled with \"too many 4s\" that he could easily ignore, is pretty different than respectfully telling someone \"hey, you aren't the type I'm looking for, but I wish you the best!\" As others have pointed out, tastes aren't universal. Plus, sometimes people who are less conventionally attractive are eclectic conversationalists and lovely dancers or something.\n\nA SD is more likely to be called a pig if they say \"Get out of my face, you four!\" instead of just turning someone down gently. Obviously. And btw I also think women should turn people down gently whenever possible. Obviously.",

He could be without limps, wear a diaper, and sound like Patchy the Pirate, but if he's respectful and can afford my ppm with no problems, I'm happy.\n\n***\"It seems to be just fine for the SBs to complain about fat, ugly old men (btw some of us know our attraction limitations and it\u2019s literally why we pay for relationships) yet if a guyDARES says he doesn\u2019t like older or bigger women you get 20 responses chastising him.\"***\n\nI may never make 6 figures, but I use what I got to make sure I'm not repulsive in my hygiene and looks. It makes no sense that some of the SDs who make 6,7,8 figures or more are out here not being hygienic and walking around here with no gym memberships, not getting regularly tested and not eating healthy. \n\n ***We all have our types, and especially in a situation where we are providing financial assistance we have every right to be more picky or narrow in our search.***\n\nI've conversed with POT SDs who complained about not finding the \"right\" sugar baby, but refuse to date Black women or other POC.

There are very few women who have any trouble getting men to be interested in them sexually in vanilla dating. The most unattractive women can easily get laid using dating apps.\n\nIt doesn't translate to sugar. Even attractive women in vanilla settings don't quite understand that they need to be more than that to earn an allowance.\n\nIn the end the point is always gonna be the same though. You can't possibly maintain a profile review system if you make it a \"rate me on my looks\" system. It's already difficult enough to put yourself out there for others to see, let alone it others can freely rate you. \n\nPeople will inevitably understand the hint or find ways to justify their lack of success. The conflict will add nothing to the sub.",

This is why this post has 150+ emotionally-charged comments on it.\n\n> I don\u2019t date black girls because of their skin tone is RACIST\n\nI don't fully agree with this. Being _attracted_ to a skin tone is a personal, largely unconscious choice. I'm not generally attracted to the pasty-white, translucent skin tone, but I'm far from racist against the 25% northern-European roots I have. Conversely, I've also seen gorgeous ebony tones that I can appreciate, but doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with the owner.\n\nAs long as someone is not completely disregarding their existence, lobbying to limit their rights and freedoms, or portraying all people who look like them as inherently and irredeemably \"ugly\" (which I understand happens on a greater social level, but that's _not_ what anyone here is doing on an individual level), it's egregiously wrong to try to paint people as racists.\n\nYou cannot legislate or otherwise force someone to be attracted to someone else, full-stop.",

The issue is the why behind it. \n\nIf I\u2019m not attracted to black men because I think they\u2019re all thugs and drug dealers, that\u2019s racist. \n\nIf I typically don\u2019t date black men because I haven\u2019t met one yet that I was attracted to, but I\u2019m open to dating them, then that\u2019s not racist. \n\nBreaking down why you\u2019re not attracted to someone is where the racism truly is. Not in the attraction itself. \n\nSimilarly, if you don\u2019t date Indian women because they wear bindis and that\u2019s weird to you or because they operate in the world differently from you, that\u2019s racist. \n\nIf you simply haven\u2019t met an Indian woman that checks all your boxes but you\u2019d be open to dating them, that\u2019s not racist. \n\nSimilarly, dating an Asian woman, Indian woman, black woman, etc because they\u2019re different and \u201cexotic\u201d is also racist because you\u2019re ignoring the human being entirely and focusing on the skin color that they have been marginalized for and killed over for hundreds of years. \n\nIt\u2019s not the same with height because you\u2019ve only been rejected by a woman because of your height, not hunted down, enslaved, and killed over it. \n\nDismantling this with a lot of internal reflection is how you understand what\u2019s going on. No one is saying that you have to be attracted to everyone. But being aware of your own biases when it comes to dating as a white man, especially POC, is important. \n\nPOC experience the world VERY differently, especially in America, compared to a white man. True internal reflection is difficult for most people because a lot of them would lose their fucking minds, but that\u2019s not an excuse to not do the work. It\u2019s important to really listen and reflect.\n\nETA: being intentionally inflammatory or obtuse to make a point or get the answer you want to hear reflects badly on you and shows you can\u2019t have a discussion in good faith. When people make certain points, of course there\u2019s lots of nuance. They have likely considered the argument they are making and also considered the counter-arguments very carefully, so when you say things like \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a certain race attractive, you have to force yourself to date them?\u201d You look extra stupid.",

I don't see what attraction has to do with that at all. I am personally not attracted to redheaded women with pale skin and lots of freckles. That does not mean I think I am superior to them or that other types of women are superior to them.\n\nAs for \"internal reflection\" and \"doing the work\" I will just say what I said in another similar reply. This white guilt savior complex really does more harm than it does good. Some people see racism and racists under every nook and cranny of life and where they don't see it, they INVENT it! It is really condescending to assume POC are so fragile that they need people like you as their self-anointed champions and defenders to seek out every tiny example of potential racism they can find and broadcast it far and wide.\n\nYes, we still have problems to fix as a society. Do you know what DOESN'T help though? Telling POC that you see racism and racists everywhere and how we are a hopelessly irredeemably racist country. How hopeful and optimistic do you think that makes people for their future? They don't need people like you to police obscure subreddits for the slightest potential example of racism. All you are really doing is creating more division and giving REAL legacy racism cover by way of all the noise and nonsense that gets associated with that word, which has made it nearly meaningless and undefinable.",

I\u2019m not here to force upon anyone\u2019s beliefs or preferences. But to categorize an entire certain race as unattractive is just beyond me. It is something that people are born with. You cannot change your race. And when one categorizes a certain race as unattractive, it is extremely heartbreaking and hurtful. \n\nLong story short, it particularly hurt me because my SD and I have been dating for a year. I love him and it was hurtful to hear that from someone I have grown to love and care about. No one should be making such comments toward eachother in a loving SR. He has since then apologized and I said I needed to take time to think.",

It's what happens when a group reaches the cult stage, and a sort of collective narcissism takes over.

Men will always be attracted to young, with a fit body, and whatever their racial preference might be.\n\nHere are my preferences for SB's. I don't care what anyone thinks, and these are never going to change:\n\n\\- no one over 30\n\n\\- no one overweight\n\n\\- no tats, no piercings (other than ear piercing)\n\n\\- no white women (I'm white, and only prefer ethnic women)\n\nI don't begrudge any women who don't prefer me. For example, I was a skinny white guy. When women said I was too skinny, I didn't whine about it, I lifted weights and put on some muscle. I don't get the \"skinny\" complaint anymore.\n\nIf there are other attributes about myself that I *can't* change, I don't whine about it, I move on to other women who don't care about that attribute.\n\na/k/a Life Skills 101",

To the extent that you think systemic racism is a problem, you should see it as even more built-in, which in turn absolves a lot of people for their behaviors and thoughts.  I don\u2019t know why the woke left doesn\u2019t see it this way as I think it\u2019s a consequence of the ideology. My guess is that it\u2019s because they\u2019re in a fighting mindset.\n\nSome people get gold stars in some cases for overcoming aspects of racism but it\u2019s bizarre to have some gold star system for twisting your sexual preferences to be more progressive.  Noone should be attacked or rewarded in this case.  So I don\u2019t think ones preferences are a subject of moral evaluation even though they\u2019re bad - and the desire to slip into such moral evaluation is a consequence of not fully internalizing what systemic phenomena are.  Not judging people on this is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve.  But it\u2019s not terribly hard to manage once certain arguments are in place\n\nYes these preferences are bad and are evidence of systemic racism - they hurt people by limiting the choices of those who hold them and limiting the approval and choices of those on the other side.  Bad social shit based precisely on race is racism to me, so thats why Im comfortable with using it.  Racism is sensitive, and thats why people should keep this stuff to whispers among friends or in places to intensely discuss this stuff with tons of considerations in place.  An SLF thread cohld be that place but it depends on how the conversation develops. Casually Tossing it out in front of hundreds or thousands of people somewhat off-topic on this thread just isn\u2019t the time.  In fact I think it\u2019s bad to play it loose here because we\u2019re constantly getting girls on here posting and doubting their attractiveness to guys based on their race.  I mean we gotta tell them it narrows the pool but that\u2019s an extremely rough conversation so it pays to use care in the dialogue.",

I\u2019ve been told I look Brazilian / Guyanese , it\u2019s become more of research than anything lol Also have to take in account most of these men are in fact married so they want someone that could seem as a son / or daughter esp if they are looking local . Also the push of wanting Masculine men when they themselves are eh ,not , comes from again the fact most of these men are married so if you don\u2019t fit the bill they need to remain DL it\u2019s a no. Also the ones that\u2019s just are lonely and wasting time is crazy. But alas it still reverts to race. As for me I\u2019m 5\u201911 or taller ,145lbs and very vascular . I\u2019ve concluded these men really don\u2019t want anything , it\u2019s a bunch of guys paying to look for men they wish they could look like in their heydays and who they can easily hide their sexuality with. Even with the Black men I\u2019ve encountered they only want white . Had one black guy tell me I\u2019d never have success here as black isn\u2019t desirable lol and a year later he\u2019s still on their and again it\u2019s just the same faces .",

From the nasty prostitute in the streets to strippers to porn stars. As a Black female looking for a SD. I am an 8. I am curvy I am in my early 30s, very pretty and I get a minimal amount of messages. Thats why I got off these sugaring sites. I got off the vanilla sites too. White is right and being slender is king. I feel as though racial preferences is no different than racial bias. All driven by the foundations of racism. I feel as though people don't look at the beauty of other cultures as anything special because this country is indoctrinated to feel that way. I see sexiness in all colors and features. But you can't change how society thinks so it isn't even worth complaining about. Most of these preference dudes wouldn't befriend you anyway because they are uncomfortable with different cultures due to being raised in a racist society. If dude dont hang around any Blacks (even if he is Black himself) dont expect him to be into you - not even as friends. I think weight is most stupid of them all. If the girl has a drop dead gorgeous face, a real SD would just pay for the liposuction to be done unless they really not balling. Most of the guys are overweight themselves and got fupas. Weight is so changeable. But being colored isn't. This is why Sammy Sosa and the rest bleached their skin- he wanted to be seen as preferrable. Y'all not pigs- yall just another victim of societal indoctrination of standards. Not yall fault society taught yall what colors and shapes to get hard too. Dick is a dick in my hand regardless of color- but I am effected too by society standards- 8 inches or more is what I desire even though 4 to 6 inches is comfortable for me (got a small hole).",

The first [hit](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/575352051/least-desirable-how-racial-discrimination-plays-out-in-online-dating) explains that  dating preferences that feel racist to others are not really racist.\n\nMelissa Hobley, OkCupid's chief marketing officer, says the site has learned from social scientists about other reasons that people's dating preferences come off as racist, including the fact that they often reflect IRL \u2014 in real life \u2014 norms.  \nHere's a quote:  \n\\[When it comes to attraction,\\] familiarity is a really big piece,\" Hobley says. \"So people tend to be often attracted to the people that they are familiar with. And in a segregated society, that can be harder in certain areas than in others.\"\n\nThere is one other factor that many women take an offense to when mentioned  - attractiveness. I don't think that any of the black women mentioned [here](https://www.themodelskit.co.uk/blog/the-15-biggest-black-fashion-models-in-the-world/) had  any problems finding suitors, be it vanilla or sugar, because of their attractiveness.\n\nHowever, any guy mentioning attractiveness [will be immediately accused of degrading women](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/vznuj8/comment/igo3yf6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (this actually is a pattern. Perhaps one day I'll find time to start a discussion on that subject).",

What is it about the races that you *dont* prefer that makes them less desirable to you? If it\u2019s a physical quality, are you aware that no physical quality is unique to any certain race? For example: light skin, pillowy lips, and upturned eyes are all features that can be found in any race. Race *by definition* is a social construct that has had horrific *social* implications for some rather than others. Namely, the made up definition of race has had negative implications for every race except white. So is it really an entire RACE of people that you are not attracted to, or is it a collection of physical features that YOU attribute to a certain race based on your biases? If you are attracted to big lips on Angelina Jolie but not on black women, newsflash!! you are racist. If you don\u2019t prefer big lips on women AT ALL then just say that! Why do you need to mention race at all since big lips are a feature (just like all physical features) that can be found in any race? \n\nRaces have more biological variety *within* them than they do *between* them. So stating that your physical preferences don\u2019t align with an entire race of people is 1. Factually incorrect as it pertains to the way that race operates socially and biologically and 2. Further perpetuates racial stereotypes that marginalize racial minorities.\n\nSo to sum that all up, some of ya\u2019ll really need to dig out your old human biology and philosophy text books and do some reviewing. Or maybe just listen to women of colour and acknowledge that we all have biases and the first step to abolishing racism is to acknowledge and explore our own biases. \n\nNo one said you are wrong for having preferences. However, you are wrong for attributing your physical preferences to an entire race of people which those preferences are not entirely applicable to.",

They've had smoke blown up their butts since puberty about how gorgeous they are, so they enter the Bowl expecting things to be a lock. Rejection is new and uncomfortable and they absolutely take it personally. A California blonde who was in beauty pagents will totally get discouraged if she keeps getting passed over for guys who want to sugar an Indian chick, for example.

Not trying to get into a debate on it (it's just the one item that is genuinely called out).  But I'm talking the people that ONLY go after women of that age.  It's different to be open to even, women in the 18-23 range, vs. ONLY going after women still in highschool.  \n\nBut again - that wasn't the main point of my post.  I've expressed plenty of preferences - (including on body type), and never had an issue.",

There are very few women who have any trouble getting men to be interested in them sexually in vanilla dating. The most unattractive women can easily get laid using dating apps.\n\nIt doesn't translate to sugar. Even attractive women in vanilla settings don't quite understand that they need to be more than that to earn an allowance.\n\nIn the end the point is always gonna be the same though. You can't possibly maintain a profile review system if you make it a \"rate me on my looks\" system. It's already difficult enough to put yourself out there for others to see, let alone it others can freely rate you. \n\nPeople will inevitably understand the hint or find ways to justify their lack of success. The conflict will add nothing to the sub.",

Being _attracted_ to a skin tone is a personal, largely unconscious choice. I'm not generally attracted to the pasty-white, translucent skin tone, but I'm far from racist against the 25% northern-European roots I have. Conversely, I've also seen gorgeous ebony tones that I can appreciate, but doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with the owner.\n\nAs long as someone is not completely disregarding their existence, lobbying to limit their rights and freedoms, or portraying all people who look like them as inherently and irredeemably \"ugly\" (which I understand happens on a greater social level, but that's _not_ what anyone here is doing on an individual level), it's egregiously wrong to try to paint people as racists.\n\nYou cannot legislate or otherwise force someone to be attracted to someone else, full-stop.",

Not in the attraction itself. \n\nSimilarly, if you don\u2019t date Indian women because they wear bindis and that\u2019s weird to you or because they operate in the world differently from you, that\u2019s racist. \n\nIf you simply haven\u2019t met an Indian woman that checks all your boxes but you\u2019d be open to dating them, that\u2019s not racist. \n\nSimilarly, dating an Asian woman, Indian woman, black woman, etc because they\u2019re different and \u201cexotic\u201d is also racist because you\u2019re ignoring the human being entirely and focusing on the skin color that they have been marginalized for and killed over for hundreds of years. \n\nIt\u2019s not the same with height because you\u2019ve only been rejected by a woman because of your height, not hunted down, enslaved, and killed over it. \n\nDismantling this with a lot of internal reflection is how you understand what\u2019s going on. No one is saying that you have to be attracted to everyone. But being aware of your own biases when it comes to dating as a white man, especially POC, is important. \n\nPOC experience the world VERY differently, especially in America, compared to a white man. True internal reflection is difficult for most people because a lot of them would lose their fucking minds, but that\u2019s not an excuse to not do the work. It\u2019s important to really listen and reflect.\n\nETA: being intentionally inflammatory or obtuse to make a point or get the answer you want to hear reflects badly on you and shows you can\u2019t have a discussion in good faith. When people make certain points, of course there\u2019s lots of nuance. They have likely considered the argument they are making and also considered the counter-arguments very carefully, so when you say things like \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a certain race attractive, you have to force yourself to date them?\u201d You look extra stupid.",

I don't see what attraction has to do with that at all. I am personally not attracted to redheaded women with pale skin and lots of freckles. That does not mean I think I am superior to them or that other types of women are superior to them.\n\nAs for \"internal reflection\" and \"doing the work\" I will just say what I said in another similar reply. This white guilt savior complex really does more harm than it does good. Some people see racism and racists under every nook and cranny of life and where they don't see it, they INVENT it! It is really condescending to assume POC are so fragile that they need people like you as their self-anointed champions and defenders to seek out every tiny example of potential racism they can find and broadcast it far and wide.\n\nYes, we still have problems to fix as a society. Do you know what DOESN'T help though? Telling POC that you see racism and racists everywhere and how we are a hopelessly irredeemably racist country. How hopeful and optimistic do you think that makes people for their future? They don't need people like you to police obscure subreddits for the slightest potential example of racism. All you are really doing is creating more division and giving REAL legacy racism cover by way of all the noise and nonsense that gets associated with that word, which has made it nearly meaningless and undefinable.",

Is it reasonable to shame someone for eating meat in a society where everyone eats meat?  No - and furthermore that\u2019s a case unlike racial preference where someone is both doing something deliberately and it may be an extreme moral wrong.  If it turns out that animals suffer as much as humans it\u2019s a holocaust.  So something can be horribly, horribly wrong, but it\u2019s still no reason to shame someone.\n\nYou have to distinguish between reasons to shame someone (or yourself) and reasons to feel uncomfortable that your thoughts line up with some really ugly social forces.  Not asking anyone to beat themselves up.  But recognition of that ugliness should make you reluctant to speak on it in a lot of circumstances and use tons of care when you do.  There aren\u2019t many big asks here - any person will have tons of room to discuss these things candidly but they have to use varying levels of care depending on the context.",

I guess we are all perpetuating racism by doing things as innocuous as wanting to meet the people we are the most physically attracted to?\n\nYou cannot shame or guilt people into attraction and it's really not fair to cast aspersions upon them for whom they are attracted to and whom they are not.\n\nTo go back to your analogy, do you know what else hurts POC? Thinking that they are so fragile and need to be protected from every little potential offense buy other people such as yourself who cast yourselves in the role of their saviors or champions which is frankly just condescending and self-serving, virtue signaling even if your intentions are pure, which I believe they are.\n\nWhat hurts POC is seeking out racism under every nook and cranny whether it is there or not and broadcasting it far and wide.

To the extent that you think systemic racism is a problem, you should see it as even more built-in, which in turn absolves a lot of people for their behaviors and thoughts.  I don\u2019t know why the woke left doesn\u2019t see it this way as I think it\u2019s a consequence of the ideology. My guess is that it\u2019s because they\u2019re in a fighting mindset.\n\nSome people get gold stars in some cases for overcoming aspects of racism but it\u2019s bizarre to have some gold star system for twisting your sexual preferences to be more progressive.  Noone should be attacked or rewarded in this case.  So I don\u2019t think ones preferences are a subject of moral evaluation even though they\u2019re bad - and the desire to slip into such moral evaluation is a consequence of not fully internalizing what systemic phenomena are.  Not judging people on this is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve.  But it\u2019s not terribly hard to manage once certain arguments are in place\n\nYes these preferences are bad and are evidence of systemic racism - they hurt people by limiting the choices of those who hold them and limiting the approval and choices of those on the other side.  Bad social shit based precisely on race is racism to me, so thats why Im comfortable with using it.  Racism is sensitive, and thats why people should keep this stuff to whispers among friends or in places to intensely discuss this stuff with tons of considerations in place.  An SLF thread cohld be that place but it depends on how the conversation develops. Casually Tossing it out in front of hundreds or thousands of people somewhat off-topic on this thread just isn\u2019t the time.  In fact I think it\u2019s bad to play it loose here because we\u2019re constantly getting girls on here posting and doubting their attractiveness to guys based on their race.  I mean we gotta tell them it narrows the pool but that\u2019s an extremely rough conversation so it pays to use care in the dialogue.",

The first [hit](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/575352051/least-desirable-how-racial-discrimination-plays-out-in-online-dating) explains that  dating preferences that feel racist to others are not really racist.\n\nMelissa Hobley, OkCupid's chief marketing officer, says the site has learned from social scientists about other reasons that people's dating preferences come off as racist, including the fact that they often reflect IRL \u2014 in real life \u2014 norms.  \nHere's a quote:  \n\\[When it comes to attraction,\\] familiarity is a really big piece,\" Hobley says. \"So people tend to be often attracted to the people that they are familiar with. And in a segregated society, that can be harder in certain areas than in others.\"\n\nThere is one other factor that many women take an offense to when mentioned  - attractiveness. I don't think that any of the black women mentioned [here](https://www.themodelskit.co.uk/blog/the-15-biggest-black-fashion-models-in-the-world/) had  any problems finding suitors, be it vanilla or sugar, because of their attractiveness.\n\nHowever, any guy mentioning attractiveness [will be immediately accused of degrading women](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/vznuj8/comment/igo3yf6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (this actually is a pattern.

Being _attracted_ to a skin tone is a personal, largely unconscious choice. I'm not generally attracted to the pasty-white, translucent skin tone, but I'm far from racist against the 25% northern-European roots I have. Conversely, I've also seen gorgeous ebony tones that I can appreciate, but doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with the owner.\n\nAs long as someone is not completely disregarding their existence, lobbying to limit their rights and freedoms, or portraying all people who look like them as inherently and irredeemably \"ugly\" (which I understand happens on a greater social level, but that's _not_ what anyone here is doing on an individual level), it's egregiously wrong to try to paint people as racists.\n\nYou cannot legislate or otherwise force someone to be attracted to someone else, full-stop.",

The issue is the why behind it. \n\nIf I\u2019m not attracted to black men because I think they\u2019re all thugs and drug dealers, that\u2019s racist. \n\nIf I typically don\u2019t date black men because I haven\u2019t met one yet that I was attracted to, but I\u2019m open to dating them, then that\u2019s not racist. \n\nBreaking down why you\u2019re not attracted to someone is where the racism truly is. Not in the attraction itself. \n\nSimilarly, if you don\u2019t date Indian women because they wear bindis and that\u2019s weird to you or because they operate in the world differently from you, that\u2019s racist. \n\nIf you simply haven\u2019t met an Indian woman that checks all your boxes but you\u2019d be open to dating them, that\u2019s not racist. \n\nSimilarly, dating an Asian woman, Indian woman, black woman, etc because they\u2019re different and \u201cexotic\u201d is also racist because you\u2019re ignoring the human being entirely and focusing on the skin color that they have been marginalized for and killed over for hundreds of years. \n\nIt\u2019s not the same with height because you\u2019ve only been rejected by a woman because of your height, not hunted down, enslaved, and killed over it. \n\nDismantling this with a lot of internal reflection is how you understand what\u2019s going on. No one is saying that you have to be attracted to everyone. But being aware of your own biases when it comes to dating as a white man, especially POC, is important. \n\nPOC experience the world VERY differently, especially in America, compared to a white man. True internal reflection is difficult for most people because a lot of them would lose their fucking minds, but that\u2019s not an excuse to not do the work. It\u2019s important to really listen and reflect.\n\nETA: being intentionally inflammatory or obtuse to make a point or get the answer you want to hear reflects badly on you and shows you can\u2019t have a discussion in good faith. When people make certain points, of course there\u2019s lots of nuance. They have likely considered the argument they are making and also considered the counter-arguments very carefully, so when you say things like \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a certain race attractive, you have to force yourself to date them?\u201d You look extra stupid.",

I don't see what attraction has to do with that at all. I am personally not attracted to redheaded women with pale skin and lots of freckles. That does not mean I think I am superior to them or that other types of women are superior to them.\n\nAs for \"internal reflection\" and \"doing the work\" I will just say what I said in another similar reply. This white guilt savior complex really does more harm than it does good. Some people see racism and racists under every nook and cranny of life and where they don't see it, they INVENT it! It is really condescending to assume POC are so fragile that they need people like you as their self-anointed champions and defenders to seek out every tiny example of potential racism they can find and broadcast it far and wide.\n\nYes, we still have problems to fix as a society. Do you know what DOESN'T help though? Telling POC that you see racism and racists everywhere and how we are a hopelessly irredeemably racist country. How hopeful and optimistic do you think that makes people for their future? They don't need people like you to police obscure subreddits for the slightest potential example of racism. All you are really doing is creating more division and giving REAL legacy racism cover by way of all the noise and nonsense that gets associated with that word, which has made it nearly meaningless and undefinable.",

(This was something that I was unaware of, at that time.)\nHe informed me that he had made it a point, IN HIS OWN HEAD, that he would continue only viewing me as his boss, and nothing more.

Not asking anyone to beat themselves up.  But recognition of that ugliness should make you reluctant to speak on it in a lot of circumstances and use tons of care when you do.

To the extent that you think systemic racism is a problem, you should see it as even more built-in, which in turn absolves a lot of people for their behaviors and thoughts.  I don\u2019t know why the woke left doesn\u2019t see it this way as I think it\u2019s a consequence of the ideology. My guess is that it\u2019s because they\u2019re in a fighting mindset.\n\nSome people get gold stars in some cases for overcoming aspects of racism but it\u2019s bizarre to have some gold star system for twisting your sexual preferences to be more progressive.  Noone should be attacked or rewarded in this case.  So I don\u2019t think ones preferences are a subject of moral evaluation even though they\u2019re bad - and the desire to slip into such moral evaluation is a consequence of not fully internalizing what systemic phenomena are.  Not judging people on this is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve.  But it\u2019s not terribly hard to manage once certain arguments are in place\n\nYes these preferences are bad and are evidence of systemic racism - they hurt people by limiting the choices of those who hold them and limiting the approval and choices of those on the other side.  Bad social shit based precisely on race is racism to me, so thats why Im comfortable with using it.  Racism is sensitive, and thats why people should keep this stuff to whispers among friends or in places to intensely discuss this stuff with tons of considerations in place.  An SLF thread cohld be that place but it depends on how the conversation develops. Casually Tossing it out in front of hundreds or thousands of people somewhat off-topic on this thread just isn\u2019t the time.  In fact I think it\u2019s bad to play it loose here because we\u2019re constantly getting girls on here posting and doubting their attractiveness to guys based on their race.  I mean we gotta tell them it narrows the pool but that\u2019s an extremely rough conversation so it pays to use care in the dialogue.",

The first [hit](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/575352051/least-desirable-how-racial-discrimination-plays-out-in-online-dating) explains that  dating preferences that feel racist to others are not really racist.\n\nMelissa Hobley, OkCupid's chief marketing officer, says the site has learned from social scientists about other reasons that people's dating preferences come off as racist, including the fact that they often reflect IRL \u2014 in real life \u2014 norms.  \nHere's a quote:  \n\\[When it comes to attraction,\\] familiarity is a really big piece,\" Hobley says. \"So people tend to be often attracted to the people that they are familiar with. And in a segregated society, that can be harder in certain areas than in others.\"\n\nThere is one other factor that many women take an offense to when mentioned  - attractiveness. I don't think that any of the black women mentioned [here](https://www.themodelskit.co.uk/blog/the-15-biggest-black-fashion-models-in-the-world/) had  any problems finding suitors, be it vanilla or sugar, because of their attractiveness.\n\nHowever, any guy mentioning attractiveness [will be immediately accused of degrading women](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/vznuj8/comment/igo3yf6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (this actually is a pattern.

There are very few women who have any trouble getting men to be interested in them sexually in vanilla dating. The most unattractive women can easily get laid using dating apps.\n\nIt doesn't translate to sugar. Even attractive women in vanilla settings don't quite understand that they need to be more than that to earn an allowance.\n\nIn the end the point is always gonna be the same though. You can't possibly maintain a profile review system if you make it a \"rate me on my looks\" system. It's already difficult enough to put yourself out there for others to see, let alone it others can freely rate you. \n\nPeople will inevitably understand the hint or find ways to justify their lack of success.

Being _attracted_ to a skin tone is a personal, largely unconscious choice. I'm not generally attracted to the pasty-white, translucent skin tone, but I'm far from racist against the 25% northern-European roots I have. Conversely, I've also seen gorgeous ebony tones that I can appreciate, but doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with the owner.\n\nAs long as someone is not completely disregarding their existence, lobbying to limit their rights and freedoms, or portraying all people who look like them as inherently and irredeemably \"ugly\" (which I understand happens on a greater social level, but that's _not_ what anyone here is doing on an individual level), it's egregiously wrong to try to paint people as racists.\n\nYou cannot legislate or otherwise force someone to be attracted to someone else, full-stop.",

I don't see what attraction has to do with that at all. I am personally not attracted to redheaded women with pale skin and lots of freckles. That does not mean I think I am superior to them or that other types of women are superior to them.\n\nAs for \"internal reflection\" and \"doing the work\" I will just say what I said in another similar reply. This white guilt savior complex really does more harm than it does good. Some people see racism and racists under every nook and cranny of life and where they don't see it, they INVENT it! It is really condescending to assume POC are so fragile that they need people like you as their self-anointed champions and defenders to seek out every tiny example of potential racism they can find and broadcast it far and wide.\n\nYes, we still have problems to fix as a society. Do you know what DOESN'T help though? Telling POC that you see racism and racists everywhere and how we are a hopelessly irredeemably racist country. How hopeful and optimistic do you think that makes people for their future? They don't need people like you to police obscure subreddits for the slightest potential example of racism. All you are really doing is creating more division and giving REAL legacy racism cover by way of all the noise and nonsense that gets associated with that word, which has made it nearly meaningless and undefinable.",

As I said, I'll go with the dictionary, thank you.\n\nPOC are not some monolith who think one thing. My point is that plenty of them are tired of the race baiting and the virtue signaling by self-appointed saviors such as yourself who see racism and racists around every corner.\n\nI submit that people like YOU actually do more harm than good. You muddy the waters when you see racism everywhere that you diminish POC's agency by making them feel it's hopeless to try and prosper in our society.

To me, that's my mind internalizing, yep he's still in my range of \"acceptable dating,\" but that's by my OWN standards, NOT someone else's.\n\nFor example....\nI had a work relationship evolve once, to where one of my junior workers, revealed to me his own \"looks rationality.\"  \nHe told me that he was glad to move to our shop, but that he knew that his best friend (fellow Co worker in the same bldg) had developed feelings for me. (This was something that I was unaware of, at that time.)\nHe informed me that he had made it a point, IN HIS OWN HEAD, that he would continue only viewing me as his boss, and nothing more.  He thought that this was pretty easy to do, considering our job required uniforms, and let's just say that they aren't exactly \"flattering.\"\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude06\nAbout a yr later, we were finishing up a particularly brutal and mentally exhausting case, and everyone in the shop was just wiped the fuck out, so we all went for drinks, to celebrate that shit finnnnnnally being OVER!\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nLet's just say that \"whenever we go out for drinks\ud83d\ude1d\ud83c\udf78\ud83c\udf76\ud83c\udf78\" to celebrate after a case, we usually all get pretty freakin lit, bc it usually meant that that was one \"balls to the walls\" type of case.\nIt was at one of these \"camaraderie meetings,\" that he revealed that he had actually fallen for me too.\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\nHe said he didn't understand it, bc I wasn't \"usually\" the profile of the chicks that he was usually into, but after being with, in, and around me, on a constant basis, he said he began to understand why my former worker, had also become smitten with me.\n\nI don't fit ANY MOLD, or stereotype.\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI'm different, and my personality has ALWAYS been that way!\nI understand and appreciate ppl on all different levels and playing fields.\nI may not be everyone's cup of tea\ud83e\uded6 (got a little bit\ud83e\udd0f\ud83e\udd0f of a bad ass\ud83d\ude08 in me),\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f and Im pretty damn proud of it\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude18), but I'm damn sure, NOT the book that you should judge by the cover either!!!\n\nI think SA is great bc it opens the flood gates for all types to be considered.\n\nTry dating someone who DOESNT fit your \"status quo,\" of typical \"looks;\" yall might surprise yourselves!\ud83d\ude18",

I don\u2019t know why the woke left doesn\u2019t see it this way as I think it\u2019s a consequence of the ideology. My guess is that it\u2019s because they\u2019re in a fighting mindset.\n\nSome people get gold stars in some cases for overcoming aspects of racism but it\u2019s bizarre to have some gold star system for twisting your sexual preferences to be more progressive.  Noone should be attacked or rewarded in this case.  So I don\u2019t think ones preferences are a subject of moral evaluation even though they\u2019re bad - and the desire to slip into such moral evaluation is a consequence of not fully internalizing what systemic phenomena are.  Not judging people on this is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve.  But it\u2019s not terribly hard to manage once certain arguments are in place\n\nYes these preferences are bad and are evidence of systemic racism - they hurt people by limiting the choices of those who hold them and limiting the approval and choices of those on the other side.  Bad social shit based precisely on race is racism to me, so thats why Im comfortable with using it.  Racism is sensitive, and thats why people should keep this stuff to whispers among friends or in places to intensely discuss this stuff with tons of considerations in place.  An SLF thread cohld be that place but it depends on how the conversation develops. Casually Tossing it out in front of hundreds or thousands of people somewhat off-topic on this thread just isn\u2019t the time.  In fact I think it\u2019s bad to play it loose here because we\u2019re constantly getting girls on here posting and doubting their attractiveness to guys based on their race.  I mean we gotta tell them it narrows the pool but that\u2019s an extremely rough conversation so it pays to use care in the dialogue.",

This is why this post has 150+ emotionally-charged comments on it.\n\n> I don\u2019t date black girls because of their skin tone is RACIST\n\nI don't fully agree with this. Being _attracted_ to a skin tone is a personal, largely unconscious choice. I'm not generally attracted to the pasty-white, translucent skin tone, but I'm far from racist against the 25% northern-European roots I have. Conversely, I've also seen gorgeous ebony tones that I can appreciate, but doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with the owner.\n\nAs long as someone is not completely disregarding their existence, lobbying to limit their rights and freedoms, or portraying all people who look like them as inherently and irredeemably \"ugly\" (which I understand happens on a greater social level, but that's _not_ what anyone here is doing on an individual level), it's egregiously wrong to try to paint people as racists.\n\nYou cannot legislate or otherwise force someone to be attracted to someone else, full-stop.",

To the extent that you think systemic racism is a problem, you should see it as even more built-in, which in turn absolves a lot of people for their behaviors and thoughts.  I don\u2019t know why the woke left doesn\u2019t see it this way as I think it\u2019s a consequence of the ideology. My guess is that it\u2019s because they\u2019re in a fighting mindset.\n\nSome people get gold stars in some cases for overcoming aspects of racism but it\u2019s bizarre to have some gold star system for twisting your sexual preferences to be more progressive.  Noone should be attacked or rewarded in this case.  So I don\u2019t think ones preferences are a subject of moral evaluation even though they\u2019re bad - and the desire to slip into such moral evaluation is a consequence of not fully internalizing what systemic phenomena are.  Not judging people on this is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve.  But it\u2019s not terribly hard to manage once certain arguments are in place\n\nYes these preferences are bad and are evidence of systemic racism - they hurt people by limiting the choices of those who hold them and limiting the approval and choices of those on the other side.  Bad social shit based precisely on race is racism to me, so thats why Im comfortable with using it.  Racism is sensitive, and thats why people should keep this stuff to whispers among friends or in places to intensely discuss this stuff with tons of considerations in place.  An SLF thread cohld be that place but it depends on how the conversation develops. Casually Tossing it out in front of hundreds or thousands of people somewhat off-topic on this thread just isn\u2019t the time.  In fact I think it\u2019s bad to play it loose here because we\u2019re constantly getting girls on here posting and doubting their attractiveness to guys based on their race.  I mean we gotta tell them it narrows the pool but that\u2019s an extremely rough conversation so it pays to use care in the dialogue.",

This is why this post has 150+ emotionally-charged comments on it.\n\n> I don\u2019t date black girls because of their skin tone is RACIST\n\nI don't fully agree with this. Being _attracted_ to a skin tone is a personal, largely unconscious choice. I'm not generally attracted to the pasty-white, translucent skin tone, but I'm far from racist against the 25% northern-European roots I have. Conversely, I've also seen gorgeous ebony tones that I can appreciate, but doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with the owner.\n\nAs long as someone is not completely disregarding their existence, lobbying to limit their rights and freedoms, or portraying all people who look like them as inherently and irredeemably \"ugly\" (which I understand happens on a greater social level, but that's _not_ what anyone here is doing on an individual level), it's egregiously wrong to try to paint people as racists.\n\nYou cannot legislate or otherwise force someone to be attracted to someone else, full-stop.",

As I said, I'll go with the dictionary, thank you.\n\nPOC are not some monolith who think one thing. My point is that plenty of them are tired of the race baiting and the virtue signaling by self-appointed saviors such as yourself who see racism and racists around every corner.\n\nI submit that people like YOU actually do more harm than good. You muddy the waters when you see racism everywhere that you diminish POC's agency by making them feel it's hopeless to try and prosper in our society. You diminsh the word racism to meaningless by overusing it and using it incorrectly while REAL racism gets a smokescreen from you and your ilk.",
