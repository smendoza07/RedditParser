I mean she's not the strongest but I like to see characters for what they could be, their full potential.\n\nTenten has a wide range of abilities, much more than just throwing ninja tools, although that is a good attack. She's also adept in using swords, axes and staves in close combat. And of course paper bombs as well as spiked metal bombs. All of these things she can also put on chakra threads, giving depth to her battle strategy.\n\nShe also has the gigantic iron ball, which can be extremely useful if she could put it on chakra threads and fly around throwing it left and right, and blocking projectiles. Its never been seen, but like I mentioned, she has the potential. \n\nAnd then there's the Sage of the Six Path's fan, which gives her the ability to use all five chakra natures. Throwing fire balls, tornadoes, and waves of water, as well as raining lightning from the sky and controlling the terrain with earth style. \n\nIf she had been put under a bit more pressure she could've really shined. But I suppose the same can be said for just about everyone outside of Team 7. If she were more of a strategist who could make the best use of her tools and trained harder, like Sakura or Temari, then she would be pretty dangerous.",

I mean she's not the strongest but I like to see characters for what they could be, their full potential.\n\nTenten has a wide range of abilities, much more than just throwing ninja tools, although that is a good attack. She's also adept in using swords, axes and staves in close combat. And of course paper bombs as well as spiked metal bombs. All of these things she can also put on chakra threads, giving depth to her battle strategy.\n\nShe also has the gigantic iron ball, which can be extremely useful if she could put it on chakra threads and fly around throwing it left and right, and blocking projectiles. Its never been seen, but like I mentioned, she has the potential. \n\nAnd then there's the Sage of the Six Path's fan, which gives her the ability to use all five chakra natures. Throwing fire balls, tornadoes, and waves of water, as well as raining lightning from the sky and controlling the terrain with earth style. \n\nIf she had been put under a bit more pressure she could've really shined. But I suppose the same can be said for just about everyone outside of Team 7. If she were more of a strategist who could make the best use of her tools and trained harder, like Sakura or Temari, then she would be pretty dangerous.",

She's also adept in using swords, axes and staves in close combat. And of course paper bombs as well as spiked metal bombs. All of these things she can also put on chakra threads, giving depth to her battle strategy.\n\nShe also has the gigantic iron ball, which can be extremely useful if she could put it on chakra threads and fly around throwing it left and right, and blocking projectiles. Its never been seen, but like I mentioned, she has the potential. \n\nAnd then there's the Sage of the Six Path's fan, which gives her the ability to use all five chakra natures. Throwing fire balls, tornadoes, and waves of water, as well as raining lightning from the sky and controlling the terrain with earth style. \n\nIf she had been put under a bit more pressure she could've really shined. But I suppose the same can be said for just about everyone outside of Team 7. If she were more of a strategist who could make the best use of her tools and trained harder, like Sakura or Temari, then she would be pretty dangerous.",
