    "body": "  \n\nThe young lady waved when I walked up onto the patio, and I turned to look behind me, in order to discern who, the man or woman was that could be deserving of such enthusiasm. There was nobody there. She was waving at me.\n\nThen I noticed a resemblance to the POT I was supposed to be meeting for our first M&G. Clearly thinner, and in better physical shape than I remember.  Red hair, in lieu of the blonde hair in her profile pictures, and a dazzling smile she had not shared in any of her pictures. \n\nShe stood up to greet me and was wearing a great fitting pair of jeans, an almost-too-small tank top, and Hi-viz orange sneakers. Perfect.\n\nWe grabbed a cup of coffee and went out the door to walk around downtown and enjoy the weather while practicing semi-proper social distancing. 3 blocks later, she stepped off the curb to cross the street, and dropped like a sack of bricks, with her right leg at an ungodly angle, starting about mid-thigh. \n\nMy mind goes straight to a broken femur, while silently asking: \n\n*\u201cHow the fuck do you snap your leg, stepping off a 4\u201d curb?\u201d*\n\nIt took me a second to come to terms with what I was seeing, and her failure to scream in pain. It was even more disconcerting when she sat up, grabbed her leg at the break, and put it back in place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to find somewhere to pull my pants down. I think something broke or came loose.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Gee, ya think?\u201d*\n\nLooking at my normally olive-colored, Latino face turning a shade somewhere between green and stark white \u2013 a light lime, if you will \u2013 she then eased my concern and added some shock by informing me that her PROSTHETIC LEG, had popped loose. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t covered in any of our conversations. I would probably have remembered that minute tidbit of information and not suggested WALKING ALL OVER DOWNTOWN TULSA.  \n\nI felt like a real shit heel. \n\nAfter she got everything adjusted, I offered that we just sit somewhere and talk, but she insisted we keep walking. \n\nWe finally reached a point where I could laugh at myself and the whole situation. We had a great time, some outstanding conversation, and made a date for this afternoon.\n\nA Sitting Date.",
