If your face has relatively equal measurements, but your jaw is less than your cheeks and it's rounded/soft, you have a ROUND face shape. This one is pretty easy to spot.\n2. If your face has has wide cheekbone measurements compared to your forehead and jaw, you will have a pointed chin and prominent cheekbones. This is a DIAMOND face shape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. If your Jaw is wider than your forehead and cheekbones, you have TRIANGLE face shape.\n\n4. If your forehead is wider than your jaw, and your face length is greater than width of cheekbones, you have an OVAL face shape.\n\n5. If your face have practically equal measurements, and your jaw is angular, you have a SQUARE face shape.\n\n6. If your face has relatively equal measurements, but it's longer than it is wide, you have an OBLONG face shape.\n\n7. If your jaw is smallest, cheekbones are the middle, and forehead is largest, you have a HEART face shape.",
