    "body": "I read the sub rules and I hope I am not crossing any lines here. \n\nI am not here to encourage or discourage any lifestyle or preference but I am trying to understand a mentality which I have seen in this sub from time to time but also in another sugar sub which I was recently banished from. \n\nPlease understand this is not directed at all of you, nor any specific person, but if you feel you relate to what I am talking about I would like to understand your mindset more.\n\nFor the past two years I have done both sex work and sugar dating and have switched between the two. I am currently active in the \"sugar bowl\".\n\nI have seen posts and comments from time to time from mostly SDs who seem uncomfortable or disagreeable or even offended with the idea that sugar dating and sex workers (or engaging sex workers) aren't somehow polar opposites. Which is fine and I am not wanting to start a debate on how closely or not they are related.\n\nBut I have seen some take it a step further and bash escorts/\"Johns\" and make some kind of moral argument against sex work and sex workers and seem to think that they are above that \"transaction\". \n\nI have been able to gain insight into both the worlds of sex work and sugar and I don't see how any person, whether a female receiving any form of payment, or a man entering into a transaction, can claim moral high ground. The sugar bowl is full of mostly married men, and younger women willing to do or be or give something for, in part, financial benefit. It's not to say that no aspect of that can be meaningful or relationship-like but how can a SD hand over cash in a hotel room to a young woman and claim some moral high ground over \"escorts\" and \"Johns\"?\n\nI feel it is hypocritical to have moral objection to sex workers or sense of superiority over them when you are a SD.\n\nAgain this is not directed at all SDs or even most but I am trying to understand this mindset and would like some insight and mature discussion",

I think the differences are for the worker are the 4 Ps: pay, privacy, preference, and priviledge. \n\nIn order to have a positive experience, the worker needs to have the level of privacy she desires. If she's a proud porn or  Instagram girl, she'll want the recognition that can bring. If she's a private girl, she'll prefer discrete sugar situations.\n\nNext the worker will need to earn enough money to make it worthwhile. A young woman or man might make $500 a meeting, but if the sugar lifestyle is endangering their reputation and they could make $15 an hour for now and $100 an hour with career success, they need to consider if exposures could ruin their prospects and if it's worthwhile. \n\nPersonal boundaries and preferences are another consideration. If a worker isn't turned on by physical intimacy with men but does enjoy being looked at, he or she will probably be happier as a stripper or Instagram girl rather than a sugar baby or hooker. On the other hand a worker who enjoys touch but values privacy would do better as a sugar baby or escort instead of a cam girl, porn star or instagirl.",

I only sugar cos I am married (happily) but I am also a pig and cant be monogamous (judge me all you want, see if I care).\n\nOne of my SB was an escort, first time we met she seemed upset so I comforted her, said I dont want sex and talked to her for hours (obviously I was paying for her time as well). Got her some wine and discussed her life at length. She said nobody has ever done that for her and her usual meeting start and end with sex. When she felt better, she insisted that she wanted to have sex so we did it but she didnt accept money for the time we were just talking.\n\nShe contacted me whenever she felt low and wanted some advice and I played the role of a life counselor. I also tried helping financially but she only ever accepted it when we got intimate. She said she was a very sexual person and enjoyed it with me. I guess that's what I look for in a sugar relation. Had I just slept with her the first time with no regard of her feelings, that would have been a typical escorting transaction.\n\nMy 2nd SB is someone I met for a business. She is a bright young girl with some anxiety issues and her bf wasnt matured enough to talk to her. We developed a chemistry and she expressed that she liked me knowing I was married. She broke up with her bf and we have been dating for a while. I help with all her finances and she exercise her right to ask for anything (cash or gift) because of our income inequality so its borderline sugar relationship.\n\nMy point being, there shouldn't be any moral judgement on how a person wants to live his/her life. But I personally look for more than sex in a sugar relationship than what I look for with an escort. I obviously respect everyone equally. Just because I feel they are different doesnt mean that I take a moral ground against escorts or anyone for that matter.",

That's not my intention.\n\nI don't have a problem with sex workers, I've been with some myself.  Being a sex worker to me means you treat sex like a job.  You might like your job or might not, but you wouldn't be there if you weren't getting paid and there are certainly things you do for your job that you don't like to do.  Having attraction, chemistry and a connection with a client may be nice, but certainly not required and often barriers are put up to prevent the development of feelings.\n\nMany Sugar Babies treat sugaring like a job and are clearly sex workers in the classic way.  I have met some and had very short time arrangements.  I personally look for longer term arrangements with Sugar Babies that will not be intimate with someone without attraction, chemistry and a connection.  They don't treat the relationship like a job, truly enjoy being with their SD, don't put up barriers and often times feelings do develop.  I still re  main friends with 3 of my former SB's, one from more than 8 years ago.  She asked me to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day (the engagement broke off, so I avoided a very awkward situation lol).  My last SB became my live in girlfriend, we were together more than 4 years, lived together for more than 2 years and had discussed marriage and children.

I had one SB that became my Sugar GF (no allowance was given), and had another sugar baby that I saw for 6 months, and we broke it off when she moved, when she came back, she offered to be my GF instead of my SB, but I was involved at the time. So I also tend to connect with real women, that are not professional, and not looking at sugar as any kind of work, and would be offended if I implied as much.",

But the SBs I am looking to spend time with don't think of themselves as sex workers. At all. Maybe it's partly a generational thing. I remember the days of aspd and Backpage and TER. The two call system where you were up a date with an escort and she gives you an address and you call/text from that address and you get a room #. The first time she sees you is literally the second she opens the door. Compare that with sugar where pics and texts are exchanged and a raport develops. A relationship and connection form. That is the basis of an SR. And if you don't see the difference between an SR and sex work, you're exactly who I'm looking to avoid.",

            "body": "Personally for me its not a moral high ground as much as just trying to weed through women who view sugaring like sex work, and are only there for themselves (many do not even like older guys) and woman who view it as a relationship (and are there for a connection & something meaningful). It all comes down to intention, because ultimately the 2 types of women, are going to treat me very differently.\n\nIf I wanted meaningless sex with a professional, that has a great reputation, I would see an escort. No moral/ethical issue there. The ultimate problem with this for me is wanting to sleep with a women that actually wants to sleep with me. From what I've seen, most of the women that post in Sex worker forums, dont actually like older men and would normally choose to sleep with younger guys. I know some men dont care about this either way, but me personally, I want to be with someone who wants to be with me, who initiates sex, who isnt on the clock, and looking for excuses to go home. Someone who treats me like she would a BF, and looks for reasons to spend time with me, rather then reasons to go home.\n\nIf I want to have a connection and real chemistry with a woman, and see her on a continuing basis I will form a relationship with a sugar baby. With the right sugar baby, I can have an actual casual or exclusive relationship. A real connection, real chemistry, and someone that truly enjoys my company, and isnt also sleeping with a ton of other guys.\n\nWhen you hear people on this Sub say that Escorts / Johns have ruined the sugar bowl, its not a moral issue for most, it because these people remember a time, when Seeking was full of regular people looking for real sugar relationships, and not someone who was looking to sleep with a bunch of guys, trying to make the most money, in the shortest of time, and get paid per date.\n\nIt seems the disdain goes both ways. Ive seen what the SW post on the other Subs concerning the sugar lifestyle, and most SW seem to look down on sugar babies for being naive, for not getting more money because they spend so much time with their SD, and also look down on SD, for being Johns in denial. From what ive seen, it appears that most SW dont understand that while a lot of SB do this for money, unlike a SW who looks at it like her profession, most SB are also looking for a connection, and want something thats closer to a relationship, then to a client / pro relationship. Most SB aren't juggling multiple SD's, the ones that do, are more closer to be low volume escorts, whether they realize it or not. Most sugar babies are doing this to better themselves because they are in school, or just starting out in their career, versus a SW who is really only in it for the money. So its not a moral / ethical reason, it comes down to intent, and why you're their. While some men don't care why you're there, a majority of real SD do\n\n.\n\nI believe sugar relationships run the full gamut between SW and a Relationship. \n\nSR that are hotel only with mostly married guys a few times a month.\n\nSR that are FWB, have indoor and outdoor dates on a weekly basis\n\nSR that are exclusive / monogamous, with an emotional connection\n\nSR that are really close to committed vanilla relationships\n\nBut categorically speaking, sugar relationships have always been a relationship (not a transaction) between a younger woman and an older wealthy man, and have been around for centuries in one form or another including sugar babies, mistress and kept woman. The one common denominator is these women were all in a relationship. These woman were usually exclusive to him, they were not sleeping with other men, they didnt have mulitple men, and they didnt negotiate the relationship on a time for money basis like SW.  As sugar dating got more popular in the past century, affluent men sought out younger beautiful women to date, not to hire. These women were not on the clock, there was no pay per date. You got a monthly allowance, and you saw each other, whenever you both wanted to, just like a normal relationship. So if you wonder why many say that SW have ruined the sugar bowl, is because they've brought their transactional business way of thinking to something that was previously a relationship, and created a hybrid between sugar and SW. The modern SR has definitely cross the line between relationship and SW, where as the traditional SR was always a relationship.",

The last POT I met wanted unlimited sex (he wanted me to skip work and/or be with him 4-5 days a week, and he wanted every date to JUST be sex - no going out or anything) and he offered me 800 a month. That's 800 a month to deal with someone who is incredibly needy, demands texting/sexting and pics/vids all day (even when I'm at work), and expects sex 4-5 times a week. \n\nAnother POT I had a M&G with DIDN'T EVEN PAY FOR MY COFFEE! I had one POT tell me that he expected sex after every date (BB, unprotected sex, at that), but that there would be NO allowance or PPM. He thought that taking me to a nice dinner or buying me some fancy handbag that I don't even need was worth risking my life and my health. He also refused to get STI testing done, even though I always keep recent test results.\n\nAs a POT SB, I kept meeting guys who were using Seeking as Tinder. They had nothing to offer me as far as mentorship, were stingy even with gifts and M&Gs, and expected a constant stream of NSA sex. They wanted a SWer; they just didn't want to pay for one. I decided that if sugaring is just SW, I may as well be honest about it and at least get paid. :/",

If real SD were in abundance, and now they are not, quite possibly they got really tired of sifting through all the sex workers that flooded the site, and went back to free styling like they did for decades before the internet existed. Its much easier for SD to free style, then SB.\n\nSeeing there are so many sex workers, and sugar babies that dont know the difference between sugar and sex work, it has resulted in the Johns using seeking as a hunting ground. So this is a reciprocal problem. Sexworkers come to seeking, which brings Johns to seeking, and now SB turn to sex work, because they cant find any real SD.",

The latter one with 30 years, was a very special relationship. She was emotionally and mentally mature beyond her years. She was an old soul and at the same time very light hearted and playful. She would stay with me for 1 or 2 days each week. The shortest dates were overnights. She genuinely enjoyed my company, and I felt genuine chemistry and connection with her. We did a mix of indoor and outdoor dates, probably a 65/35 mixture. We talked about transitioning to more of a SGF relationship after she got out of college, but unfortunately the relationship got cut short because of my own stupidity.",

I am playing \"out of my league\" as such; she would never be with me but for Seeking and the money involved. She tolerates lots of generational differences. Just as I tend to think about how old the vanilla peers I occasionally date appear to me now, she must think the same way with me. In fact, she needs to \"warm up\" to me when we meet, usually once every 5-7 days. We don't get a portion of each other's cultural or historical references and we avoid politics, which I am pretty passionate about, just as she is about \"living her best life\" and having fun.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life, but in an LT SR, it has had ups and downs, no pun intended, just as most LT vanilla do. She admitted in the tenth month that she had been sleeping with a FWB, and I was also doing with a peer, whom she knew about. So I am unsurprised when people say that their SRs are not exclusive or they are not monogamous. Why wouldn't a hot young woman want a peer? \n\nAccepting this last reality took me a long time, but I was helped to it by reading the women on here write about the breadth of their approaches to their SDs. My fantasy and my justification for a generous amount of sugar asked me to think that she was \"more into\" our relationship than I think she could muster. After breaking off with a significant ex, and turning 21, she started sugaring. She never wanted to develop feelings for me, though she did, but never to the extent that I fantasized about, mimicking how close sex brings me to those who I really enjoy sleeping with. She is protecting her feelings and trying not to feel vulnerable. \n\nSRs are all different, and are moving targets as time changes the SB and SD, and the \"expiration date\" starts to be felt by one or the other.",

There is a tendency by some here to broadly classify any indoor arrangement as just escorting or money for sex, which may lead newer girls to avoid them for that reason alone.\n\nI completely agree with this 100%. One of my first sugar relationships was with someone I had a 20 year age gap, we had a very good mental and physical connection. All of our dates were indoors, and most were overnights. They included all of the things you mentioned in your post. She didnt really enjoy social settings (nothing to do with dating me, just her personality), so all of our dates were indoors. It never felt like an escort relationship. It was still very meaningful.",

As much as sugar dating is a fantasy at times, the reality is, you can form real connections, with real women, that are not in it just for the money, and truly care & enjoy our company. Plus from our own experiences in sugar, we can usually tell what the intent is. Actions always speak louder then words. Someone that is solely focused on money, is not going to look for ways to spend extra time with you, is not going suggest overnights, or weekends together, is not going to linger and lay there after intimacy. You can always tell when you are a priority, or if she is fitting you into to her schedule.",

In fact I think it should be legal and regulated. \n\nTo be honest I can't really blame anyone looking at the current state of the bowl and not seeing a difference between both worlds. Sugar dating has evolved into something completely different from what it use to be. For most of us who have had genuine sugar **relationships** the thought of calling it sex work is unacceptable to us not because we think less of sex workers but because our relationships looks nothing like sex work. \n\nI don't even participate that much anymore on sugar forums or SLF because the advice I have would come from my personal experiences and those experience vary so greatly form the situations I see being posted on here. It would be grossly irresponsible for me to give traditional arrangement advice to someone getting involved in what is now the sugar world. \n\nThings have changed so much that people have had to create new terms such as spoiled girlfriend and boyfriend to distinguish between others in the bowl. The funny thing is that that use to be what the majority of the bowl was and now instead of being the norm it's something to aspire to. Like a promotion. \"I'm no longer a SB.

I guess it's because modern sugar dating is closer to a variation of SW, then it is to a relationship.",

I think people who are sensitive to it, are misinterpreting what's being said.\n\nIf you go on r/BMW and someone asks \"what model BMW should I get?\", and someone else replies \"C300\", 1. the members are factually correct if they say \"that's not a BMW, that's a Mercedes Benz\", 2. the members should not then be accused of implying that they're taking the moral high ground that BMW is ethically superior to Mercedes Benz.  There's no moral high ground... or maybe the trivial point that on the BMW sub, people should talk about BMWs, particularly if discussion about MBs leads to flame wars.\n\nAnyway, if an SB comes on here and says \"SD contacted me and wants to pay me $X to meet tonight for a drink then hotel room for an hour, and then for an hour once a month after that\", and we reply that that this \"SD\" is really looking for an escort/john type model, not an arrangement:\n\n1. We are factually correct -- this isn't how arrangements usually start or continue\n2. We are not making an ethical judgement\n\nIt's just that there are a lot of escorts and johns in the bowl.  No ethical judgement implied, but those of us looking for an arrangement are not looking for an escort/john model.\n\nIn the big picture, I think we should have a sex workers and clients united front.

I DO NOT HAVE TIME to text with you continually for 20 hours a day. I DO NOT HAVE TIME to meet with you 8 times a week. And I say as much in my profile. So when I encounter these Salt Daddies that legitimately expect the above (with dozens of naked pictures texted to them every day, unprotected sex, and more) and want to pay me $200 a month, then yeah - I'm going to look at it like a sex worker, and it's not worth it.\n\nIf you want a full-time SB at your beck-and-call 24/7, then you need to be paying her AT LEAST as much as she would earn at her full-time job that she has to quit so she can tend to your every whim (plus the cost of the health insurance she gave up for you, and a little extra to accommodate for the inherent uncertainty and resume gap she's going to have). \n\nDo you (hypothetical you, not you in particular) want a SB who has nothing productive to do except be your little fucktoy whenever you call? Because if that's the case, then you're looking for someone who is a PROFESSIONAL SEX WORKER - who that is their only job (and who is compensated accordingly).\n\nI would LOVE to find a great SD who I had real chemistry with, who I could meet up with 1-2 times a week, who I could have great sex with (and we could get better over time because we're doing it regularly), who I could actually treat like a boyfriend, who I could talk to and who would mentor me, who treated me with respect and I treated him with respect... I would like nothing more than to find ONE good SD who I could have that with. But instead, I get, \"Drive 2 hours to have coffee with me and fuck me and I'm not even going to pay for your coffee, but I'll give you a vague promise of $200 a month for putting up with my whiny, needy bullshit 20 hours a day.\"\n\nIf I'm going to be treated like a sex worker, I at least deserve to be fairly compensated.

I DO NOT HAVE TIME to text with you continually for 20 hours a day.\n\nHerein lies the problem. Please dont take this the wrong way. But have you considered that the reason you cant find a REAL SD is because you're not the type of SB they're looking for regardless of what you look like..?\n\nFor the most part, most REAL SD are looking for Sugar babies that are single, college aged or post college aged women with no husband or long term BF.\n\nMost REAL SD arent going to date someone with a husband, in a polyamorous marriage, or even with a longterm BF. Most real SD are looking for something more exclusive. \n\nSo once you take out the REAL SD, you're only meeting whats left in the bow., guys that are only in it for sex. For the most part, these men dont care if your married, poly, or in a longterm relationship of any sort.\n\nHow you come off, and what your intentions are, is also going to be factor on the type of men you attract. Personally my vetting process I can usually weed out women that solely focus on the monetary aspect, and not looking for the relationship aspect, and I know other SD's do this as well. So its quite possible, you come off solely focused on the money and not the relationship.",

I guess I don't understand that type of SD mentality... I don't like dating someone who's boring, who has nothing in their life EXCEPT for me. That's terribly boring and there's never anything to talk about because they're never learning anything new or doing anything fun.\n\nBut it does kind of reinforce my decision not to look for an SR. Needy, clingy, demanding assholes are not people I want to have a relationship with. If a vanilla boyfriend acted that way - demanding my attention 20 hours a day (no, that was NOT an exaggeration), ordering me to take naked selfies in the bathroom at work to send to him, asking me to come over to have sex in his house (no dinner, no date, no nothing) twice a day - I would lose his number within 5 minutes.\n\nSo is it really all about the money? Well, if you're an unbearable, needy, demanding jerk, then yeah, I'm sure as hell not hanging out with you for free. And if you come into an SR with the attitude that you can do whatever tf you want and disrespect the SB just because you're the one with money, then you have no call to get pissy when you discover that she's just in it for the money.\n\nWhen you disrespect my TIME, you disrespect ME, and I don't tolerate it from anyone. Period. Schedule a M&G with me and then no-call, no-show? Lose my number and don't ever approach me again. Ask me to take time away from my PAYING job to tend to your fragile ego? Fuck off. I don't tolerate that behavior from a potential vanilla boyfriend; why should I put up with it with a potential SD?\n\nThank you for confirming that my choice to leave sugaring was the right one. At least in SW, I don't have to deal with entitled, demanding assholes that expect me to subsume my entire life and existence to be a slave to their whims.",

Another came to the M&G and told me at the very beginning that he refused to EVER give cash (no PPM or allowance, regardless of how long we've been in an SR); that he would only \"buy me gifts\" from time to time when he felt like it (that, to me, is more of a \"spoiled girlfriend\" arrangement, which is not what I was looking for). The fourth guy basically ghosted me for a month, then tried to come back around and ask me out again. And 3 M&Gs that I scheduled pulled a no-call, no-show on the M&G itself.\n\nI try to remind myself that those are just the bad apples, but those were my first 7 experiences with sugaring and that's how it turned out. By contrast, one of my SW clients is a professional guy who visits me about once every 1-2 weeks, who I have friendly banter with between sessions, and who sometimes brings me gifts just because he was thinking of me. That's the third SW client I ever saw, and the other 2 (while they didn't become regular clients) were also very respectful and courteous.\n\nWhen \"Johns\" treat SWers better than SDs treat SBs, there's something rotten in the sugar bowl. :(",

I think that exemplifies what has happened to the \"dating world\" in modern society  \n\n\nI have turned to SA as an SD because I am looking for someone who will look at me as someone more than my body, and see me as something other than a walking wallet. I have met some PPM folks on SA, and that can be fun (if that is what is wanted).  \n\nI have a first meeting tonight with someone who seems to have a lot of things in common with me.  A chance for a real relationship that was created and discovered in an environment that allowed me to post who I am, what I want, and what I am able to bring to a relationship.    \n\n\nTraditional sites are full of people looking for a Brad Pitt with a bank account to match.  I appreciate the honesty of what is possible on SA vs a traditional dating site.   \nThe phonies on SA are pretty obvious, and the authentic ones stand out the better for the contrast.  \nThe fact that there are Authentic Ones at all is why I am still on SA.    \nThere are people who want to get to know me for me, and have a relationship with me.  Not just what I can do for them (though I get a LOT of responses from this type too).    \nPerhaps I am naive - but I say I am a hopeful romantic who is really looking for something, and by putting that specificity into my profile I have attracted those who really are what I am looking for.  I am not a fool, in a conversation it becomes pretty obvious when someone is not articulate, intelligent, and is actually looking for something beyond the ordinary.  Someone who can be fun, adventurous, and a contribution (and contribution flows both ways in relationship).  \n\n\nYet the other side can be just as obvious.  People can be fake no matter where you are looking.  The trick is to get past them to find the other souls who are looking for something that is authentic and real.  \n\n\nSugar/SW/Date/Marriage - they are all part of a continuum of a relationship between money and intimacy.  \nHelen Gurley Brown (Editor of Cosmo) once famously said flat out \"Money and Power are Sexy\" and she was right.  \n\n\nHeck, when I was young my father once told me \"It's just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as a poor one\"",

People tend to think of sex workers as willing to sleep with anyone for money. In the Bowl, SBs are certainly seen as money-seeking, but tend to be more selective of their partners. It basically comes down to \"sluttiness.\" SBs aren't necessarily \"loose,\" but they choose to form relationships based primarily on their partners' ability to provide. SBs might even have an exclusive relationship or just a few partners. This is unlikely to be the case with a sex worker.\n\nAlso, generally, the people who can afford to sugar are going to be higher class than your average john. There are of course high-end escorts, but I don't think that's the first thing that comes to people's mind when they think of sex workers.

In fact, I'm in exactly that camp.  I've participated in 4 different areas of the sex industry, and escorting is the one I have no interest in repeating.   That is not a moral judgement, or any other kind of judgement; I also don't like watching soccer or eating shrimp, and have no moral judgement for people who enjoy those (although let's face it, eating the cockroach of the sea is definitely an ethical wobbler).\n\nWhat is a related but different issue, is the experience many SDs have had when interacting with SBs who don't quite get arrangements but instead bring in the norms from their previous work.  Read, for example, what SDs say about their interactions with strippers here (I imagine the highest-hustle areas of the industry, like stripping and camming, are the most egregious here)",

For the street prostitute the quid pro quo is very clear. $50 and I give you a BJ. For marriage it's much more complicated and often subtle, but there is still quid pro quo. The husband must work to provide for the family, must help around the house, must provide emotional support, etc. If the husband decides he's going to quit his job and just watch TV all day...well the sex goes away quickly and divorce is up next. If you don't think there is a quid pro quo in marriage just try it. Quit your job and become a bum. How long will the wife stay with you?\n\nSo we're just debating where in the spectrum of quid pro quo SW is, where in the spectrum SR is. In such a spectrum is there overlap. At the extremes it's easy to discern, but often it's not easy to see where one ends and the other begins.\n\nThere is no reason to judge others unless their actions are directly affecting you.",

That's not what it is -- it's saying \"you are looking for an arrangement, and the person you're engaging with is on a different model\".  That has also been the source of a lot of hurt feelings from people coming in here from the sexworker sub. \n\n1. Pointing out the fact that someone is behaving more along an escort rather than arrangement model is an extremely important piece of feedback here.  A person here asking a question has every right to know whether the POT with whom they're engaging is really after an arrangement, or something different, and we have every right to tell them.\n2. Pointing that fact out does not imply moral superiority, or condemnation of escorts or their clients, or anything else.  \n\nBeyond this, any number of SDs and SBs here have acknowledge patronizing or being former or current escorts, strippers, camgirls, FBSM providers.  Those are areas of the sex industry that are not sugar -- but some may find fun to engage in or provide for.  No problem.",

I think the differences are for the worker are the 4 Ps: pay, privacy, preference, and priviledge. \n\nIn order to have a positive experience, the worker needs to have the level of privacy she desires. If she's a proud porn or  Instagram girl, she'll want the recognition that can bring. If she's a private girl, she'll prefer discrete sugar situations.\n\nNext the worker will need to earn enough money to make it worthwhile. A young woman or man might make $500 a meeting, but if the sugar lifestyle is endangering their reputation and they could make $15 an hour for now and $100 an hour with career success, they need to consider if exposures could ruin their prospects and if it's worthwhile. \n\nPersonal boundaries and preferences are another consideration. If a worker isn't turned on by physical intimacy with men but does enjoy being looked at, he or she will probably be happier as a stripper or Instagram girl rather than a sugar baby or hooker. On the other hand a worker who enjoys touch but values privacy would do better as a sugar baby or escort instead of a cam girl, porn star or instagirl.",

That's 800 a month to deal with someone who is incredibly needy, demands texting/sexting and pics/vids all day (even when I'm at work), and expects sex 4-5 times a week. \n\nAnother POT I had a M&G with DIDN'T EVEN PAY FOR MY COFFEE! I had one POT tell me that he expected sex after every date (BB, unprotected sex, at that), but that there would be NO allowance or PPM. He thought that taking me to a nice dinner or buying me some fancy handbag that I don't even need was worth risking my life and my health. He also refused to get STI testing done, even though I always keep recent test results.\n\nAs a POT SB, I kept meeting guys who were using Seeking as Tinder. They had nothing to offer me as far as mentorship, were stingy even with gifts and M&Gs, and expected a constant stream of NSA sex. They wanted a SWer; they just didn't want to pay for one. I decided that if sugaring is just SW, I may as well be honest about it and at least get paid. :/",

If real SD were in abundance, and now they are not, quite possibly they got really tired of sifting through all the sex workers that flooded the site, and went back to free styling like they did for decades before the internet existed. Its much easier for SD to free style, then SB.\n\nSeeing there are so many sex workers, and sugar babies that dont know the difference between sugar and sex work, it has resulted in the Johns using seeking as a hunting ground. So this is a reciprocal problem. Sexworkers come to seeking, which brings Johns to seeking, and now SB turn to sex work, because they cant find any real SD.",

She tolerates lots of generational differences. Just as I tend to think about how old the vanilla peers I occasionally date appear to me now, she must think the same way with me. In fact, she needs to \"warm up\" to me when we meet, usually once every 5-7 days. We don't get a portion of each other's cultural or historical references and we avoid politics, which I am pretty passionate about, just as she is about \"living her best life\" and having fun.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life, but in an LT SR, it has had ups and downs, no pun intended, just as most LT vanilla do. She admitted in the tenth month that she had been sleeping with a FWB, and I was also doing with a peer, whom she knew about. So I am unsurprised when people say that their SRs are not exclusive or they are not monogamous. Why wouldn't a hot young woman want a peer? \n\nAccepting this last reality took me a long time, but I was helped to it by reading the women on here write about the breadth of their approaches to their SDs. My fantasy and my justification for a generous amount of sugar asked me to think that she was \"more into\" our relationship than I think she could muster. After breaking off with a significant ex, and turning 21, she started sugaring. She never wanted to develop feelings for me, though she did, but never to the extent that I fantasized about, mimicking how close sex brings me to those who I really enjoy sleeping with. She is protecting her feelings and trying not to feel vulnerable. \n\nSRs are all different, and are moving targets as time changes the SB and SD, and the \"expiration date\" starts to be felt by one or the other.",

There is a tendency by some here to broadly classify any indoor arrangement as just escorting or money for sex, which may lead newer girls to avoid them for that reason alone.\n\nI completely agree with this 100%. One of my first sugar relationships was with someone I had a 20 year age gap, we had a very good mental and physical connection. All of our dates were indoors, and most were overnights. They included all of the things you mentioned in your post. She didnt really enjoy social settings (nothing to do with dating me, just her personality), so all of our dates were indoors. It never felt like an escort relationship. It was still very meaningful.",

Plus from our own experiences in sugar, we can usually tell what the intent is. Actions always speak louder then words. Someone that is solely focused on money, is not going to look for ways to spend extra time with you, is not going suggest overnights, or weekends together, is not going to linger and lay there after intimacy. You can always tell when you are a priority, or if she is fitting you into to her schedule.",

Because if that's the case, then you're looking for someone who is a PROFESSIONAL SEX WORKER - who that is their only job (and who is compensated accordingly).\n\nI would LOVE to find a great SD who I had real chemistry with, who I could meet up with 1-2 times a week, who I could have great sex with (and we could get better over time because we're doing it regularly), who I could actually treat like a boyfriend, who I could talk to and who would mentor me, who treated me with respect and I treated him with respect... I would like nothing more than to find ONE good SD who I could have that with. But instead, I get, \"Drive 2 hours to have coffee with me and fuck me and I'm not even going to pay for your coffee, but I'll give you a vague promise of $200 a month for putting up with my whiny, needy bullshit 20 hours a day.\"\n\nIf I'm going to be treated like a sex worker, I at least deserve to be fairly compensated. Finding a REAL SD these days is like a needle in a haystack.",

I DO NOT HAVE TIME to text with you continually for 20 hours a day.\n\nHerein lies the problem. Please dont take this the wrong way. But have you considered that the reason you cant find a REAL SD is because you're not the type of SB they're looking for regardless of what you look like..?\n\nFor the most part, most REAL SD are looking for Sugar babies that are single, college aged or post college aged women with no husband or long term BF.\n\nMost REAL SD arent going to date someone with a husband, in a polyamorous marriage, or even with a longterm BF. Most real SD are looking for something more exclusive. \n\nSo once you take out the REAL SD, you're only meeting whats left in the bow., guys that are only in it for sex. For the most part, these men dont care if your married, poly, or in a longterm relationship of any sort.\n\nHow you come off, and what your intentions are, is also going to be factor on the type of men you attract. Personally my vetting process I can usually weed out women that solely focus on the monetary aspect, and not looking for the relationship aspect, and I know other SD's do this as well. So its quite possible, you come off solely focused on the money and not the relationship.",

I guess I don't understand that type of SD mentality... I don't like dating someone who's boring, who has nothing in their life EXCEPT for me. That's terribly boring and there's never anything to talk about because they're never learning anything new or doing anything fun.\n\nBut it does kind of reinforce my decision not to look for an SR. Needy, clingy, demanding assholes are not people I want to have a relationship with. If a vanilla boyfriend acted that way - demanding my attention 20 hours a day (no, that was NOT an exaggeration), ordering me to take naked selfies in the bathroom at work to send to him, asking me to come over to have sex in his house (no dinner, no date, no nothing) twice a day - I would lose his number within 5 minutes.\n\nSo is it really all about the money? Well, if you're an unbearable, needy, demanding jerk, then yeah, I'm sure as hell not hanging out with you for free. And if you come into an SR with the attitude that you can do whatever tf you want and disrespect the SB just because you're the one with money, then you have no call to get pissy when you discover that she's just in it for the money.\n\nWhen you disrespect my TIME, you disrespect ME, and I don't tolerate it from anyone. Period. Schedule a M&G with me and then no-call, no-show? Lose my number and don't ever approach me again. Ask me to take time away from my PAYING job to tend to your fragile ego? Fuck off. I don't tolerate that behavior from a potential vanilla boyfriend; why should I put up with it with a potential SD?\n\nThank you for confirming that my choice to leave sugaring was the right one. At least in SW, I don't have to deal with entitled, demanding assholes that expect me to subsume my entire life and existence to be a slave to their whims.",

One of those guys, after the first M&G, was texting me 18-20 hours a day, demanding nudes from me at work, etc. Another guy came to the M&G and didn't even buy me coffee. Another came to the M&G and told me at the very beginning that he refused to EVER give cash (no PPM or allowance, regardless of how long we've been in an SR); that he would only \"buy me gifts\" from time to time when he felt like it (that, to me, is more of a \"spoiled girlfriend\" arrangement, which is not what I was looking for). The fourth guy basically ghosted me for a month, then tried to come back around and ask me out again. And 3 M&Gs that I scheduled pulled a no-call, no-show on the M&G itself.\n\nI try to remind myself that those are just the bad apples, but those were my first 7 experiences with sugaring and that's how it turned out. By contrast, one of my SW clients is a professional guy who visits me about once every 1-2 weeks, who I have friendly banter with between sessions, and who sometimes brings me gifts just because he was thinking of me. That's the third SW client I ever saw, and the other 2 (while they didn't become regular clients) were also very respectful and courteous.\n\nWhen \"Johns\" treat SWers better than SDs treat SBs, there's something rotten in the sugar bowl. :(",

From my perspective, I actually do think it's all sex work (overlapping venn diagram, to more or lesser extent) but the experiences are completely different, so different it's possible to really love arrangements or escorting, but really not enjoy the other.  In fact, I'm in exactly that camp.  I've participated in 4 different areas of the sex industry, and escorting is the one I have no interest in repeating.   That is not a moral judgement, or any other kind of judgement; I also don't like watching soccer or eating shrimp, and have no moral judgement for people who enjoy those (although let's face it, eating the cockroach of the sea is definitely an ethical wobbler).\n\nWhat is a related but different issue, is the experience many SDs have had when interacting with SBs who don't quite get arrangements but instead bring in the norms from their previous work.  Read, for example, what SDs say about their interactions with strippers here (I imagine the highest-hustle areas of the industry, like stripping and camming, are the most egregious here)",

That has also been the source of a lot of hurt feelings from people coming in here from the sexworker sub. \n\n1. Pointing out the fact that someone is behaving more along an escort rather than arrangement model is an extremely important piece of feedback here.  A person here asking a question has every right to know whether the POT with whom they're engaging is really after an arrangement, or something different, and we have every right to tell them.\n2. Pointing that fact out does not imply moral superiority, or condemnation of escorts or their clients, or anything else.  \n\nBeyond this, any number of SDs and SBs here have acknowledge patronizing or being former or current escorts, strippers, camgirls, FBSM providers.

Sugar daddies never negotiated with sugar babies, and offered them xxx for 4 hours of time Thursday night each week. Sugar daddies invited a women for dinner or drinks, and if there was any connection and chemistry, he would ask if she would like to date, and he would let her know that he would help her pay her rent / tuition and give her a some kind of monthly allowance. A sugar relationship was a relationship between an older man and a younger women. They were actually dating, and it wasnt based on a number of meets or a certain amount of hours. Sometimes these relationships lasted for years, and then they would part ways and other times they would transition from sugar baby to trophy wife.\n\nBefore seeking, there were no platform where sugar babies actively sought out sugar daddies. For the most part, the SD sought out and found women to date out in the real world.",

I think the differences are for the worker are the 4 Ps: pay, privacy, preference, and priviledge. \n\nIn order to have a positive experience, the worker needs to have the level of privacy she desires. If she's a proud porn or  Instagram girl, she'll want the recognition that can bring. If she's a private girl, she'll prefer discrete sugar situations.\n\nNext the worker will need to earn enough money to make it worthwhile. A young woman or man might make $500 a meeting, but if the sugar lifestyle is endangering their reputation and they could make $15 an hour for now and $100 an hour with career success, they need to consider if exposures could ruin their prospects and if it's worthwhile. \n\nPersonal boundaries and preferences are another consideration. If a worker isn't turned on by physical intimacy with men but does enjoy being looked at, he or she will probably be happier as a stripper or Instagram girl rather than a sugar baby or hooker. On the other hand a worker who enjoys touch but values privacy would do better as a sugar baby or escort instead of a cam girl, porn star or instagirl.",

Personally I have no issue with outdoor, even with a large gap.\n\nMy smallest gap was 15 years and largest was 30. Two of my best SR had 20 and 30 year age gaps respectively. The latter one with 30 years, was a very special relationship. She was emotionally and mentally mature beyond her years. She was an old soul and at the same time very light hearted and playful. She would stay with me for 1 or 2 days each week. The shortest dates were overnights. She genuinely enjoyed my company, and I felt genuine chemistry and connection with her. We did a mix of indoor and outdoor dates, probably a 65/35 mixture. We talked about transitioning to more of a SGF relationship after she got out of college, but unfortunately the relationship got cut short because of my own stupidity.",

She tolerates lots of generational differences. Just as I tend to think about how old the vanilla peers I occasionally date appear to me now, she must think the same way with me. In fact, she needs to \"warm up\" to me when we meet, usually once every 5-7 days. We don't get a portion of each other's cultural or historical references and we avoid politics, which I am pretty passionate about, just as she is about \"living her best life\" and having fun.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life, but in an LT SR, it has had ups and downs, no pun intended, just as most LT vanilla do. She admitted in the tenth month that she had been sleeping with a FWB, and I was also doing with a peer, whom she knew about. So I am unsurprised when people say that their SRs are not exclusive or they are not monogamous. Why wouldn't a hot young woman want a peer? \n\nAccepting this last reality took me a long time, but I was helped to it by reading the women on here write about the breadth of their approaches to their SDs. My fantasy and my justification for a generous amount of sugar asked me to think that she was \"more into\" our relationship than I think she could muster. After breaking off with a significant ex, and turning 21, she started sugaring. She never wanted to develop feelings for me, though she did, but never to the extent that I fantasized about, mimicking how close sex brings me to those who I really enjoy sleeping with. She is protecting her feelings and trying not to feel vulnerable. \n\nSRs are all different, and are moving targets as time changes the SB and SD, and the \"expiration date\" starts to be felt by one or the other.",

One of my first sugar relationships was with someone I had a 20 year age gap, we had a very good mental and physical connection. All of our dates were indoors, and most were overnights. They included all of the things you mentioned in your post. She didnt really enjoy social settings (nothing to do with dating me, just her personality), so all of our dates were indoors.

As much as sugar dating is a fantasy at times, the reality is, you can form real connections, with real women, that are not in it just for the money, and truly care & enjoy our company. Plus from our own experiences in sugar, we can usually tell what the intent is. Actions always speak louder then words. Someone that is solely focused on money, is not going to look for ways to spend extra time with you, is not going suggest overnights, or weekends together, is not going to linger and lay there after intimacy. You can always tell when you are a priority, or if she is fitting you into to her schedule.",

So when I encounter these Salt Daddies that legitimately expect the above (with dozens of naked pictures texted to them every day, unprotected sex, and more) and want to pay me $200 a month, then yeah - I'm going to look at it like a sex worker, and it's not worth it.\n\nIf you want a full-time SB at your beck-and-call 24/7, then you need to be paying her AT LEAST as much as she would earn at her full-time job that she has to quit so she can tend to your every whim (plus the cost of the health insurance she gave up for you, and a little extra to accommodate for the inherent uncertainty and resume gap she's going to have). \n\nDo you (hypothetical you, not you in particular) want a SB who has nothing productive to do except be your little fucktoy whenever you call? Because if that's the case, then you're looking for someone who is a PROFESSIONAL SEX WORKER - who that is their only job (and who is compensated accordingly).\n\nI would LOVE to find a great SD who I had real chemistry with, who I could meet up with 1-2 times a week, who I could have great sex with (and we could get better over time because we're doing it regularly), who I could actually treat like a boyfriend, who I could talk to and who would mentor me, who treated me with respect and I treated him with respect... I would like nothing more than to find ONE good SD who I could have that with. But instead, I get, \"Drive 2 hours to have coffee with me and fuck me and I'm not even going to pay for your coffee, but I'll give you a vague promise of $200 a month for putting up with my whiny, needy bullshit 20 hours a day.\"\n\nIf I'm going to be treated like a sex worker, I at least deserve to be fairly compensated.

But have you considered that the reason you cant find a REAL SD is because you're not the type of SB they're looking for regardless of what you look like..?\n\nFor the most part, most REAL SD are looking for Sugar babies that are single, college aged or post college aged women with no husband or long term BF.\n\nMost REAL SD arent going to date someone with a husband, in a polyamorous marriage, or even with a longterm BF. Most real SD are looking for something more exclusive. \n\nSo once you take out the REAL SD, you're only meeting whats left in the bow., guys that are only in it for sex. For the most part, these men dont care if your married, poly, or in a longterm relationship of any sort.\n\nHow you come off, and what your intentions are, is also going to be factor on the type of men you attract. Personally my vetting process I can usually weed out women that solely focus on the monetary aspect, and not looking for the relationship aspect, and I know other SD's do this as well.

That's terribly boring and there's never anything to talk about because they're never learning anything new or doing anything fun.\n\nBut it does kind of reinforce my decision not to look for an SR. Needy, clingy, demanding assholes are not people I want to have a relationship with. If a vanilla boyfriend acted that way - demanding my attention 20 hours a day (no, that was NOT an exaggeration), ordering me to take naked selfies in the bathroom at work to send to him, asking me to come over to have sex in his house (no dinner, no date, no nothing) twice a day - I would lose his number within 5 minutes.\n\nSo is it really all about the money? Well, if you're an unbearable, needy, demanding jerk, then yeah, I'm sure as hell not hanging out with you for free. And if you come into an SR with the attitude that you can do whatever tf you want and disrespect the SB just because you're the one with money, then you have no call to get pissy when you discover that she's just in it for the money.\n\nWhen you disrespect my TIME, you disrespect ME, and I don't tolerate it from anyone. Period. Schedule a M&G with me and then no-call, no-show? Lose my number and don't ever approach me again. Ask me to take time away from my PAYING job to tend to your fragile ego? Fuck off. I don't tolerate that behavior from a potential vanilla boyfriend; why should I put up with it with a potential SD?\n\nThank you for confirming that my choice to leave sugaring was the right one.

One of those guys, after the first M&G, was texting me 18-20 hours a day, demanding nudes from me at work, etc. Another guy came to the M&G and didn't even buy me coffee. Another came to the M&G and told me at the very beginning that he refused to EVER give cash (no PPM or allowance, regardless of how long we've been in an SR); that he would only \"buy me gifts\" from time to time when he felt like it (that, to me, is more of a \"spoiled girlfriend\" arrangement, which is not what I was looking for). The fourth guy basically ghosted me for a month, then tried to come back around and ask me out again. And 3 M&Gs that I scheduled pulled a no-call, no-show on the M&G itself.\n\nI try to remind myself that those are just the bad apples, but those were my first 7 experiences with sugaring and that's how it turned out. By contrast, one of my SW clients is a professional guy who visits me about once every 1-2 weeks, who I have friendly banter with between sessions, and who sometimes brings me gifts just because he was thinking of me. That's the third SW client I ever saw, and the other 2 (while they didn't become regular clients) were also very respectful and courteous.\n\nWhen \"Johns\" treat SWers better than SDs treat SBs, there's something rotten in the sugar bowl. :(",

Because for the life of me everytime I see that statement I just can't wrap my head around someone saying because he cares for me and I genuinely care for him I no longer deserve to be provided for but the girl who's in it only for the cash does.",

She tolerates lots of generational differences. Just as I tend to think about how old the vanilla peers I occasionally date appear to me now, she must think the same way with me. In fact, she needs to \"warm up\" to me when we meet, usually once every 5-7 days. We don't get a portion of each other's cultural or historical references and we avoid politics, which I am pretty passionate about, just as she is about \"living her best life\" and having fun.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life, but in an LT SR, it has had ups and downs, no pun intended, just as most LT vanilla do. She admitted in the tenth month that she had been sleeping with a FWB, and I was also doing with a peer, whom she knew about. So I am unsurprised when people say that their SRs are not exclusive or they are not monogamous. Why wouldn't a hot young woman want a peer? \n\nAccepting this last reality took me a long time, but I was helped to it by reading the women on here write about the breadth of their approaches to their SDs. My fantasy and my justification for a generous amount of sugar asked me to think that she was \"more into\" our relationship than I think she could muster. After breaking off with a significant ex, and turning 21, she started sugaring. She never wanted to develop feelings for me, though she did, but never to the extent that I fantasized about, mimicking how close sex brings me to those who I really enjoy sleeping with. She is protecting her feelings and trying not to feel vulnerable. \n\nSRs are all different, and are moving targets as time changes the SB and SD, and the \"expiration date\" starts to be felt by one or the other.",

Because if that's the case, then you're looking for someone who is a PROFESSIONAL SEX WORKER - who that is their only job (and who is compensated accordingly).\n\nI would LOVE to find a great SD who I had real chemistry with, who I could meet up with 1-2 times a week, who I could have great sex with (and we could get better over time because we're doing it regularly), who I could actually treat like a boyfriend, who I could talk to and who would mentor me, who treated me with respect and I treated him with respect... I would like nothing more than to find ONE good SD who I could have that with. But instead, I get, \"Drive 2 hours to have coffee with me and fuck me and I'm not even going to pay for your coffee, but I'll give you a vague promise of $200 a month for putting up with my whiny, needy bullshit 20 hours a day.\"\n\nIf I'm going to be treated like a sex worker, I at least deserve to be fairly compensated.

But have you considered that the reason you cant find a REAL SD is because you're not the type of SB they're looking for regardless of what you look like..?\n\nFor the most part, most REAL SD are looking for Sugar babies that are single, college aged or post college aged women with no husband or long term BF.\n\nMost REAL SD arent going to date someone with a husband, in a polyamorous marriage, or even with a longterm BF. Most real SD are looking for something more exclusive. \n\nSo once you take out the REAL SD, you're only meeting whats left in the bow., guys that are only in it for sex. For the most part, these men dont care if your married, poly, or in a longterm relationship of any sort.\n\nHow you come off, and what your intentions are, is also going to be factor on the type of men you attract. Personally my vetting process I can usually weed out women that solely focus on the monetary aspect, and not looking for the relationship aspect, and I know other SD's do this as well. So its quite possible, you come off solely focused on the money and not the relationship.",

That's terribly boring and there's never anything to talk about because they're never learning anything new or doing anything fun.\n\nBut it does kind of reinforce my decision not to look for an SR. Needy, clingy, demanding assholes are not people I want to have a relationship with. If a vanilla boyfriend acted that way - demanding my attention 20 hours a day (no, that was NOT an exaggeration), ordering me to take naked selfies in the bathroom at work to send to him, asking me to come over to have sex in his house (no dinner, no date, no nothing) twice a day - I would lose his number within 5 minutes.\n\nSo is it really all about the money? Well, if you're an unbearable, needy, demanding jerk, then yeah, I'm sure as hell not hanging out with you for free. And if you come into an SR with the attitude that you can do whatever tf you want and disrespect the SB just because you're the one with money, then you have no call to get pissy when you discover that she's just in it for the money.\n\nWhen you disrespect my TIME, you disrespect ME, and I don't tolerate it from anyone. Period. Schedule a M&G with me and then no-call, no-show? Lose my number and don't ever approach me again. Ask me to take time away from my PAYING job to tend to your fragile ego? Fuck off.

One of those guys, after the first M&G, was texting me 18-20 hours a day, demanding nudes from me at work, etc. Another guy came to the M&G and didn't even buy me coffee. Another came to the M&G and told me at the very beginning that he refused to EVER give cash (no PPM or allowance, regardless of how long we've been in an SR); that he would only \"buy me gifts\" from time to time when he felt like it (that, to me, is more of a \"spoiled girlfriend\" arrangement, which is not what I was looking for). The fourth guy basically ghosted me for a month, then tried to come back around and ask me out again. And 3 M&Gs that I scheduled pulled a no-call, no-show on the M&G itself.\n\nI try to remind myself that those are just the bad apples, but those were my first 7 experiences with sugaring and that's how it turned out. By contrast, one of my SW clients is a professional guy who visits me about once every 1-2 weeks, who I have friendly banter with between sessions, and who sometimes brings me gifts just because he was thinking of me. That's the third SW client I ever saw, and the other 2 (while they didn't become regular clients) were also very respectful and courteous.\n\nWhen \"Johns\" treat SWers better than SDs treat SBs, there's something rotten in the sugar bowl. :(",

She tolerates lots of generational differences. Just as I tend to think about how old the vanilla peers I occasionally date appear to me now, she must think the same way with me. In fact, she needs to \"warm up\" to me when we meet, usually once every 5-7 days. We don't get a portion of each other's cultural or historical references and we avoid politics, which I am pretty passionate about, just as she is about \"living her best life\" and having fun.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life, but in an LT SR, it has had ups and downs, no pun intended, just as most LT vanilla do. She admitted in the tenth month that she had been sleeping with a FWB, and I was also doing with a peer, whom she knew about. So I am unsurprised when people say that their SRs are not exclusive or they are not monogamous. Why wouldn't a hot young woman want a peer? \n\nAccepting this last reality took me a long time, but I was helped to it by reading the women on here write about the breadth of their approaches to their SDs. My fantasy and my justification for a generous amount of sugar asked me to think that she was \"more into\" our relationship than I think she could muster. After breaking off with a significant ex, and turning 21, she started sugaring. She never wanted to develop feelings for me, though she did, but never to the extent that I fantasized about, mimicking how close sex brings me to those who I really enjoy sleeping with. She is protecting her feelings and trying not to feel vulnerable. \n\nSRs are all different, and are moving targets as time changes the SB and SD, and the \"expiration date\" starts to be felt by one or the other.",

There is a tendency by some here to broadly classify any indoor arrangement as just escorting or money for sex, which may lead newer girls to avoid them for that reason alone.\n\nI completely agree with this 100%. One of my first sugar relationships was with someone I had a 20 year age gap, we had a very good mental and physical connection. All of our dates were indoors, and most were overnights. They included all of the things you mentioned in your post. She didnt really enjoy social settings (nothing to do with dating me, just her personality), so all of our dates were indoors. It never felt like an escort relationship. It was still very meaningful.",

I DO NOT HAVE TIME to text with you continually for 20 hours a day.\n\nHerein lies the problem. Please dont take this the wrong way. But have you considered that the reason you cant find a REAL SD is because you're not the type of SB they're looking for regardless of what you look like..?\n\nFor the most part, most REAL SD are looking for Sugar babies that are single, college aged or post college aged women with no husband or long term BF.\n\nMost REAL SD arent going to date someone with a husband, in a polyamorous marriage, or even with a longterm BF. Most real SD are looking for something more exclusive. \n\nSo once you take out the REAL SD, you're only meeting whats left in the bow., guys that are only in it for sex. For the most part, these men dont care if your married, poly, or in a longterm relationship of any sort.\n\nHow you come off, and what your intentions are, is also going to be factor on the type of men you attract. Personally my vetting process I can usually weed out women that solely focus on the monetary aspect, and not looking for the relationship aspect, and I know other SD's do this as well. So its quite possible, you come off solely focused on the money and not the relationship.",

Another came to the M&G and told me at the very beginning that he refused to EVER give cash (no PPM or allowance, regardless of how long we've been in an SR); that he would only \"buy me gifts\" from time to time when he felt like it (that, to me, is more of a \"spoiled girlfriend\" arrangement, which is not what I was looking for). The fourth guy basically ghosted me for a month, then tried to come back around and ask me out again. And 3 M&Gs that I scheduled pulled a no-call, no-show on the M&G itself.\n\nI try to remind myself that those are just the bad apples, but those were my first 7 experiences with sugaring and that's how it turned out. By contrast, one of my SW clients is a professional guy who visits me about once every 1-2 weeks, who I have friendly banter with between sessions, and who sometimes brings me gifts just because he was thinking of me. That's the third SW client I ever saw, and the other 2 (while they didn't become regular clients) were also very respectful and courteous.\n\nWhen \"Johns\" treat SWers better than SDs treat SBs, there's something rotten in the sugar bowl. :(",

In fact, she needs to \"warm up\" to me when we meet, usually once every 5-7 days. We don't get a portion of each other's cultural or historical references and we avoid politics, which I am pretty passionate about, just as she is about \"living her best life\" and having fun.\n\nWe have a pretty good sex life, but in an LT SR, it has had ups and downs, no pun intended, just as most LT vanilla do. She admitted in the tenth month that she had been sleeping with a FWB, and I was also doing with a peer, whom she knew about. So I am unsurprised when people say that their SRs are not exclusive or they are not monogamous. Why wouldn't a hot young woman want a peer? \n\nAccepting this last reality took me a long time, but I was helped to it by reading the women on here write about the breadth of their approaches to their SDs. My fantasy and my justification for a generous amount of sugar asked me to think that she was \"more into\" our relationship than I think she could muster. After breaking off with a significant ex, and turning 21, she started sugaring. She never wanted to develop feelings for me, though she did, but never to the extent that I fantasized about, mimicking how close sex brings me to those who I really enjoy sleeping with. She is protecting her feelings and trying not to feel vulnerable. \n\nSRs are all different, and are moving targets as time changes the SB and SD, and the \"expiration date\" starts to be felt by one or the other.",

Just that Ruphun likes to pretend he knows the \"true meaning of sugar relationships\" over and over again when he clearly doesn't. \n\nI get annoyed when anyone blanket statements. In Ruphun's example, he blankets anyone who doesn't fit *his* parameters as \"not knowing what a real SR is\". I get equally annoyed when SBs say \"no real SB in her right mind is going to have legitimate feelings for an SD\". The latter is an insult to me personally as well. Is my marriage a sham because it started off as an SR? Nope. Any stranger on the internet who wants to think otherwise about me personally can suck it \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

There is a tendency by some here to broadly classify any indoor arrangement as just escorting or money for sex, which may lead newer girls to avoid them for that reason alone.\n\nI completely agree with this 100%. One of my first sugar relationships was with someone I had a 20 year age gap, we had a very good mental and physical connection. All of our dates were indoors, and most were overnights. They included all of the things you mentioned in your post. She didnt really enjoy social settings (nothing to do with dating me, just her personality), so all of our dates were indoors. It never felt like an escort relationship. It was still very meaningful.",
