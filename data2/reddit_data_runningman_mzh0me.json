Though, if accumulated, they can be given a significant time for rest, even possible without the show having a hiatus. iirc as well, to give an example, 1n2d members met 2x a month for filming or so (since they also filmed 2 days consecutively equal to 2 episodes a filming week as well) hence a good intermittent rest between filming schedules. So, if RM filming is about 8 episodes a month, since we have 4 weeks every month, they could have about a whole month free. \n\nPlus, usually, for variety shows in Korea, a new season usually entails a change of cast members, concept/formatting, and/or location.  These also usually happen after a significant amount of time. (A good exception to this would be cooking and travel shows, which are usually aired on cable tv. The formatting thing could be really difficult for RM because they've established a sort of freeform(?)

They also don't pause any similar programs unless it's for a national reason (e.g. the Olympics or the Sewol tragedy) or for scandals (which usually ends up having a change of cast lineup). To add to that, ratings are a big thing for variety shows, having to pause a program could lead to significantly lower ratings on return and they wouldn't want to risk that, add to that the fact that their current ratings are usually below 10%, that would be an even bigger risk.\n\nAll in all, I guess it boils down to their culture and the decisions of upper management, the cast, and crew. I understand your good intentions, truly, but if we were to consider the consequences and the current situation, the show might get shelved for good, if ever they were to pause the show. Though, I do agree that a short hiatus would be good for the cast and crew. (In which case, I guess the cast have that, \"The show must go on\" mindset in order to keep it running.

If they only did half as many episodes, it'd still be a thrill.\n\nBut even if they did that, each of them are still working much of the rest of the week with other shows or dramas or concerts (pre-Pandemic), so it's not like they'd be getting full time off to recuperate.",

            "body": "iirc they generally film two episodes a week (mon & tues), so that's about 2 weeks full of content for one week of filming. This was to give the editing team enough time to edit each episode properly and to possibly accommodate anything else that may happen (like a canceled episode). Though, if accumulated, they can be given a significant time for rest, even possible without the show having a hiatus. iirc as well, to give an example, 1n2d members met 2x a month for filming or so (since they also filmed 2 days consecutively equal to 2 episodes a filming week as well) hence a good intermittent rest between filming schedules. So, if RM filming is about 8 episodes a month, since we have 4 weeks every month, they could have about a whole month free. \n\nPlus, usually, for variety shows in Korea, a new season usually entails a change of cast members, concept/formatting, and/or location.  These also usually happen after a significant amount of time. (A good exception to this would be cooking and travel shows, which are usually aired on cable tv. The formatting thing could be really difficult for RM because they've established a sort of freeform(?) Mafia game and team competition concept, feel free to correct me tho, it's hard to generalize these things...) They also don't pause any similar programs unless it's for a national reason (e.g. the Olympics or the Sewol tragedy) or for scandals (which usually ends up having a change of cast lineup). To add to that, ratings are a big thing for variety shows, having to pause a program could lead to significantly lower ratings on return and they wouldn't want to risk that, add to that the fact that their current ratings are usually below 10%, that would be an even bigger risk.\n\nAll in all, I guess it boils down to their culture and the decisions of upper management, the cast, and crew. I understand your good intentions, truly, but if we were to consider the consequences and the current situation, the show might get shelved for good, if ever they were to pause the show. Though, I do agree that a short hiatus would be good for the cast and crew. (In which case, I guess the cast have that, \"The show must go on\" mindset in order to keep it running. Truthfully though, I think part of the problem is that they're also mostly workaholics. XD)\n\nSorry for the length tho, I'm still working on my summary skills. :)",
