There isn't a single arc in Boruto that could hold a candle on even the worst arcs in Naruto (feel free to point an actual arc in Boruto that could stand on its own without Naruto).\n\nBoruto is shit because Kishimoto is a naturally shit writer. Samurai 8 and Boruto are proofs that when left alone Kishimoto is a horrible story teller even though he might have great raw ideas. If you've seen the early drafts of Naruto, it reeked all the same shits that made Boruto shit. Naruto was a success because Kosuke Yahagi reigned in Kishimoto's dumbest ideas and steered him to create a coherent story. \n\nEven today Naruto is still creating new fans, you can't say the same for Boruto whose manga sales are declining every volume because guess what, Boruto is fucking shit!",

It may have started that way but on its own Boruto is just no good. There were tons of endearing characters that created iconic moments in early Naruto like Haku, Zabuza, Gaara, or Lee strung along properly constructed arcs and well told stories in OG Naruto. Properly characterized and endearing casts along with great stories were what made Naruto a success. \n\nCan you really say the same about Boruto? on his own Boruto the character was nowhere near as interesting or endearing as kid Naruto. It's the same with every other characters who are basically a watered down, lamer version of their predecessors. How can you compare Kakashi and Konohamaru? what about Chocho and Choji? even Shikadai is a lot less interesting (and obviously less original) than Shikamaru. Boruto also don't have complex villains like Orochimaru, Gaara, or Kimimaro. Add all those factors with wacky power level and stuffs that just shit on the established power system or in-universe lores.\n\nYes a lot of people shit on Boruto because of the nerfs but it's also true that as a shonen work Boruto is inherently bad and just can't compare to modern shonen manga like MHA or even the less popular ones in current Jump like Yozakura Family or Undead Unluck. Boruto is not a \"hunk of junk that shouldn't even exist\" but let's be real, if Boruto the manga exists without Naruto it'd have been axed by WSJ a long time ago.",

While Naruto wss portayed to those of us who grew up in strict, militaristic styles of living due to conservative parents/grandparents as something we could relate to with their world being in war and the way of thinking needed for that world, Borutos is different. Its a time of peace from war, aka the current era irl. It is trying to appeal as much to the new as to the old, and its hard as most who are watching it are the ones judging it as its not anything like Naruto.

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

Literally two of them almost get overthrown and murdered by their own people and have to be saved by a group of freshly graduated genin. \n\nI mean I\u2019m not trying to wank Konahamaru or anything, but everyone is just weak af anymore. Anyone who isn\u2019t a main character has always been weak in general, but now Jonin are getting wiped like they\u2019re the low level Chunin from Naruto.

They were side characters but still they literally dedicated an arc for those guys. Lee had one of the best fights in Naruto & Shippuden. Choji and his dad were fighting the Gedo statue. Even a genin knows not to charge an enemy head on. These guys are 'Konoha's legendary 12'. They were fighting on the front lines in the war arc. The new gen respects them alot for that (Iwabe is a huge Might Gai fan). I don't get it why accepting this scene was cringe af and totally not required so hard to digest. Not to mention it wasn't in the manga..",

I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead.

There isn't a single arc in Boruto that could hold a candle on even the worst arcs in Naruto (feel free to point an actual arc in Boruto that could stand on its own without Naruto).\n\nBoruto is shit because Kishimoto is a naturally shit writer. Samurai 8 and Boruto are proofs that when left alone Kishimoto is a horrible story teller even though he might have great raw ideas. If you've seen the early drafts of Naruto, it reeked all the same shits that made Boruto shit. Naruto was a success because Kosuke Yahagi reigned in Kishimoto's dumbest ideas and steered him to create a coherent story. \n\nEven today Naruto is still creating new fans, you can't say the same for Boruto whose manga sales are declining every volume because guess what, Boruto is fucking shit!",

It may have started that way but on its own Boruto is just no good. There were tons of endearing characters that created iconic moments in early Naruto like Haku, Zabuza, Gaara, or Lee strung along properly constructed arcs and well told stories in OG Naruto. Properly characterized and endearing casts along with great stories were what made Naruto a success. \n\nCan you really say the same about Boruto? on his own Boruto the character was nowhere near as interesting or endearing as kid Naruto. It's the same with every other characters who are basically a watered down, lamer version of their predecessors. How can you compare Kakashi and Konohamaru? what about Chocho and Choji? even Shikadai is a lot less interesting (and obviously less original) than Shikamaru. Boruto also don't have complex villains like Orochimaru, Gaara, or Kimimaro. Add all those factors with wacky power level and stuffs that just shit on the established power system or in-universe lores.\n\nYes a lot of people shit on Boruto because of the nerfs but it's also true that as a shonen work Boruto is inherently bad and just can't compare to modern shonen manga like MHA or even the less popular ones in current Jump like Yozakura Family or Undead Unluck. Boruto is not a \"hunk of junk that shouldn't even exist\" but let's be real, if Boruto the manga exists without Naruto it'd have been axed by WSJ a long time ago.",

While Naruto wss portayed to those of us who grew up in strict, militaristic styles of living due to conservative parents/grandparents as something we could relate to with their world being in war and the way of thinking needed for that world, Borutos is different. Its a time of peace from war, aka the current era irl. It is trying to appeal as much to the new as to the old, and its hard as most who are watching it are the ones judging it as its not anything like Naruto.

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

Even a genin knows not to charge an enemy head on. These guys are 'Konoha's legendary 12'. They were fighting on the front lines in the war arc.

Have fun here.\n\n2.) I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

There isn't a single arc in Boruto that could hold a candle on even the worst arcs in Naruto (feel free to point an actual arc in Boruto that could stand on its own without Naruto).\n\nBoruto is shit because Kishimoto is a naturally shit writer. Samurai 8 and Boruto are proofs that when left alone Kishimoto is a horrible story teller even though he might have great raw ideas. If you've seen the early drafts of Naruto, it reeked all the same shits that made Boruto shit. Naruto was a success because Kosuke Yahagi reigned in Kishimoto's dumbest ideas and steered him to create a coherent story. \n\nEven today Naruto is still creating new fans, you can't say the same for Boruto whose manga sales are declining every volume because guess what, Boruto is fucking shit!",

Stop dwelling on how things were and watch with a new perspective.  Makes it all the better. Is it some majestic anime that trancends all others? No. But is it a hunk of junk that shouldnt even exist? Also no. Get your heads out of your asses and realize that Boruto isnt some garbage heap of an anime that yall think it is, and thats coming from one of the biggest Naruto advocates there are.

There were tons of endearing characters that created iconic moments in early Naruto like Haku, Zabuza, Gaara, or Lee strung along properly constructed arcs and well told stories in OG Naruto. Properly characterized and endearing casts along with great stories were what made Naruto a success. \n\nCan you really say the same about Boruto? on his own Boruto the character was nowhere near as interesting or endearing as kid Naruto. It's the same with every other characters who are basically a watered down, lamer version of their predecessors. How can you compare Kakashi and Konohamaru? what about Chocho and Choji? even Shikadai is a lot less interesting (and obviously less original) than Shikamaru. Boruto also don't have complex villains like Orochimaru, Gaara, or Kimimaro. Add all those factors with wacky power level and stuffs that just shit on the established power system or in-universe lores.\n\nYes a lot of people shit on Boruto because of the nerfs but it's also true that as a shonen work Boruto is inherently bad and just can't compare to modern shonen manga like MHA or even the less popular ones in current Jump like Yozakura Family or Undead Unluck. Boruto is not a \"hunk of junk that shouldn't even exist\" but let's be real, if Boruto the manga exists without Naruto it'd have been axed by WSJ a long time ago.",

While Naruto wss portayed to those of us who grew up in strict, militaristic styles of living due to conservative parents/grandparents as something we could relate to with their world being in war and the way of thinking needed for that world, Borutos is different. Its a time of peace from war, aka the current era irl. It is trying to appeal as much to the new as to the old, and its hard as most who are watching it are the ones judging it as its not anything like Naruto.

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

They were side characters but still they literally dedicated an arc for those guys. Lee had one of the best fights in Naruto & Shippuden. Choji and his dad were fighting the Gedo statue. Even a genin knows not to charge an enemy head on. These guys are 'Konoha's legendary 12'. They were fighting on the front lines in the war arc. The new gen respects them alot for that (Iwabe is a huge Might Gai fan). I don't get it why accepting this scene was cringe af and totally not required so hard to digest. Not to mention it wasn't in the manga..",

I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

There were tons of endearing characters that created iconic moments in early Naruto like Haku, Zabuza, Gaara, or Lee strung along properly constructed arcs and well told stories in OG Naruto. Properly characterized and endearing casts along with great stories were what made Naruto a success. \n\nCan you really say the same about Boruto? on his own Boruto the character was nowhere near as interesting or endearing as kid Naruto. It's the same with every other characters who are basically a watered down, lamer version of their predecessors. How can you compare Kakashi and Konohamaru? what about Chocho and Choji? even Shikadai is a lot less interesting (and obviously less original) than Shikamaru. Boruto also don't have complex villains like Orochimaru, Gaara, or Kimimaro. Add all those factors with wacky power level and stuffs that just shit on the established power system or in-universe lores.\n\nYes a lot of people shit on Boruto because of the nerfs but it's also true that as a shonen work Boruto is inherently bad and just can't compare to modern shonen manga like MHA or even the less popular ones in current Jump like Yozakura Family or Undead Unluck. Boruto is not a \"hunk of junk that shouldn't even exist\" but let's be real, if Boruto the manga exists without Naruto it'd have been axed by WSJ a long time ago.",

Its a time of peace from war, aka the current era irl. It is trying to appeal as much to the new as to the old, and its hard as most who are watching it are the ones judging it as its not anything like Naruto.

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

Even a genin knows not to charge an enemy head on. These guys are 'Konoha's legendary 12'. They were fighting on the front lines in the war arc. The new gen respects them alot for that (Iwabe is a huge Might Gai fan). I don't get it why accepting this scene was cringe af and totally not required so hard to digest. Not to mention it wasn't in the manga..",

I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead.

There were tons of endearing characters that created iconic moments in early Naruto like Haku, Zabuza, Gaara, or Lee strung along properly constructed arcs and well told stories in OG Naruto. Properly characterized and endearing casts along with great stories were what made Naruto a success. \n\nCan you really say the same about Boruto? on his own Boruto the character was nowhere near as interesting or endearing as kid Naruto. It's the same with every other characters who are basically a watered down, lamer version of their predecessors. How can you compare Kakashi and Konohamaru? what about Chocho and Choji? even Shikadai is a lot less interesting (and obviously less original) than Shikamaru. Boruto also don't have complex villains like Orochimaru, Gaara, or Kimimaro. Add all those factors with wacky power level and stuffs that just shit on the established power system or in-universe lores.\n\nYes a lot of people shit on Boruto because of the nerfs but it's also true that as a shonen work Boruto is inherently bad and just can't compare to modern shonen manga like MHA or even the less popular ones in current Jump like Yozakura Family or Undead Unluck. Boruto is not a \"hunk of junk that shouldn't even exist\" but let's be real, if Boruto the manga exists without Naruto it'd have been axed by WSJ a long time ago.",

While Naruto wss portayed to those of us who grew up in strict, militaristic styles of living due to conservative parents/grandparents as something we could relate to with their world being in war and the way of thinking needed for that world, Borutos is different. Its a time of peace from war, aka the current era irl. It is trying to appeal as much to the new as to the old, and its hard as most who are watching it are the ones judging it as its not anything like Naruto. So you need a new pair of eyes to watch Boruto.",

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

Even a genin knows not to charge an enemy head on. These guys are 'Konoha's legendary 12'. They were fighting on the front lines in the war arc. The new gen respects them alot for that (Iwabe is a huge Might Gai fan). I don't get it why accepting this scene was cringe af and totally not required so hard to digest. Not to mention it wasn't in the manga..",

I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

While Naruto wss portayed to those of us who grew up in strict, militaristic styles of living due to conservative parents/grandparents as something we could relate to with their world being in war and the way of thinking needed for that world, Borutos is different. Its a time of peace from war, aka the current era irl. It is trying to appeal as much to the new as to the old, and its hard as most who are watching it are the ones judging it as its not anything like Naruto. So you need a new pair of eyes to watch Boruto.",

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

I mean do people identified with Dragon Ball and One Piece because we had a bunch of aliens attacking Earth or pirates sailing the world's seas? the US has literally just ended the war in Afghanistan, the Yemen war is still ongoing, there's a civil war in Myanmar, and wars have never stopped in Africa (see the Tigray conflict or the current armed insurgency in Chad). I've no idea why you think the current era is peaceful. \n\nIronically when Naruto first started in 1999 there wasn't any major war at that time since the US didn't invade Iraq until 2001 so the idea that Naruto became popular because readers identified with wars is just absurd. At that time Naruto has already exploded in popularity due to Zabuza and Chuunin exam arc. All that during a relatively peaceful time in our world.\n\nEven if I don't judge Boruto by comparing it to Naruto, all those factors I mentioned before (characters and writing) are already enough to put Boruto among the bottom tier of shonen manga. You can't just blame Boruto's low popularity due to Naruto's older fans complaining. If Boruto can't retain Naruto's older fans then it should be able to gain new younger fans, the problem is Boruto can't do that either because it's just not that good compared to other shonen manga like JJK or Black Clover (which is ironically a Naruto rip off).",

Literally two of them almost get overthrown and murdered by their own people and have to be saved by a group of freshly graduated genin. \n\nI mean I\u2019m not trying to wank Konahamaru or anything, but everyone is just weak af anymore. Anyone who isn\u2019t a main character has always been weak in general, but now Jonin are getting wiped like they\u2019re the low level Chunin from Naruto.

I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead.

I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.)

I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

I never said that Naruto was flawless did you even read what I said?\n\n3.) Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",

Again, I like Naruto. It's not my favourite, because it has a lot of flaws. I like Boruto, but it too also has a lot of flaws. I'm not trying to say it's better, I'm just saying it's not as bad as most people think it is, and in fact has some great moments. Boruto picked up the mess Naruto made and tried to make a sequel out of it, and I personally think they executed it pretty well, obviously not perfect.\n\n4.) If you wanna know my favourite anime, it's HxH, favourite manga is Record of Ragnarok. I don't particularly care what you think of either, so if you're gonna insult my taste and opinion, go ahead. I personally do not care what a rando on the internet thinks of something I like and you shouldn't either lol.",
