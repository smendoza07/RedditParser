Perhaps because I've been burned more than a few times, where a POT's pics were *way* prettier than she was in real life.  I find myself constantly glancing out the front window as women are walking towards the front door and thinking, \"damn, that could be her, if her pics were 10 years old and 15 pounds ago\" or whatever.  Or maybe I just suck at identifying someone from their pics, because sometimes a pretty girl walks in, I think it's her, get all excited, and then as she gets closer I realize \"oh, not her\".\n\nIn short, u/Hphphp2 , I didn't doubt this part at all... I completely go through that same exercise your SD did.  \"oh shit I hope that's not her. ... OMG hope that's not her... oh man oh man  hope that's her!\"",

Perhaps because I've been burned more than a few times, where a POT's pics were *way* prettier than she was in real life.  I find myself constantly glancing out the front window as women are walking towards the front door and thinking, \"damn, that could be her, if her pics were 10 years old and 15 pounds ago\" or whatever.  Or maybe I just suck at identifying someone from their pics, because sometimes a pretty girl walks in, I think it's her, get all excited, and then as she gets closer I realize \"oh, not her\".\n\nIn short, u/Hphphp2 , I didn't doubt this part at all... I completely go through that same exercise your SD did.  \"oh shit I hope that's not her. ... OMG hope that's not her... oh man oh man  hope that's her!\"",
