    "body": "We (wife and I) went to a party that had about 50 people. And she was there with her BF. I saw her for 8 months or so in 2016. She saw me looking at her way a few times but kept her cool. I was a little worried initially that she would say something. But it was fine. And we spent entire night never having to talk to each other or talk to each other\u2019s SO. \n\nI feel relieved that there was no drama. This is why it\u2019s important to end things well. \n\nAnyone have similar story?",

It was a last minute trip, we were staying at the winery, so I took a bit longer getting ready and my SD went down to the tasting. I have to admit, I put extra effort to look amazing for him so it took some time. My SD had to make small talk with a couple for about 30 minutes. When I came down, I looked amazing. I remember him smiling then seeing my parents sitting with him. I almost died. My SD met my real dad, thank god my SD said that we had just met and that I was amazing and that I was in school, etc. Nothing but sweet things. My heart stopped when I first saw them. We had an absolute great time, but I had a ton of explaining to do later to my parents. Funniest thing was that they were not staying at the vineyard and my mom wanted to see the room. (My mom loved him, my dad was annoyed but he was such an improvement from anyone I had ever brought home before.) Funny thing was, that if I had just been paying attention my sister said she told me about my parents mini-vacation.",

Something like, \"they think I am a escort\". My parents were only thinking I lied to them because he was so much older. My mom saw the attraction right away. My dad was probably thinking, what all dad's think. \n\nMy SD was so thankful that he didn't say anything stupid trying to be cute, before I came down. \n\nThe tasting went as smooth as you could imagine. There wasn't much we could do. We actually had a great night once we were alone. It was a constant joke. However, we did only stay the night, not the extra day. He was extremely uncomfortable with the thought of running into them again. It wasn't exactly the romantic night he had in mind.",

We went to look at a big Christmas light at a church and ended up in line right behind my current (at the time SB),  her twin daughters and her new boyfriend (that I didn\u2019t know existed).   Her daughters had met me a few times before so I was concerned.  I had a heavy jacket and beanie so I could hide a bit and didn\u2019t talk much so they didn\u2019t hear my voice.  My wife was all worked up over me being quiet and having a bad attitude because I\u2019m usually a talker.   The poor SB was terrified her daughters would say something and/or that I was pissed about the boyfriend.  I wasn\u2019t.  \n\n3.  An ex SB started working in the kids center at my gym.  She was very cool and never made it weird.",

Apparently my doppelganger and a lady he was with was there. She questioned him about it, as she has met my soon to be ex wife. He explained it away and later asked if I was there. Ironically enough I had never been to that Italian Restaurant before. I've been twice now since then, but not then. \n\nAt that point I wasn't seeing anyone sugar. Things with an SB had just ended, things with my first SGF had ended, had yet to meet another POT, and then meet my current sGF about a month later. My SIL also swears there is someone around town who looks like me. So I guess there is. \n\nThis best friend knows about this, knows most of it and has for years. His wife does not. Our other mutual best friend has slipped up a few times and texted him about me being down over something she has done or going on in her life or whatever. His wife reads his texts. Sort of thankfully (as I don't want to lose a best friend over this) my soon to be ex-wife and sGF have somewhat similar sounding names, but different names. He explained it away as a typo last time.\n\nNever had anything remotely close to this happen. Then again everyone knows about my sGF (minus the soon to be ex-wife and my best friend's wife). I doubt I'd ever run in to ex-SB, but she was nuts anyway and tried extorting me. It may be possible to run in to the first ex-SGF, but we are sort of friends albeit don't talk? She also knows about this sGF. \n\nHAVE come very close to running in to the wife a few times in this lifestyle. One time she got out early from work, my ex-SGF had parked at my place and we had gone together an hour or so away on a mini-daycation. Came back and saw wife pull in as I did. Thankfully big parking lot, and had just started to park. So I moved to the other end and waited for her to go inside. Once she did, quick good bye and that was that.",
