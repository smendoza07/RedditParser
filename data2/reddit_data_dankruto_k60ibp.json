There's demand for it, so the animation studios make it. Regardless of whether the original story writters or directors are involved. Like in Boruto (until recently) and DB GT. \n\nHell they're probably making millions out of these continuations, regardless of whether people like it or not. There's demand, and animation nowadays is cheap and simplistic (and ugly as well but that's a separate discussion). What reasons do they have not to do them? It's a bussiness after all. \n\nNow, is Boruto good? Separate discussion and kinda controversial. Let's stay away from that one.",

You stay because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I mean, you gotta eat and make rent but you could do that doing just about anything. \n\nI know it\u2019s cheesy, but like the one episode in the early days...when Shikamaru and his dad have the convo after the failed Sasuke mission? \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, someone else will have to.\u201d In this regards, seeing Naruto stick with it in Boruto, to me is him working hard- trying to make the village a better place, even if he learned it wasn\u2019t initially what he thought it would be. Just another testament of his character for never giving up and believing. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to encourage people to stay in a shitty job/ work environment. Just saying how Naruto still inspires me in Boruto to keep on keeping on.",

Sarutobi fought during the 2nd Great Shinobi War and had a rough childhood, Minato also fought during the 2nd War, as did Tsunade and she also watched those she loved die in battle, its an entire arch for her as to why would freeze at the sight of blood despite being a medical ninja. We all know the crap Kakashi went through being a child soldier in the 2nd war as a Jounin, having to watch Obito die and have his eye removed so the Sharingan could be put in and this was after his father disgraced the Hatake name and having to kill Rin. Then we know all about Naruto's past. So yes, by definition and by a clear pattern, we know that every single Hokage has had a traumatic childhood. \n\nNaruto himself admitted it felt like the entire world hated him and that he could have easily ended up like Gara during the Assault on the Leaf Arc. His entire world hated him, but I suppose clarity would have helped on that point. \n\nYou'll have to forgive me if the introduction to the character makes him a pisspoor fan fiction character rebuilt with all of the same crap that made Naruto a compelling character tweaked just enough for him to seem original when he's a watered down undercut of a character.",

But sometimes, only after you get the dream you realize how shitty/ hard it is. Or it gets a lot worse I guess? But you don\u2019t stay because the job is easy or lucrative. You stay because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I mean, you gotta eat and make rent but you could do that doing just about anything. \n\nI know it\u2019s cheesy, but like the one episode in the early days...when Shikamaru and his dad have the convo after the failed Sasuke mission? \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, someone else will have to.\u201d In this regards, seeing Naruto stick with it in Boruto, to me is him working hard- trying to make the village a better place, even if he learned it wasn\u2019t initially what he thought it would be. Just another testament of his character for never giving up and believing. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to encourage people to stay in a shitty job/ work environment. Just saying how Naruto still inspires me in Boruto to keep on keeping on.",

The anime has adapted barely any of the post movie content and the one arc they did (Mujina gang) is the most boring one so people have been judging the manga based on sidequest stuff original to the anime. Once the real stuff starts getting animated, I think opinion on Boruto might start to shift.",

We all know the crap Kakashi went through being a child soldier in the 2nd war as a Jounin, having to watch Obito die and have his eye removed so the Sharingan could be put in and this was after his father disgraced the Hatake name and having to kill Rin. Then we know all about Naruto's past. So yes, by definition and by a clear pattern, we know that every single Hokage has had a traumatic childhood. \n\nNaruto himself admitted it felt like the entire world hated him and that he could have easily ended up like Gara during the Assault on the Leaf Arc. His entire world hated him, but I suppose clarity would have helped on that point. \n\nYou'll have to forgive me if the introduction to the character makes him a pisspoor fan fiction character rebuilt with all of the same crap that made Naruto a compelling character tweaked just enough for him to seem original when he's a watered down undercut of a character.",

Both of them end up literally stronger than every other village combined. \n\nFire country elder - \"No Naruto, you can't enact this technology trade between lands!

Sarutobi fought during the 2nd Great Shinobi War and had a rough childhood, Minato also fought during the 2nd War, as did Tsunade and she also watched those she loved die in battle, its an entire arch for her as to why would freeze at the sight of blood despite being a medical ninja. We all know the crap Kakashi went through being a child soldier in the 2nd war as a Jounin, having to watch Obito die and have his eye removed so the Sharingan could be put in and this was after his father disgraced the Hatake name and having to kill Rin. Then we know all about Naruto's past. So yes, by definition and by a clear pattern, we know that every single Hokage has had a traumatic childhood. \n\nNaruto himself admitted it felt like the entire world hated him and that he could have easily ended up like Gara during the Assault on the Leaf Arc. His entire world hated him, but I suppose clarity would have helped on that point. \n\nYou'll have to forgive me if the introduction to the character makes him a pisspoor fan fiction character rebuilt with all of the same crap that made Naruto a compelling character tweaked just enough for him to seem original when he's a watered down undercut of a character.",

Sarutobi fought during the 2nd Great Shinobi War and had a rough childhood, Minato also fought during the 2nd War, as did Tsunade and she also watched those she loved die in battle, its an entire arch for her as to why would freeze at the sight of blood despite being a medical ninja. We all know the crap Kakashi went through being a child soldier in the 2nd war as a Jounin, having to watch Obito die and have his eye removed so the Sharingan could be put in and this was after his father disgraced the Hatake name and having to kill Rin. Then we know all about Naruto's past. So yes, by definition and by a clear pattern, we know that every single Hokage has had a traumatic childhood. \n\nNaruto himself admitted it felt like the entire world hated him and that he could have easily ended up like Gara during the Assault on the Leaf Arc. His entire world hated him, but I suppose clarity would have helped on that point. \n\nYou'll have to forgive me if the introduction to the character makes him a pisspoor fan fiction character rebuilt with all of the same crap that made Naruto a compelling character tweaked just enough for him to seem original when he's a watered down undercut of a character.",

We all know the crap Kakashi went through being a child soldier in the 2nd war as a Jounin, having to watch Obito die and have his eye removed so the Sharingan could be put in and this was after his father disgraced the Hatake name and having to kill Rin. Then we know all about Naruto's past. So yes, by definition and by a clear pattern, we know that every single Hokage has had a traumatic childhood. \n\nNaruto himself admitted it felt like the entire world hated him and that he could have easily ended up like Gara during the Assault on the Leaf Arc. His entire world hated him, but I suppose clarity would have helped on that point. \n\nYou'll have to forgive me if the introduction to the character makes him a pisspoor fan fiction character rebuilt with all of the same crap that made Naruto a compelling character tweaked just enough for him to seem original when he's a watered down undercut of a character.",

Where Konahamaru and Iruka still teach, and you expect me to believe they wouldn't even MENTION how and where he started and where he ended up? He was Genin that had surpassed every other Hokage tbrough dedication to becoming the best ninja possible but he started out as an attention seeking runt who couldn't even do a basic clone jutsu and you think that would inspire academy students? You expect me to believe that Hinata would never talk about her husband with her kids? \n\nOh, and you know the whole history? Funny how you tried to be condescending and imply that the other Hokages didn't have traumatic lives when that is categorically untrue.\n\nNah.",
