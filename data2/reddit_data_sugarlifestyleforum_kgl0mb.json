    "body": "I got an email yesterday that made me very happy! My first-ever SB, with whom I was together for about a year, seems set for life\u2026 and I had a lot to do with it!\n\nAt the time, I had been dabbling with Bitcoin, and after mentioning it to her, she became interested\u2026 to the extent I paid her with Bitcoin here and there. Just minimal amounts, for fun, but Bitcoin wasn\u2019t worth anywhere near what it\u2019s worth today. But just for fun, when I was to give her 3k, 500 of it would be in Bitcoin. Actually, on one occasion, I remember giving her 4 Bitcoins for the whole 3k, so I guess Bitcoin was around $750 at the time. This would\u2019ve been mid-to-late 2016.\n\nAnyway, she went off to grad school in Europe, but we\u2019ve swapped emails here and there. A couple of years ago, she sent me a frantic email that she\u2019d lost her phone, and all the Bitcoins she had were on it. No worries, I helped her recover them; I\u2019d kept all the account recovery info, and was surprised that she had so many. Just over 40. To some extent I guess it was a blessing she wasn\u2019t really \u201cinto it\u201d. I\u2019d told her to just keep them and forget about them, and in a decade or two they might be worth something. Great, because she didn\u2019t know how to sell them even if she wanted to. And so I just explained to her how to get them off the phone and put them somewhere safe.\n\nSo, she emails me yesterday and tells me that she sold some Bitcoin over the summer, bought a house and two apartments (!)\u2026 and last week sold the rest of the Bitcoin in preparation of also selling the house and then buying the whole apartment building of 18 units, each of which rents for 1600 Euros a month.\n\nFrom SB to a Masters in finance to property manager. I\u2019m really happy for her and happy I had something to do with it. And I\u2019m sure I have a free place to stay if I ever visit Tilburg!",
