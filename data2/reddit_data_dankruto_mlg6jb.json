He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the shinobi that attacked him when he gave him water. As bad as it sounds it\u2019s good and bad parenting all together.

He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the shinobi that attacked him when he gave him water. As bad as it sounds it\u2019s good and bad parenting all together.

He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the shinobi that attacked him when he gave him water. As bad as it sounds it\u2019s good and bad parenting all together.

Honestly as bad as that sounds at the time it makes sense and in fugakus place I completely understand. Throughout that entire sequence we see itachi thinking and wondering about the meaning of life and war. Probably did it to mature him and it was clear that itachi was no slouch too. He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the shinobi that attacked him when he gave him water. As bad as it sounds it\u2019s good and bad parenting all together.

Honestly as bad as that sounds at the time it makes sense and in fugakus place I completely understand. Throughout that entire sequence we see itachi thinking and wondering about the meaning of life and war. Probably did it to mature him and it was clear that itachi was no slouch too. He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the shinobi that attacked him when he gave him water. As bad as it sounds it\u2019s good and bad parenting all together. Good for growth and understanding and bad bc ur bringing ur kid to a battlefield full of death and blood lmao.",

Honestly as bad as that sounds at the time it makes sense and in fugakus place I completely understand. Throughout that entire sequence we see itachi thinking and wondering about the meaning of life and war. Probably did it to mature him and it was clear that itachi was no slouch too. He didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the shinobi that attacked him when he gave him water. As bad as it sounds it\u2019s good and bad parenting all together. Good for growth and understanding and bad bc ur bringing ur kid to a battlefield full of death and blood lmao.",
