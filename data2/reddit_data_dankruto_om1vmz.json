I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era.

Her tale (including the alien part) derives from [The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter). And while it's true Kaguya could've gotten a more interesting character, it's probable Kishi didn't forget giving her character, since he makes Naruto explicitly mention how she didn't have a [proper personality.](https://gyazo.com/b587cff10035b604dc0084fb87ace23f)",

Maybe Sasuke does come back to the village after killing Orochimaru before setting out to kill Itachi. Maybe some of the konoha 11 actually turn rogue, not just Sasuke!   \n\n\nI would also love a proper telling of Indra/Ashura and Sage of the six paths, I love that type of prophetic and ascetic storytelling, and thought the filler arc with Indra/Ashura was decently entertaining!",

But you cant outright say that I am wrong . I will provide a little more context as to why I am finding it average . First of all , unlike Akatsuki , where I liked almost every member of their organization I am not interested by any members of the Kara so far except Koji and Jigen/Isshiki . Delta is annoying , we know very little about Code as of now , Deepa was boring , Victor was boring and Boro seems okayish so far . The way Deepa was defeated was really underwhelming for me . I am really loving Kawaki's character so far though . I like him more than Boruto . Delta Vs Naruto was really underwhelming . I am ok with the fact that Naruto didnt use big jutsus out there but why didn't he used Shadow clones was beyond my understanding . Sasuke and Naruto Vs Jigen episode was the peak of this arc imo even though Sasuke and Naruto were clapped . This is all I have to say for now . Maybe my opinion will change once the arc is completed but it has been pretty average so far .",

I really think Boruto would be much cooler if there were a couple baddies running around with sharingan. Killing them all off was kind of lame. But I was saying I do like the idea that the Otsusuki can imbed themselves into humans and slowly take over. Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

Let's all be honest everyone in the Naruto era had a fucked up life. In Boruto everyone is peaceful after wars except some people. It's like predator vs prey . The prey being humans and the predators being the otsutsukis. At the end of Shippuden it was revealed that Naruto was the child of prophecy and the reincarnation of Ashura which means he had good destiny. When momoshiki saw Boruto fate in the manga even he felt pity. So yeah it's gonna be sad when this series turns dark and why the fuck Kawaki betrays Naruto. I will give the Boruto anime 6.5/10 or 7/10",

We can see the entire early Uchiha clan, Kagami Uchiha who was also a student of Tobirama. We get to see all 3 great ninja wars. Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru when they were genin. It would be great. We can see Ohnoki, Third Raikage. So many characters, and Hiruzen was alive for them all.",

With Jigen and all the extra Ootsutsuki bullshit, shinobi and the villages in general are so completely irrelevant at this point that they might as well all be useless civilians.\n\nIt has become Dragonball in the sense that nothing matters besides what's directly happening to this very select group of characters and that's it. For a world like Naruto's that had so much interesting world building previously, it's a massive dip in quality and imo interesting story telling in general. There are countless other criticisms as well, like how every one and their fucking mother can absorb chakra making most jutsu useless now, or how all these new kids can skip handseals and learn techniques almost instantly, etc etc. The entire series is the most stereotypical example of a sequel being made for no reason other than milking a cash cow for merchandise. If people enjoy it that's fine, but I think calling it a \"great series\" especially when compared to the original, which had its own problems, is not a very accurate assessment at all.",

Only 2 otsutsuki\u2019s have been shown and then otsutsuki where brought up in Naruto Boruto has no choice but to solve this and its been pretty much cleared up with some plot points here and there still needing to be filled there isn\u2019t any real power creeps all the cyborgs have been shown to have a clear weakness and limitations I agree that the side characters are rather irrelevant so I agree on that point barely anyone in Boruto can actually absorb chakra the only people shown so far is delta which had clear limitations Ao which had even clearer limitations Momoshiki, Isshiki, Boruto and Kawaki that\u2019s it and a good majority of these people have just barely been introduced so saying everyone can absorbed ninjutsu is honestly false none of the kids have skipped hand seals hand seals are still very relevant in Boruto Sarada just used hand seals when using chidori last episode and no one wants y\u2019all to call it a great anime we are just tired of y\u2019all talking shit if y\u2019all don\u2019t like it stfu and go rewatch naruto otherwise yalls complaints are falling on death ears and y\u2019all only do it to make y\u2019all selves feel better",

Sorry buddy, that's called character assassination for the sake of plot progression, something good authors do not do.\n\n> there isn\u2019t any real power creeps all the cyborgs have been shown to have a clear weakness and limitations\n\nDelta was shown fighting at S-rank taijutsu levels for a prolonged period of time, and she can also absorb and fire back jutsu. Whatever \"limitations\" they have don't mean shit, she is now automatically stronger than 99.9% of all Shinobi to have ever existed.\n\nThe sheer fact that you think there isn't power creep when the most recent villain just fought Naruto and Sasuke, 2 characters that already made most of the world irrelevant by the end of Shippuden, and wiped the floor with them is so laughable I'm inclined to believe you never even watched the original series to begin with. Jigen could waltz through the entire Shinobi world and instantly kill everyone. None of the villages matter, none of the Kage matter, none of their alliances or jutsus or bloodlines or *anything* matters. It's like dropping Superman into Game of Thrones. Congrats, he automatically beats everything and nothing matters, what an interesting story. Now we have to invent a bunch of new bullshit with Boruto and gang that's even stronger than things we've seen previously to deal with this new threat, that's called power creep.\n\nAnyone who has paid even an ounce of attention throughout the series can spot the glaring flaws and inconsistencies found within Boruto. Any good author could have worked around the issues in the series, like having the sequel take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or super old for example so you don't have to nerf them/make shit even stronger than them (again, avoiding power creep). Though seeing as you type like a 14 year old on a twitter rant (it's 'deaf' ears btw, not 'death' ears), I'm not surprised you enjoy the low effort garbage they keep putting out and seem to know very little about the original series in general. You're their target audience at this point I suppose, so good for them on the easy money.",

What where y\u2019all defenses for Naruto, he\u2019s the Hokage, he doesn\u2019t have a father to learn from, Naruto can\u2019t use clones in the Hokages office, naruto never learned how to be a good father etc where are all these excuses y\u2019all had for Naruto now it\u2019s just Narutos character was butchered Narutos character wasn\u2019t assassinated Naruto and Boruto\u2019s relationship was a parallel of Kishimoto and his sons relationship it was to show how Naruto and Kishimoto sometimes out their dream/job above their family sometimes and unintentionally hurt then yet they later on learn and grow from. I swear when the Naruto delta fight came out y\u2019all swore up and down Naruto was holding back some Imma throw that right back at you Naruto was holding back as well as fighting near the village and kids so he obviously couldn\u2019t use high lvl justus and again Delta had clear limitations if she absorbed to much chakra she would overload which she did and as I said she was fighting a held back and suppressed Naruto and I know there is a power creep but not any real ones the most recent villain is also an otsutsuki which have been shown to be the strongest beings in the whole Naruto verse yalls problem is y\u2019all want naruto and sasuke to always win and always be the strongest take your bias out of your judgment and you\u2019d actually enjoy Boruto until then you can continue to hate on it I\u2019ve watched the original and I also know there where already crazy powerful people in naruto before Boruto even came Along Kaguya, Madara, and the most wanked character of all Hagaromo it\u2019s not like dropping Superman in game of thrones because Naruto and Sasuke where still able to hold their own in the battle and they are still 2 of the strongest people in the shinobi world and nice insult my guy you can\u2019t bring up any good points so you opt to insults very classy and your complaining about 2 characters that have just barely been introduced to the story so this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s been going on for a long time only a month or 2 at most which leads me to believe y\u2019all find anything to complain about y\u2019all weren\u2019t complaining when Naruto and sasuke beat up Momoshiki",

I also never \"made excuses\" for Naruto and again, criticizing Naruto's actions within Boruto is a critique of the show, Boruto, since it does not align with how he is portrayed in the original series.\n\nFeel free to continue watching and enjoying Boruto by all means, as I said people who pay very little attention and don't care about lazy/inconsistent writing such as yourself are 100% their target audience at this point, so mostly kids.",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

Her tale (including the alien part) derives from [The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter). And while it's true Kaguya could've gotten a more interesting character, it's probable Kishi didn't forget giving her character, since he makes Naruto explicitly mention how she didn't have a [proper personality.](https://gyazo.com/b587cff10035b604dc0084fb87ace23f)",

Maybe characters like Lee and Neji could get greater importance in the part 2, maybe Tobi wouldn't be Obito but actually just a weird incomplete version of Madara, just his one eye and the rest being some disgusting shit. Maybe Sasuke does come back to the village after killing Orochimaru before setting out to kill Itachi. Maybe some of the konoha 11 actually turn rogue, not just Sasuke!   \n\n\nI would also love a proper telling of Indra/Ashura and Sage of the six paths, I love that type of prophetic and ascetic storytelling, and thought the filler arc with Indra/Ashura was decently entertaining!",

But you cant outright say that I am wrong . I will provide a little more context as to why I am finding it average . First of all , unlike Akatsuki , where I liked almost every member of their organization I am not interested by any members of the Kara so far except Koji and Jigen/Isshiki . Delta is annoying , we know very little about Code as of now , Deepa was boring , Victor was boring and Boro seems okayish so far . The way Deepa was defeated was really underwhelming for me . I am really loving Kawaki's character so far though . I like him more than Boruto . Delta Vs Naruto was really underwhelming . I am ok with the fact that Naruto didnt use big jutsus out there but why didn't he used Shadow clones was beyond my understanding . Sasuke and Naruto Vs Jigen episode was the peak of this arc imo even though Sasuke and Naruto were clapped . This is all I have to say for now . Maybe my opinion will change once the arc is completed but it has been pretty average so far .",

I really think Boruto would be much cooler if there were a couple baddies running around with sharingan. Killing them all off was kind of lame. But I was saying I do like the idea that the Otsusuki can imbed themselves into humans and slowly take over. Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

Let's all be honest everyone in the Naruto era had a fucked up life. In Boruto everyone is peaceful after wars except some people. It's like predator vs prey . The prey being humans and the predators being the otsutsukis. At the end of Shippuden it was revealed that Naruto was the child of prophecy and the reincarnation of Ashura which means he had good destiny. When momoshiki saw Boruto fate in the manga even he felt pity. So yeah it's gonna be sad when this series turns dark and why the fuck Kawaki betrays Naruto. I will give the Boruto anime 6.5/10 or 7/10",

With Jigen and all the extra Ootsutsuki bullshit, shinobi and the villages in general are so completely irrelevant at this point that they might as well all be useless civilians.\n\nIt has become Dragonball in the sense that nothing matters besides what's directly happening to this very select group of characters and that's it. For a world like Naruto's that had so much interesting world building previously, it's a massive dip in quality and imo interesting story telling in general. There are countless other criticisms as well, like how every one and their fucking mother can absorb chakra making most jutsu useless now, or how all these new kids can skip handseals and learn techniques almost instantly, etc etc. The entire series is the most stereotypical example of a sequel being made for no reason other than milking a cash cow for merchandise. If people enjoy it that's fine, but I think calling it a \"great series\" especially when compared to the original, which had its own problems, is not a very accurate assessment at all.",

Sorry buddy, that's called character assassination for the sake of plot progression, something good authors do not do.\n\n> there isn\u2019t any real power creeps all the cyborgs have been shown to have a clear weakness and limitations\n\nDelta was shown fighting at S-rank taijutsu levels for a prolonged period of time, and she can also absorb and fire back jutsu. Whatever \"limitations\" they have don't mean shit, she is now automatically stronger than 99.9% of all Shinobi to have ever existed.\n\nThe sheer fact that you think there isn't power creep when the most recent villain just fought Naruto and Sasuke, 2 characters that already made most of the world irrelevant by the end of Shippuden, and wiped the floor with them is so laughable I'm inclined to believe you never even watched the original series to begin with. Jigen could waltz through the entire Shinobi world and instantly kill everyone. None of the villages matter, none of the Kage matter, none of their alliances or jutsus or bloodlines or *anything* matters. It's like dropping Superman into Game of Thrones. Congrats, he automatically beats everything and nothing matters, what an interesting story. Now we have to invent a bunch of new bullshit with Boruto and gang that's even stronger than things we've seen previously to deal with this new threat, that's called power creep.\n\nAnyone who has paid even an ounce of attention throughout the series can spot the glaring flaws and inconsistencies found within Boruto. Any good author could have worked around the issues in the series, like having the sequel take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or super old for example so you don't have to nerf them/make shit even stronger than them (again, avoiding power creep). Though seeing as you type like a 14 year old on a twitter rant (it's 'deaf' ears btw, not 'death' ears), I'm not surprised you enjoy the low effort garbage they keep putting out and seem to know very little about the original series in general. You're their target audience at this point I suppose, so good for them on the easy money.",

What where y\u2019all defenses for Naruto, he\u2019s the Hokage, he doesn\u2019t have a father to learn from, Naruto can\u2019t use clones in the Hokages office, naruto never learned how to be a good father etc where are all these excuses y\u2019all had for Naruto now it\u2019s just Narutos character was butchered Narutos character wasn\u2019t assassinated Naruto and Boruto\u2019s relationship was a parallel of Kishimoto and his sons relationship it was to show how Naruto and Kishimoto sometimes out their dream/job above their family sometimes and unintentionally hurt then yet they later on learn and grow from. I swear when the Naruto delta fight came out y\u2019all swore up and down Naruto was holding back some Imma throw that right back at you Naruto was holding back as well as fighting near the village and kids so he obviously couldn\u2019t use high lvl justus and again Delta had clear limitations if she absorbed to much chakra she would overload which she did and as I said she was fighting a held back and suppressed Naruto and I know there is a power creep but not any real ones the most recent villain is also an otsutsuki which have been shown to be the strongest beings in the whole Naruto verse yalls problem is y\u2019all want naruto and sasuke to always win and always be the strongest take your bias out of your judgment and you\u2019d actually enjoy Boruto until then you can continue to hate on it I\u2019ve watched the original and I also know there where already crazy powerful people in naruto before Boruto even came Along Kaguya, Madara, and the most wanked character of all Hagaromo it\u2019s not like dropping Superman in game of thrones because Naruto and Sasuke where still able to hold their own in the battle and they are still 2 of the strongest people in the shinobi world and nice insult my guy you can\u2019t bring up any good points so you opt to insults very classy and your complaining about 2 characters that have just barely been introduced to the story so this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s been going on for a long time only a month or 2 at most which leads me to believe y\u2019all find anything to complain about y\u2019all weren\u2019t complaining when Naruto and sasuke beat up Momoshiki",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

Her tale (including the alien part) derives from [The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter). And while it's true Kaguya could've gotten a more interesting character, it's probable Kishi didn't forget giving her character, since he makes Naruto explicitly mention how she didn't have a [proper personality.](https://gyazo.com/b587cff10035b604dc0084fb87ace23f)",

Delta is annoying , we know very little about Code as of now , Deepa was boring , Victor was boring and Boro seems okayish so far . The way Deepa was defeated was really underwhelming for me . I am really loving Kawaki's character so far though . I like him more than Boruto . Delta Vs Naruto was really underwhelming . I am ok with the fact that Naruto didnt use big jutsus out there but why didn't he used Shadow clones was beyond my understanding . Sasuke and Naruto Vs Jigen episode was the peak of this arc imo even though Sasuke and Naruto were clapped . This is all I have to say for now . Maybe my opinion will change once the arc is completed but it has been pretty average so far .",

I really think Boruto would be much cooler if there were a couple baddies running around with sharingan. Killing them all off was kind of lame. But I was saying I do like the idea that the Otsusuki can imbed themselves into humans and slowly take over. Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

I hope if there is a prequel series kishimoto needs to improve his ass . Iam not hating on kishimoto",

Let's all be honest everyone in the Naruto era had a fucked up life. In Boruto everyone is peaceful after wars except some people. It's like predator vs prey . The prey being humans and the predators being the otsutsukis. At the end of Shippuden it was revealed that Naruto was the child of prophecy and the reincarnation of Ashura which means he had good destiny. When momoshiki saw Boruto fate in the manga even he felt pity. So yeah it's gonna be sad when this series turns dark and why the fuck Kawaki betrays Naruto. I will give the Boruto anime 6.5/10 or 7/10",

Only 2 otsutsuki\u2019s have been shown and then otsutsuki where brought up in Naruto Boruto has no choice but to solve this and its been pretty much cleared up with some plot points here and there still needing to be filled there isn\u2019t any real power creeps all the cyborgs have been shown to have a clear weakness and limitations I agree that the side characters are rather irrelevant so I agree on that point barely anyone in Boruto can actually absorb chakra the only people shown so far is delta which had clear limitations Ao which had even clearer limitations Momoshiki, Isshiki, Boruto and Kawaki that\u2019s it and a good majority of these people have just barely been introduced so saying everyone can absorbed ninjutsu is honestly false none of the kids have skipped hand seals hand seals are still very relevant in Boruto Sarada just used hand seals when using chidori last episode and no one wants y\u2019all to call it a great anime we are just tired of y\u2019all talking shit if y\u2019all don\u2019t like it stfu and go rewatch naruto otherwise yalls complaints are falling on death ears and y\u2019all only do it to make y\u2019all selves feel better",

                    "body": "> Narutos character wasn\u2019t butchered\n\nHe broke a promise and went back on his ninja way to his own son in favor of doing mundane paper work when he can literally make perfect copies of himself that send back their memories. Sorry buddy, that's called character assassination for the sake of plot progression, something good authors do not do.\n\n> there isn\u2019t any real power creeps all the cyborgs have been shown to have a clear weakness and limitations\n\nDelta was shown fighting at S-rank taijutsu levels for a prolonged period of time, and she can also absorb and fire back jutsu. Whatever \"limitations\" they have don't mean shit, she is now automatically stronger than 99.9% of all Shinobi to have ever existed.\n\nThe sheer fact that you think there isn't power creep when the most recent villain just fought Naruto and Sasuke, 2 characters that already made most of the world irrelevant by the end of Shippuden, and wiped the floor with them is so laughable I'm inclined to believe you never even watched the original series to begin with. Jigen could waltz through the entire Shinobi world and instantly kill everyone. None of the villages matter, none of the Kage matter, none of their alliances or jutsus or bloodlines or *anything* matters. It's like dropping Superman into Game of Thrones. Congrats, he automatically beats everything and nothing matters, what an interesting story. Now we have to invent a bunch of new bullshit with Boruto and gang that's even stronger than things we've seen previously to deal with this new threat, that's called power creep.\n\nAnyone who has paid even an ounce of attention throughout the series can spot the glaring flaws and inconsistencies found within Boruto. Any good author could have worked around the issues in the series, like having the sequel take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or super old for example so you don't have to nerf them/make shit even stronger than them (again, avoiding power creep). Though seeing as you type like a 14 year old on a twitter rant (it's 'deaf' ears btw, not 'death' ears), I'm not surprised you enjoy the low effort garbage they keep putting out and seem to know very little about the original series in general. You're their target audience at this point I suppose, so good for them on the easy money.",

What where y\u2019all defenses for Naruto, he\u2019s the Hokage, he doesn\u2019t have a father to learn from, Naruto can\u2019t use clones in the Hokages office, naruto never learned how to be a good father etc where are all these excuses y\u2019all had for Naruto now it\u2019s just Narutos character was butchered Narutos character wasn\u2019t assassinated Naruto and Boruto\u2019s relationship was a parallel of Kishimoto and his sons relationship it was to show how Naruto and Kishimoto sometimes out their dream/job above their family sometimes and unintentionally hurt then yet they later on learn and grow from. I swear when the Naruto delta fight came out y\u2019all swore up and down Naruto was holding back some Imma throw that right back at you Naruto was holding back as well as fighting near the village and kids so he obviously couldn\u2019t use high lvl justus and again Delta had clear limitations if she absorbed to much chakra she would overload which she did and as I said she was fighting a held back and suppressed Naruto and I know there is a power creep but not any real ones the most recent villain is also an otsutsuki which have been shown to be the strongest beings in the whole Naruto verse yalls problem is y\u2019all want naruto and sasuke to always win and always be the strongest take your bias out of your judgment and you\u2019d actually enjoy Boruto until then you can continue to hate on it I\u2019ve watched the original and I also know there where already crazy powerful people in naruto before Boruto even came Along Kaguya, Madara, and the most wanked character of all Hagaromo it\u2019s not like dropping Superman in game of thrones because Naruto and Sasuke where still able to hold their own in the battle and they are still 2 of the strongest people in the shinobi world and nice insult my guy you can\u2019t bring up any good points so you opt to insults very classy and your complaining about 2 characters that have just barely been introduced to the story so this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s been going on for a long time only a month or 2 at most which leads me to believe y\u2019all find anything to complain about y\u2019all weren\u2019t complaining when Naruto and sasuke beat up Momoshiki",

I also never \"made excuses\" for Naruto and again, criticizing Naruto's actions within Boruto is a critique of the show, Boruto, since it does not align with how he is portrayed in the original series.\n\nFeel free to continue watching and enjoying Boruto by all means, as I said people who pay very little attention and don't care about lazy/inconsistent writing such as yourself are 100% their target audience at this point, so mostly kids.",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

Her tale (including the alien part) derives from [The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter). And while it's true Kaguya could've gotten a more interesting character, it's probable Kishi didn't forget giving her character, since he makes Naruto explicitly mention how she didn't have a [proper personality.](https://gyazo.com/b587cff10035b604dc0084fb87ace23f)",

I will provide a little more context as to why I am finding it average . First of all , unlike Akatsuki , where I liked almost every member of their organization I am not interested by any members of the Kara so far except Koji and Jigen/Isshiki . Delta is annoying , we know very little about Code as of now , Deepa was boring , Victor was boring and Boro seems okayish so far . The way Deepa was defeated was really underwhelming for me . I am really loving Kawaki's character so far though . I like him more than Boruto . Delta Vs Naruto was really underwhelming . I am ok with the fact that Naruto didnt use big jutsus out there but why didn't he used Shadow clones was beyond my understanding . Sasuke and Naruto Vs Jigen episode was the peak of this arc imo even though Sasuke and Naruto were clapped . This is all I have to say for now . Maybe my opinion will change once the arc is completed but it has been pretty average so far .",

I really think Boruto would be much cooler if there were a couple baddies running around with sharingan. Killing them all off was kind of lame. But I was saying I do like the idea that the Otsusuki can imbed themselves into humans and slowly take over. Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

The prey being humans and the predators being the otsutsukis. At the end of Shippuden it was revealed that Naruto was the child of prophecy and the reincarnation of Ashura which means he had good destiny. When momoshiki saw Boruto fate in the manga even he felt pity. So yeah it's gonna be sad when this series turns dark and why the fuck Kawaki betrays Naruto. I will give the Boruto anime 6.5/10 or 7/10",

            "body": "> Narutos character wasn\u2019t butchered\n\nHe broke a promise and went back on his ninja way to his own son in favor of doing mundane paper work when he can literally make perfect copies of himself that send back their memories. Sorry buddy, that's called character assassination for the sake of plot progression, something good authors do not do.\n\n> there isn\u2019t any real power creeps all the cyborgs have been shown to have a clear weakness and limitations\n\nDelta was shown fighting at S-rank taijutsu levels for a prolonged period of time, and she can also absorb and fire back jutsu. Whatever \"limitations\" they have don't mean shit, she is now automatically stronger than 99.9% of all Shinobi to have ever existed.\n\nThe sheer fact that you think there isn't power creep when the most recent villain just fought Naruto and Sasuke, 2 characters that already made most of the world irrelevant by the end of Shippuden, and wiped the floor with them is so laughable I'm inclined to believe you never even watched the original series to begin with. Jigen could waltz through the entire Shinobi world and instantly kill everyone. None of the villages matter, none of the Kage matter, none of their alliances or jutsus or bloodlines or *anything* matters. It's like dropping Superman into Game of Thrones. Congrats, he automatically beats everything and nothing matters, what an interesting story. Now we have to invent a bunch of new bullshit with Boruto and gang that's even stronger than things we've seen previously to deal with this new threat, that's called power creep.\n\nAnyone who has paid even an ounce of attention throughout the series can spot the glaring flaws and inconsistencies found within Boruto. Any good author could have worked around the issues in the series, like having the sequel take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or super old for example so you don't have to nerf them/make shit even stronger than them (again, avoiding power creep). Though seeing as you type like a 14 year old on a twitter rant (it's 'deaf' ears btw, not 'death' ears), I'm not surprised you enjoy the low effort garbage they keep putting out and seem to know very little about the original series in general. You're their target audience at this point I suppose, so good for them on the easy money.",

What where y\u2019all defenses for Naruto, he\u2019s the Hokage, he doesn\u2019t have a father to learn from, Naruto can\u2019t use clones in the Hokages office, naruto never learned how to be a good father etc where are all these excuses y\u2019all had for Naruto now it\u2019s just Narutos character was butchered Narutos character wasn\u2019t assassinated Naruto and Boruto\u2019s relationship was a parallel of Kishimoto and his sons relationship it was to show how Naruto and Kishimoto sometimes out their dream/job above their family sometimes and unintentionally hurt then yet they later on learn and grow from. I swear when the Naruto delta fight came out y\u2019all swore up and down Naruto was holding back some Imma throw that right back at you Naruto was holding back as well as fighting near the village and kids so he obviously couldn\u2019t use high lvl justus and again Delta had clear limitations if she absorbed to much chakra she would overload which she did and as I said she was fighting a held back and suppressed Naruto and I know there is a power creep but not any real ones the most recent villain is also an otsutsuki which have been shown to be the strongest beings in the whole Naruto verse yalls problem is y\u2019all want naruto and sasuke to always win and always be the strongest take your bias out of your judgment and you\u2019d actually enjoy Boruto until then you can continue to hate on it I\u2019ve watched the original and I also know there where already crazy powerful people in naruto before Boruto even came Along Kaguya, Madara, and the most wanked character of all Hagaromo it\u2019s not like dropping Superman in game of thrones because Naruto and Sasuke where still able to hold their own in the battle and they are still 2 of the strongest people in the shinobi world and nice insult my guy you can\u2019t bring up any good points so you opt to insults very classy and your complaining about 2 characters that have just barely been introduced to the story so this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s been going on for a long time only a month or 2 at most which leads me to believe y\u2019all find anything to complain about y\u2019all weren\u2019t complaining when Naruto and sasuke beat up Momoshiki",

I also never \"made excuses\" for Naruto and again, criticizing Naruto's actions within Boruto is a critique of the show, Boruto, since it does not align with how he is portrayed in the original series.\n\nFeel free to continue watching and enjoying Boruto by all means, as I said people who pay very little attention and don't care about lazy/inconsistent writing such as yourself are 100% their target audience at this point, so mostly kids.",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

Her tale (including the alien part) derives from [The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter).

The plot of Naruto just went all over the place with Madara/zestu/aliens but Boruto has their plot pretty reasonable but obviously they are just building off Naruto plot but I\u2019m thankful it isn\u2019t all fucked up like the end of Naruto",

I will provide a little more context as to why I am finding it average . First of all , unlike Akatsuki , where I liked almost every member of their organization I am not interested by any members of the Kara so far except Koji and Jigen/Isshiki . Delta is annoying , we know very little about Code as of now , Deepa was boring , Victor was boring and Boro seems okayish so far . The way Deepa was defeated was really underwhelming for me . I am really loving Kawaki's character so far though . I like him more than Boruto . Delta Vs Naruto was really underwhelming . I am ok with the fact that Naruto didnt use big jutsus out there but why didn't he used Shadow clones was beyond my understanding . Sasuke and Naruto Vs Jigen episode was the peak of this arc imo even though Sasuke and Naruto were clapped . This is all I have to say for now . Maybe my opinion will change once the arc is completed but it has been pretty average so far .",

I really think Boruto would be much cooler if there were a couple baddies running around with sharingan. Killing them all off was kind of lame. But I was saying I do like the idea that the Otsusuki can imbed themselves into humans and slowly take over. Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

Let's all be honest everyone in the Naruto era had a fucked up life. In Boruto everyone is peaceful after wars except some people. It's like predator vs prey . The prey being humans and the predators being the otsutsukis. At the end of Shippuden it was revealed that Naruto was the child of prophecy and the reincarnation of Ashura which means he had good destiny. When momoshiki saw Boruto fate in the manga even he felt pity. So yeah it's gonna be sad when this series turns dark and why the fuck Kawaki betrays Naruto. I will give the Boruto anime 6.5/10 or 7/10",

What where y\u2019all defenses for Naruto, he\u2019s the Hokage, he doesn\u2019t have a father to learn from, Naruto can\u2019t use clones in the Hokages office, naruto never learned how to be a good father etc where are all these excuses y\u2019all had for Naruto now it\u2019s just Narutos character was butchered Narutos character wasn\u2019t assassinated Naruto and Boruto\u2019s relationship was a parallel of Kishimoto and his sons relationship it was to show how Naruto and Kishimoto sometimes out their dream/job above their family sometimes and unintentionally hurt then yet they later on learn and grow from. I swear when the Naruto delta fight came out y\u2019all swore up and down Naruto was holding back some Imma throw that right back at you Naruto was holding back as well as fighting near the village and kids so he obviously couldn\u2019t use high lvl justus and again Delta had clear limitations if she absorbed to much chakra she would overload which she did and as I said she was fighting a held back and suppressed Naruto and I know there is a power creep but not any real ones the most recent villain is also an otsutsuki which have been shown to be the strongest beings in the whole Naruto verse yalls problem is y\u2019all want naruto and sasuke to always win and always be the strongest take your bias out of your judgment and you\u2019d actually enjoy Boruto until then you can continue to hate on it I\u2019ve watched the original and I also know there where already crazy powerful people in naruto before Boruto even came Along Kaguya, Madara, and the most wanked character of all Hagaromo it\u2019s not like dropping Superman in game of thrones because Naruto and Sasuke where still able to hold their own in the battle and they are still 2 of the strongest people in the shinobi world and nice insult my guy you can\u2019t bring up any good points so you opt to insults very classy and your complaining about 2 characters that have just barely been introduced to the story so this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s been going on for a long time only a month or 2 at most which leads me to believe y\u2019all find anything to complain about y\u2019all weren\u2019t complaining when Naruto and sasuke beat up Momoshiki",

I also never \"made excuses\" for Naruto and again, criticizing Naruto's actions within Boruto is a critique of the show, Boruto, since it does not align with how he is portrayed in the original series.\n\nFeel free to continue watching and enjoying Boruto by all means, as I said people who pay very little attention and don't care about lazy/inconsistent writing such as yourself are 100% their target audience at this point, so mostly kids.",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

I am ok with the fact that Naruto didnt use big jutsus out there but why didn't he used Shadow clones was beyond my understanding . Sasuke and Naruto Vs Jigen episode was the peak of this arc imo even though Sasuke and Naruto were clapped . This is all I have to say for now .

I really think Boruto would be much cooler if there were a couple baddies running around with sharingan. Killing them all off was kind of lame. But I was saying I do like the idea that the Otsusuki can imbed themselves into humans and slowly take over. Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

I also never \"made excuses\" for Naruto and again, criticizing Naruto's actions within Boruto is a critique of the show, Boruto, since it does not align with how he is portrayed in the original series.\n\nFeel free to continue watching and enjoying Boruto by all means, as I said people who pay very little attention and don't care about lazy/inconsistent writing such as yourself are 100% their target audience at this point, so mostly kids.",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

I think the Five Kage Summit Arc is really interesting not only because of the action (which was plentiful and great), or Tobi's lore drops about Ten tails and Tsuki no me (which were great), but Naruto's and Sasuke's character development during this one arc! \n\nThen to fix the war arc there are 2 key things: portray Kabuto and Obito as more likable (people hated obito for \"starting the war because of his girl\"), and ending the fight against Juubito more boldly, rather than \"power of friendship\".",

Naruto Part 1 illustrates that Ninjas are military power for the countries. There's a reason why Suna-Gakure attacked Konoha-Gakure despite having a peace contract. The chunin exams had political meaning etc. \nThis was kind of thrown away in later Part 1 (we barely see any political ramifications of the failed attack for Suna-Gakure even though they already had a shortage of shinobi) and Part 2 or extremely simplified. Especially in the war arc, where all sides just suddenly trusted each other after the Gaara speech despite having decades of grudges against each other. The five kage summit arc was disappointing as well in that regard for me. Just because we get the names and appearances of all the five Kage, doesn't mean that this arc makes the world more complex or deep. \n\nIn general, I think that Naruto Part 1 had major elements that did shape the world and created an understanding how this world functions. Doesn't change that for me just because we didn't know who exactly the Kage were.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

Then the idea that maybe a human could control the power of an Otsusuki would be dope AF but obviously we don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible or if things will go that route. I also agree that the ninja tool body gimmick is kind of overboard and absorbing jutsu is kind of annoying",

The naruto in Boruto is way older and way more realistic with his situation then he was as a kid he\u2019s an adult so of course his actions are gonna differ then when he was 16 years old dude is 33 years old now if there is any adult that acts the same as they did when they where 16 there is an actual problem and I\u2019m not spacing cuz this isn\u2019t a graded essay I\u2019m not worried about correct punctuation and all that lol wether I spaced it out or not the word count will be the same and my intentions will still be the same and you seem to be the person who pays no attention to what\u2019s going on in Boruto I will agree that they are inconsistent with characters at moments mainly boruto but plot wise it\u2019s consistent there are arcs here and there that drag but overall Boruto isn\u2019t bad and there is a coherent story being told and I love how you act as if your some master critique of writing and storytelling yet most of your points you brought up barely appear in Boruto at all I\u2019m not creating a group of people that hate Boruto you can very clearly see that there is a group of people that hate on Boruto blindly shii this Subreddit is a perfect example I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a post hating on Boruto every other day no one cares if you critique the show and point out flaws but blindly hating on it and making up things just to hate on Boruto is annoying and you have no stats backing up your claim that Boruto only targets kids there are multiple adult you tubers that react to boruto every week and as I said if Boruto was as bad as y\u2019all make it seem it wouldn\u2019t be one of the most streamed new Gen anime\u2019s Its only really hated on in the west and you can\u2019t do anything else so you resort to disrespect lol I guess I have to be a kid to like a show do you have any stats to back up that claim or is that just your opinion?",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",

That's the main reason why I disagree with your sentiment.\nWe already have tons of information beforehand. \n\nMinato/Kushina backstory didn't give us that many (new) information about the world. That was more important for Naruto's character arc later on.\n\nThe history of the ninja world is probably one of the \nweaker aspects in part 2 depending on the era in my opinion, considering that Black Zetsu manipulated major events which is written in a very contrived matter. The Kaguya stuff never was intriguing to me and when the sixth paths lost his mystery and suspense, I quickly lost interest in that timeline. \nThere's also chunks of history already in Part 1 and in Part 2 before the pain arc, so that's nothing exclusive for the story section after the Pain Arc. \n\n\nFormation of the leaf has some compelling aspects (neglect of the Uchiha), but also some pretty poor ones for me. I might be missing something, but what happened to the Senju Clan? They always felt underrepresentative in Konoha despite being as prestigious as the Uchiha clan. \n\nWe don't know much about the warring states era, the focus was more on Madara/Hashirama and how they were affected by this era. But several different small states joining together to a country is definitely a piece of lore that adds context for the world.",
