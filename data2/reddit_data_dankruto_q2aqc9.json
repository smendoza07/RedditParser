Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it.

His name got attacked as a supervisor but it was his long-time assistants, Kodachi (storyboard) and Ikemoto (art) that were in charge. Kishimoto then took some time off and started a new manga that got canceled after a year in March 2020. Then for some reason, Kishimoto decided to take over storyboarding Boruto last November during the end of the Kawaki arc. \n\nJust a really bizarre set of events and I don't think it's ever been explained why he suddenly replaced Kodachi out of the blue.",

He could keep up with fused Momoshiki and Kaguya but Isshiki all of a sudden is too fast despite not being much stronger than Kaguya.\n\nAlso even if it was too fast to dodge he could at least Almighty Push them away or use Amenotejikara to switch out. Heck he could even try to Amaterasu them.\n\nIt just feels like a contrivance.",

On top of that, nobody before Naruto was able to successfully add a change in chakara nature to the Rasengan, which means Naruto had to work from scratch to do just that. He had to figure it out on his own. Boruto did it by accident, learned what was happening, and figured out how he did it.

And the thing is he already knew how to absorb chakra with the rinnegan, he used it on Naruto for the last chidori in the final battle. He even learned a few other abilities in just a day, including Planetary Devastation and Universal Pull.\n\nHonestly, the writers did him very dirty in Boruto.",

Kishimoto then took some time off and started a new manga that got canceled after a year in March 2020. Then for some reason, Kishimoto decided to take over storyboarding Boruto last November during the end of the Kawaki arc. \n\nJust a really bizarre set of events and I don't think it's ever been explained why he suddenly replaced Kodachi out of the blue.",

On top of that, nobody before Naruto was able to successfully add a change in chakara nature to the Rasengan, which means Naruto had to work from scratch to do just that.

For some people, some things like changes in chakara nature come naturally, this was already explained before Boruto\n\nThis right here is the problem.\n\nTwo of the most prodigious shinobi in the Leaf's history couldn't add a change in chakra nature to the rasengan but Boruto could because it came to him \"naturally\".\n\nI mean sure they \"explained\" it, but such bullshit explanations don't make for a fun show. If you wanna watch a shounen where the MC is a plot device that's fine, but we'll keep calling such shows bad.",

Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it.

Kishimoto came at the end of the Kawaki Arc and while he's the storyboard writer from Baryon Mode onwards I can't help but think this was Kodachi's script because none of this feels like Kishimoto's idea. Kishimoto gives ass-pull powerups but I've never seen him just nerf characters for the sake of powerscaling. I've seen Kodachi do that though.\n\nSo if I had to guess Kishimoto was told that Sasuke would have to lose his Rinnegan and Naruto would have to lose the Nine-Tails.",

And when he was 16 it took a year's worth of time (cut down immensely with shadow clones) to add nature transformation to it which was something both Minato and Kakashi failed at.

On top of that, nobody before Naruto was able to successfully add a change in chakara nature to the Rasengan, which means Naruto had to work from scratch to do just that. He had to figure it out on his own. Boruto did it by accident, learned what was happening, and figured out how he did it. For some people, some things like changes in chakara nature come naturally, this was already explained before Boruto.\n\nBut hey, half the Naruto fanbase is a circle jerk of \"Naruto good, Boruto bad\" and ignores half the shit that even happens in either series.",

Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it.

Kishimoto came at the end of the Kawaki Arc and while he's the storyboard writer from Baryon Mode onwards I can't help but think this was Kodachi's script because none of this feels like Kishimoto's idea. Kishimoto gives ass-pull powerups but I've never seen him just nerf characters for the sake of powerscaling. I've seen Kodachi do that though.\n\nSo if I had to guess Kishimoto was told that Sasuke would have to lose his Rinnegan and Naruto would have to lose the Nine-Tails.",

Kishimoto then took some time off and started a new manga that got canceled after a year in March 2020. Then for some reason, Kishimoto decided to take over storyboarding Boruto last November during the end of the Kawaki arc. \n\nJust a really bizarre set of events and I don't think it's ever been explained why he suddenly replaced Kodachi out of the blue.",

On top of that, nobody before Naruto was able to successfully add a change in chakara nature to the Rasengan, which means Naruto had to work from scratch to do just that. He had to figure it out on his own. Boruto did it by accident, learned what was happening, and figured out how he did it.

The fans liked it anyway. There were badly explained stuff or random shit that happened in Naruto, but at least it wasn't too unbelievable. People like what they like and what's good, and Boruto just ain't it.",

Kishimoto gives ass-pull powerups but I've never seen him just nerf characters for the sake of powerscaling. I've seen Kodachi do that though.\n\nSo if I had to guess Kishimoto was told that Sasuke would have to lose his Rinnegan and Naruto would have to lose the Nine-Tails.",

On top of that, nobody before Naruto was able to successfully add a change in chakara nature to the Rasengan, which means Naruto had to work from scratch to do just that. He had to figure it out on his own. Boruto did it by accident, learned what was happening, and figured out how he did it. For some people, some things like changes in chakara nature come naturally, this was already explained before Boruto.\n\nBut hey, half the Naruto fanbase is a circle jerk of \"Naruto good, Boruto bad\" and ignores half the shit that even happens in either series.",

Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it.

Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it. I'm saying that if you DON'T KNOW how to factor, you can't do integral calculus.",

Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it. I'm saying that if you DON'T KNOW how to factor, you can't do integral calculus.",

Kishimoto gives ass-pull powerups but I've never seen him just nerf characters for the sake of powerscaling.

Hell most people who have taken calculus can factor in their head to an extent. My point is that without knowing how to factor a polynomial, you can't do integral calculus. \n\n>Or are you just attempting a failed insult because I pointed out how it is realistic to be able to do that?\n\nI'm not saying you can't factor in your head or take integrals in your head, I can do it.
