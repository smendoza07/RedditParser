As an aside, a longtime friend of mine (high single digits multimillionaire at minimum) told me that the root cause of his second divorce was her raging jealousy regarding the level of attention, and especially any gifts, he gave his 3 children (one girl, two boys) from his first marriage. As if the kids, all early-teens to late-teens, at the time, were her rivals. The picture he painted: any gift to one of his kids had to be quickly matched, for her to then receive a gift at a much higher dollar level. She had one child from an earlier marriage, a son in his mid 20s or so, at the time, who was living independently on his own. They continued to clash over that topic and later divorced.",

She always said she didn't have time for, or want a conventional relationship, which I respect, but it's just gone so well between us, and everything feels so natural and nice. \n\nLike I said, it's all me being weird. Was riding a high after a great weekend together, and crashing now. It'll be fine.",

I am curious, did you ask her if she has anxiety or mood swings? :) and what makes her feel most comfortable when she finds herself in these situations?\n\nI would suggest to reach out to her, but not before a couple of days, because she might feel overwhelmed with all the other stuff going on in her life combined. Best way would be, to explain how you are feeling and what you wish for, just as you did in this post ;) maybe something along this: \"I really enjoyed our weekend and I realized I am feeling a bit down because I feel like I am crashing now after riding a high. I wish we can repeat that again sometime soon. I want you to know that I care about you. Let me know if I can do anything to make your busy schedule less stressful.\"\n\nMaybe you can buy her groceries (buy online and let it delivered to her) to make her busy schedule less stressful? Or maybe she would prefer flowers over groceries? A little gesture like this will help :)\n\nI wish you good luck \ud83e\udd0d",

As an aside, a longtime friend of mine (high single digits multimillionaire at minimum) told me that the root cause of his second divorce was her raging jealousy regarding the level of attention, and especially any gifts, he gave his 3 children (one girl, two boys) from his first marriage. As if the kids, all early-teens to late-teens, at the time, were her rivals. The picture he painted: any gift to one of his kids had to be quickly matched, for her to then receive a gift at a much higher dollar level. She had one child from an earlier marriage, a son in his mid 20s or so, at the time, who was living independently on his own. They continued to clash over that topic and later divorced.",

Best way would be, to explain how you are feeling and what you wish for, just as you did in this post ;) maybe something along this: \"I really enjoyed our weekend and I realized I am feeling a bit down because I feel like I am crashing now after riding a high. I wish we can repeat that again sometime soon. I want you to know that I care about you. Let me know if I can do anything to make your busy schedule less stressful.\"\n\nMaybe you can buy her groceries (buy online and let it delivered to her) to make her busy schedule less stressful?

As an aside, a longtime friend of mine (high single digits multimillionaire at minimum) told me that the root cause of his second divorce was her raging jealousy regarding the level of attention, and especially any gifts, he gave his 3 children (one girl, two boys) from his first marriage. As if the kids, all early-teens to late-teens, at the time, were her rivals. The picture he painted: any gift to one of his kids had to be quickly matched, for her to then receive a gift at a much higher dollar level. She had one child from an earlier marriage, a son in his mid 20s or so, at the time, who was living independently on his own. They continued to clash over that topic and later divorced.",
