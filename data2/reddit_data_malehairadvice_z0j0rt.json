Most of these things are in your control and you need to give yourself something to work with. Any long hair haircut will look like shit if you start to lose hair. in 2 years you will either be a balding,more overweight dude that looks worse than now, or a buff stud with a killer beard and a buzzcut.\n\nSorry for the tough love, but you have the option of looking super good , so dont go around looking like the lovechild of Cartman and Kyle from southpark.",
