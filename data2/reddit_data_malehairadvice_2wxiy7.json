I blow dry my hair and give it some volume with a rolled brush and pulling it up and back while it's drying. When I go to add product I bend forward a bit and run my hands (with product on them) over the hair from front to back. When there is an even coating of product on them I stand straight again and run my finger tips through the hair as if it were a comb or brush to get it into the right shape. Then I use the left over product from my palms to shape the sides of the hair above the ears. After a bit of playing with it to get it all lined up how I want (USE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS AND VERY LITTLE EXTRA PRODUCT) I spray some got2b glued hairspray over my hair and use that first 15 seconds before it hardens to ensure the shape is perfect so it settles how I want. By the end of the day my hair still looks great and very \"raw\", like there is very little product and the style looks natural. ",
