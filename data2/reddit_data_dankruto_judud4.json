Rock Lee had no acumen for ninjutsu or genjutsu, so he trained harder than anyone could possibly fathom to become a master of taijutsu to compensate; learning how to open the 8 Gates was sort of a requirement for him. In a world where most shinobi at least have decent proficiency with ninjutsu and/or genjutsu, I guess they just didn\u2019t deem it to really be worth the effort/risk to teach something as dangerous as opening the 8 Gates",

Opening the 8 Inner Gates is incredibly difficult and extremely dangerous; even someone as skilled as Kakashi could only open the 1st gate I believe (pls correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Rock Lee had no acumen for ninjutsu or genjutsu, so he trained harder than anyone could possibly fathom to become a master of taijutsu to compensate; learning how to open the 8 Gates was sort of a requirement for him. In a world where most shinobi at least have decent proficiency with ninjutsu and/or genjutsu, I guess they just didn\u2019t deem it to really be worth the effort/risk to teach something as dangerous as opening the 8 Gates",

If unlocking the 8 Gates was taught on a larger scale, more people would be inclined to use it, and pushing yourself too far with it could very easily result in putting yourself out of commission for a long while, if not permanently (even if you don\u2019t die). Remember that it was Gaara\u2019s sand coffin + Lee using the 4th gate together that would\u2019ve ended his life as a shinobi if not for Tsunade showing up at the perfect time. \n\nHaving a large quantity of ninja on the injured list at any given time just isn\u2019t practical for a village, otherwise you get more situations where you\u2019re forced to send genin on an S-rank mission to retrieve a comrade from one of the legendary sannin lol",

Rock Lee had no acumen for ninjutsu or genjutsu, so he trained harder than anyone could possibly fathom to become a master of taijutsu to compensate; learning how to open the 8 Gates was sort of a requirement for him. In a world where most shinobi at least have decent proficiency with ninjutsu and/or genjutsu, I guess they just didn\u2019t deem it to really be worth the effort/risk to teach something as dangerous as opening the 8 Gates",

Rock Lee had no acumen for ninjutsu or genjutsu, so he trained harder than anyone could possibly fathom to become a master of taijutsu to compensate; learning how to open the 8 Gates was sort of a requirement for him. In a world where most shinobi at least have decent proficiency with ninjutsu and/or genjutsu, I guess they just didn\u2019t deem it to really be worth the effort/risk to teach something as dangerous as opening the 8 Gates",
