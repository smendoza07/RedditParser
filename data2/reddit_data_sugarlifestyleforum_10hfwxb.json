    "body": "I've been following this sub for about two years. 3 days ago I made an account on Seeking. Almost every man I see with the Online filter has messaged me. I live near an affluent area. Lots of 6 figure salaries and some millionaires sprinkled here and there. I don't want to give any personal information but if I told you where I live you would immediately understand what I mean.\n\nEDIT: Since everyone keeps mentioning it. When I say 6 figures and some millionaires I'm NOT talking about the amounts I see on Seeking. I'm talking about what I know to be true from years of living and working here. \n\nNow, I clearly misunderstood something about the sugar lifestyle because it did not go at all the way I thought it would. The men there are just Shocked, SHOCKED I say, to learn that I expect gifts or an allowance. I wanted to see what would happen so some of them I asked for gifts, and then the others I suggested an allowance.\n\nI didn't say anything about cash app and I didn't tell them my cat died and I needed funeral money. It's not the first thing we talk about either. We first talk for a bit and then THEY hit me with the: \"What type of arrangement are you looking for?\". So I tell them. And for the record I never mentioned a specific dollar amount, just that I expected an allowance. And for the second group of men I told them what kind of gifts I would like.\n\nWhat follows is usually they tell me they're no longer interested or they block. And from lurking in this subreddit I can guess why. \"I don't want it to feel transactional.\" \"I'm not an ATM machine.\" \"The date itself is the gift.\"\n\nBut then WHAT'S THE POINT?\n\nI can have any attractive and smart young man pay for dinner and occasionally gift me things. Why would I go out and have sex with a 50 year old when all he wants to give me is \"dinner\" or \"an experience\".\n\nI doN't WAnt it To FeEL trAnSAcTionAl. BUT IT IS. The only reason any attractive young woman becomes or tries to become a sugar baby is because of the IMPLICATION.\n\nIn the end, I didn't really lose anything by joining Seeking for 3 days. There's two men I've been talking to who seem promising, but I haven't met them yet. So who knows how that's gonna turn out.\n\nGo ahead and downvote. But you know that's the truth. What's the \"Sugar\" supposed to mean exactly?",

            "body": "Most of the people are full of crap and trying to get pics, sexting or even sex for free.  In other words, you're dealing with scammers.  Not everyone there is a scammer by the way, there are real guys who are happy to share their wealth with the right SB.  I know because I'm one of them.  The real guys know there's going to be money involved and most probably already have a figure or arrangement they're comfortable with.  Any guy who hesitates, makes excuses, gets uncomfortable or claims he doesn't want to give you money because he doesn't want it to feel transactional is full of shit.   These are guys who have no intention of giving you anything and are only looking to get from you.  The real guys have no problem discussing the arrangement (as uncomfortable of an elephant as it can be sometimes) and have even less of an issue with actually forking over the dough.  \n\nWhatever SA or a guy tells you about his net worth or income is bullshit.  I was forced by SA to put something in but I don't like showing off my money or revealing too much about it.  There's plenty and that's all that needs to be said on that matter.  I'd go further to say most guys who want to show off their wealth have less than the guys who keep it simple.   So don't make the mistake of using advertised net worth or income as a gauge of anything because it doesn't matter.  Ultimately its what a guy is willing to share and can afford to do so that matters because that's the part that will affect you.\n\nAs Marilyn Monroe said: \"Don't you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You wouldn't marry a girl just because she's pretty, but my goodness, doesn't it help?\"\n\nSo...you have to  dig through a big steaming pile of shit to find the diamonds that are stuffed into the pile.  Its not pleasant or comfortable, but if you follow some rules and guidelines and get better at spotting the fakes so you don't waste as much time on them, the diamonds will begin to reveal themselves more easily to your eyes.   Best of luck!!",

Shit may be a hard term, but basically you are going to mine through a lot of crap before hitting paydirt.\n\nWhen I met my SB I took an immediate chance and set an allowance based arrangement up before we'd actually met but after we'd spent a lot of time texting, phoning, video-calling. We agreed the allowance - to the low end of what she was looking for (I've since doubled the allowance in our year together) and will occasionally help her out with gifts, holidays, etc.\n\nI am NOT a millionaire - far from it.  However, I have disposable income - and that's what I use for sugaring. I'm also lucky enough to have a flexible skillset and am self-employed so typically if I need some more money, I get off my arse and make some more money. :-)\n\nDon't get hung up on net worth, etc. (Mine is nowhere near what it should be but I have enough assets for my current lifestyle and my future) but look at the liquidity of what your potential SD has (i.e. how much cash can he get his hands on if needed to meet an emergency), and his disposable income - not the value of house, car, etc.\n\nGood luck!",

Money conversations run counter to that mission, right?  So the narrative an SB uses and her true feelings is crucial to activating the SD\u2019s generosity and loyalty while also avoiding any upsets when it comes to money issues.",

The only reason any attractive young woman becomes or tries to become a sugar baby is because of the IMPLICATION.\n\nI've had the full range of SRs. I've had 100% entirely transactional it was almost a \"bulk buy\" deal from an escort. That feels like what you sort of want.\n\nI've had the other range which are like normal relationships with \"I love you\" and \"can we move in together?\" and it being a 100% real, legit relationship.\n\nI've also had relationships closer to those extremes. My current SR is 75% towards the \"I love you\" and 25% towards the bulk buy escort deal.\n\nNone of this is right or wrong, different folks what different things. Whilst they all require cash to go from me to my partner the context it is given is wildly different:\n\n1. This is what I want, this is when I want it. Give it to me.\n2. I want things, but I don't want to tell you, just read me, learn me and delight me. The more you delight me, the more I'll delight you\n3. I want you, love you first and foremost. I don't want you to pay my tuition bill because it's on me but I am really, really stuck paying it so begrudgingly accept it as I have no other choice but I'm scared you think I'm taking advantage of you.\n\nI think the acid test is how well they'd deal with me going short. (3) wouldn't care and would be desperate to see me and would be happy to travel bus / ship or whatever. (2) would care but has suggsted non sugar relationship & continue seeing each other but prefers the cash as it just makes life easier. (1) I wouldn't see for dust.\n\nYou feel closer to (1) and that's fine but not everyone is. Also, I'm pretty wealthy and so can be (1) but it's not for me. I prefer (2) and a bit of (3) but obviously old, broke guys can only be (4) \"I'll buy dinner and an uber, can you host?\" and they way outnumber the (1)s, (2)s & (3)s SDs.",

If you\u2019ve been reading this sub for 2 years you\u2019d know that it takes a long time to find a good SR and that in your first few days you\u2019re going to be bombarded with scammers. \n\n2) You are placing stock in the self-reported income numbers.  Bonus: you don\u2019t know what \u201cmillionaire\u201d means. \n\n3) You\u2019re believing that men are \u201cshocked\u201d that you\u2019re looking for an SR on Seeking. No one is shocked.  They\u2019re scammers trying to pull one over on unsuspecting newbies. \n\n4) You\u2019re combining \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be transactional\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like an ATM\u201d with \u201cthe date is the gift.\u201d   A good SR is not transactional and no one wants to be treated like an ATM, and you\u2019ll hear SDs who dislike both of those situations, but \u201cthe date is the gift\u201d is not a common sentiment here and is only true in very rare circumstances (some SBs are in it for experiences, but those experiences should be very high end and this is not something most SBs want).  \n\n5) After this whole ridiculous rant you mention that you have 2 POTs you\u2019re still interested in.  So 3 days on the site, 2 POTs and you\u2019re complaining because of men on the site who aren\u2019t offering what you want?

An allowance is expected, and it's reasonable to discuss it fairly early (so that people don't waste their time), but don't do it on SA (move off the site first), and you might sound like someone who's going to take the money and run.  There's a lot of nuance in exactly what you say. \n\nAnother possibility is that your profile is somehow attracting the wrong guys (and not attracting the right guys).
