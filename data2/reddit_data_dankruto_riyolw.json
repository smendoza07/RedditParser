You don't because the textile covering your eyelids doesn't let light *through* its fibers, which would be essential for you to perceive visually your environment. This is because the only way we see things is through the light that bounces, like my huge cheeks, on them. Thus, you cannot be able to *see* through your blindfold which is a textile and the latter being composed of fibers who cannot let light through.\n\nAlthough I would not expect a *liberal* from understanding physics, because liberals hate order. Let's say hypothetically, they did. They would then not be liberal because that'd mean they'd obey, which completely goes against their very own nature of *liberals*.",

If that was the case then how come Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi or any other of Itachi's abilities aside from Amaterasu. And in the case of Amaterasu, if it isn't Sasuke own ability then why does he have Kagutsuchi, an ability that is completely *useless* without Amaterasu? He obviously didn't get it from Itachi so what, is Kishimoto that bad of a writer? I don't think so. \n\n>It's not just a physical thing otherwise Kakashi wouldn't be able to use ANY sharigan techniques.\n\nDon't confuse an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and a Transplanted Sharingan. The EMS is a process that upgrades one's sharingan by using the chakra of another compatible sharingan while the transplant is well...just a transplant. It's like with Madara's Rinnegan, by consuming Hashirama chakra, he awakened it on his own. He didn't get any of Hashirama's own abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only Itachi's eyeballs in Sasuke. Everything else is all Sasuke.",

And he obviously copied many techniques earning *that* nickname meaning many Uchihas couldn't easily do the same despite also neing sharingan users.\n\n\nIf you hadn't said user I'd have said Obito or Sasuke",

You don't because the textile covering your eyelids doesn't let light *through* its fibers, which would be essential for you to perceive visually your environment.

Thus, you cannot be able to *see* through your blindfold which is a textile and the latter being composed of fibers who cannot let light through.\n\nAlthough I would not expect a *liberal* from understanding physics, because liberals hate order. Let's say hypothetically, they did. They would then not be liberal because that'd mean they'd obey, which completely goes against their very own nature of *liberals*.",

If that was the case then how come Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi or any other of Itachi's abilities aside from Amaterasu. And in the case of Amaterasu, if it isn't Sasuke own ability then why does he have Kagutsuchi, an ability that is completely *useless* without Amaterasu? He obviously didn't get it from Itachi so what, is Kishimoto that bad of a writer? I don't think so. \n\n>It's not just a physical thing otherwise Kakashi wouldn't be able to use ANY sharigan techniques.\n\nDon't confuse an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and a Transplanted Sharingan. The EMS is a process that upgrades one's sharingan by using the chakra of another compatible sharingan while the transplant is well...just a transplant. It's like with Madara's Rinnegan, by consuming Hashirama chakra, he awakened it on his own. He didn't get any of Hashirama's own abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only Itachi's eyeballs in Sasuke. Everything else is all Sasuke.",

You don't because the textile covering your eyelids doesn't let light *through* its fibers, which would be essential for you to perceive visually your environment. This is because the only way we see things is through the light that bounces, like my huge cheeks, on them. Thus, you cannot be able to *see* through your blindfold which is a textile and the latter being composed of fibers who cannot let light through.\n\nAlthough I would not expect a *liberal* from understanding physics, because liberals hate order. Let's say hypothetically, they did. They would then not be liberal because that'd mean they'd obey, which completely goes against their very own nature of *liberals*.",

If that was the case then how come Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi or any other of Itachi's abilities aside from Amaterasu. And in the case of Amaterasu, if it isn't Sasuke own ability then why does he have Kagutsuchi, an ability that is completely *useless* without Amaterasu? He obviously didn't get it from Itachi so what, is Kishimoto that bad of a writer? I don't think so. \n\n>It's not just a physical thing otherwise Kakashi wouldn't be able to use ANY sharigan techniques.\n\nDon't confuse an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and a Transplanted Sharingan. The EMS is a process that upgrades one's sharingan by using the chakra of another compatible sharingan while the transplant is well...just a transplant. It's like with Madara's Rinnegan, by consuming Hashirama chakra, he awakened it on his own. He didn't get any of Hashirama's own abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only Itachi's eyeballs in Sasuke. Everything else is all Sasuke.",

If that was the case then how come Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi or any other of Itachi's abilities aside from Amaterasu. And in the case of Amaterasu, if it isn't Sasuke own ability then why does he have Kagutsuchi, an ability that is completely *useless* without Amaterasu? He obviously didn't get it from Itachi so what, is Kishimoto that bad of a writer? I don't think so. \n\n>It's not just a physical thing otherwise Kakashi wouldn't be able to use ANY sharigan techniques.\n\nDon't confuse an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and a Transplanted Sharingan. The EMS is a process that upgrades one's sharingan by using the chakra of another compatible sharingan while the transplant is well...just a transplant. It's like with Madara's Rinnegan, by consuming Hashirama chakra, he awakened it on his own. He didn't get any of Hashirama's own abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only Itachi's eyeballs in Sasuke. Everything else is all Sasuke.",

If that was the case then how come Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi or any other of Itachi's abilities aside from Amaterasu. And in the case of Amaterasu, if it isn't Sasuke own ability then why does he have Kagutsuchi, an ability that is completely *useless* without Amaterasu? He obviously didn't get it from Itachi so what, is Kishimoto that bad of a writer? I don't think so. \n\n>It's not just a physical thing otherwise Kakashi wouldn't be able to use ANY sharigan techniques.\n\nDon't confuse an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and a Transplanted Sharingan. The EMS is a process that upgrades one's sharingan by using the chakra of another compatible sharingan while the transplant is well...just a transplant. It's like with Madara's Rinnegan, by consuming Hashirama chakra, he awakened it on his own. He didn't get any of Hashirama's own abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only Itachi's eyeballs in Sasuke. Everything else is all Sasuke.",

If that was the case then how come Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi or any other of Itachi's abilities aside from Amaterasu. And in the case of Amaterasu, if it isn't Sasuke own ability then why does he have Kagutsuchi, an ability that is completely *useless* without Amaterasu? He obviously didn't get it from Itachi so what, is Kishimoto that bad of a writer? I don't think so. \n\n>It's not just a physical thing otherwise Kakashi wouldn't be able to use ANY sharigan techniques.\n\nDon't confuse an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and a Transplanted Sharingan. The EMS is a process that upgrades one's sharingan by using the chakra of another compatible sharingan while the transplant is well...just a transplant. It's like with Madara's Rinnegan, by consuming Hashirama chakra, he awakened it on his own. He didn't get any of Hashirama's own abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only Itachi's eyeballs in Sasuke. Everything else is all Sasuke.",
