Your hair looks a bit frizzy and dry, so I'd encourage you to look into resources to resolve those. Both are pretty simple, but the long and short of it is: use less shampoo, more conditioner, air-dry or pat-dry your hair, and get a leave-in conditioner. You may have to play around with that to figure out what works for your hair/skin, but thats a broad outline.",

Talk to them about what you want and how do you want to look and get the haircut. I'd suggest you to oil and wash your hair after every 2 days. Oil it with coconut oil and wash it with some herbal or natural shampoo. Look for a brand named Patanjali if they sell in whatever country you are from, if not then use normal shampoo and keep it growing. Eat healthy and exercise as well because although we don't want to say it but it helps.",

Oil it with coconut oil and wash it with some herbal or natural shampoo. Look for a brand named Patanjali if they sell in whatever country you are from, if not then use normal shampoo and keep it growing.

Get fucked man. Your making a judgement on the 99% because of some 1% shitheads?\n\nYou\u2019re not helping and the actor doesn\u2019t need you to \u201cdefend\u201d him. Go away.",

Talk to them about what you want and how do you want to look and get the haircut. I'd suggest you to oil and wash your hair after every 2 days. Oil it with coconut oil and wash it with some herbal or natural shampoo. Look for a brand named Patanjali if they sell in whatever country you are from, if not then use normal shampoo and keep it growing. Eat healthy and exercise as well because although we don't want to say it but it helps.",
