Both these hairstyles highlight those features which are generally not seen as attractive nor aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore your hair is of low quality (e.g dry and frizzy) which doesn't work well with longer hairstyles.\n\nI'd personally say that you have two options; Buzz/go bald or choose a shorter hairstyle with your hair pulled forward. If your high temples are becuase of balding (e.g your hairline has gradually creeped further and further back) I'd suggest going bald because it's only going to get worse. If you've more or less always had that hairline you're not necessarily balding. Then a shorter hairstyle could work as it will draw attention away from your high temples. Also if you decide to keep your hair you should look in to proper haircare for dry and frizzy hair. Generally buy shampoos and conditioners with oil. It doesn't have to be expensive, just not the cheapest most intense hair products designed for greasy hair. Also, don't wash your hair every day. 2-3 times a week is enough.",

                            "body": "From what I can gather:.\n\n'washing' your hair (i.e. with shampoo) strips your hair of oils that act as natural protective barriers\n\nand 'conditioning' your hair (with conditioner) helps supplement your hair with these oils.\n\nTherefore shampooing every day is bad for your hair, and will leave it dry and frizzy. You also do not *need* to wash your hair every day. \n\nTo my knowledge, an ideal hair routine would be to wash your hair with shampoo 2-3 times a week, and conditioner every day.\n\nDon't be rough with your hair - the ends of your hairs can split, and like with the grain of a tree struck by lightning this crack will travel down your hair the more rough you are with it.\n\nThe solution to this is to get regular trims to cut the 'split ends' off before they proliferate.\n\nMore tips:\n\n-Don't brush your hair while it's wet, more friction and you'll pull out more hair. If you have to, be careful.\n\n-if you wash in the evenings, make sure to dry your hair fully before you sleep, friction with your pillow can weaken hair and you can even have a scalp/hair infection since damp & warm are the conditions for bacteria to grow (in that case, use an anti-fungal shampoo by the prescription)\n\n-replace your cotton/poly pillow case with a silk/satin one, less friction and perhaps more comfy\n\n-some say to avoid shampoos/conditioners with chemicals, go all natural with expensive vegan alternatives - though personally I find that there is little evidence that companies would knowingly produce bad hair products \ud83d\ude05\n\n-don't have showers that are very hot, this can damage your hair - keep it moderate temperature\n\n-don't leave your hair wet and go out in the cold, you'll just get brain-freeze lol\n\nThere are also subreddits about preventing male-pattern-baldness, seems like there's some medicines that are quite effective for that, but some come with major side affects like messing up your hormones, erectile dysfunction etc. Seems to me like taking good care of your hair in the first place is the best idea\n\nEdit; it's r/tressless I believe\n\nHope this helps.",

Find a balance, but start with doing it less than you're doing (ie move from every day to every other day, or every other day to every third day, etc) \n2. Put it up and wear a shower cap so that it doesn't get wet when you shower; getting soaked and then drying out will make it frizzy. \n3. Hot oil treatments will help a lot, but are not cheap (at a salon) and take a bit of practice (if done at home). As an alternative, buy repairing oil. I use one from L'Occitane, and because you're using a minuscule amount every week it lasts literal years. Start from the tips and work up toward the roots.\n4. Also obviously if you're bleaching, dyeing, or blow drying your hair, stop.",

Much like a good portion of men, you've been dealt a bad hand with your hairline - but that doesn't mean you can't look good.\n\nYour skin is clear and your eyes are bright, get a buzz cut and look younger. Make sure you continue to take care of your skin and teeth, exercise can help slim your face and accentuate your jawline. Learn about fashion - if you can't figure it out with online resources, talk to family or fashionable friends, even hire a designer with knowledge of what goes with what to your body type. Try out different shirts and hats, glasses even (blanks or sunglasses if you don't need a prescription). If you can you could even try and grow a beard.\n\nThere's lots you can do to improve your look, and the first thing to do would be to give yourself a buzz cut.\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nRust.",

You also do not *need* to wash your hair every day. \n\nTo my knowledge, an ideal hair routine would be to wash your hair with shampoo 2-3 times a week, and conditioner every day.\n\nDon't be rough with your hair - the ends of your hairs can split, and like with the grain of a tree struck by lightning this crack will travel down your hair the more rough you are with it.\n\nThe solution to this is to get regular trims to cut the 'split ends' off before they proliferate.\n\nMore tips:\n\n-Don't brush your hair while it's wet, more friction and you'll pull out more hair. If you have to, be careful.\n\n-if you wash in the evenings, make sure to dry your hair fully before you sleep, friction with your pillow can weaken hair and you can even have a scalp/hair infection since damp & warm are the conditions for bacteria to grow (in that case, use an anti-fungal shampoo by the prescription)\n\n-replace your cotton/poly pillow case with a silk/satin one, less friction and perhaps more comfy\n\n-some say to avoid shampoos/conditioners with chemicals, go all natural with expensive vegan alternatives - though personally I find that there is little evidence that companies would knowingly produce bad hair products \ud83d\ude05\n\n-don't have showers that are very hot, this can damage your hair - keep it moderate temperature\n\n-don't leave your hair wet and go out in the cold, you'll just get brain-freeze lol\n\nThere are also subreddits about preventing male-pattern-baldness, seems like there's some medicines that are quite effective for that, but some come with major side affects like messing up your hormones, erectile dysfunction etc. Seems to me like taking good care of your hair in the first place is the best idea\n\nEdit; it's r/tressless I believe\n\nHope this helps.",

Find a balance, but start with doing it less than you're doing (ie move from every day to every other day, or every other day to every third day, etc) \n2. Put it up and wear a shower cap so that it doesn't get wet when you shower; getting soaked and then drying out will make it frizzy. \n3. Hot oil treatments will help a lot, but are not cheap (at a salon) and take a bit of practice (if done at home). As an alternative, buy repairing oil. I use one from L'Occitane, and because you're using a minuscule amount every week it lasts literal years. Start from the tips and work up toward the roots.\n4. Also obviously if you're bleaching, dyeing, or blow drying your hair, stop.",

If you have to, be careful.\n\n-if you wash in the evenings, make sure to dry your hair fully before you sleep, friction with your pillow can weaken hair and you can even have a scalp/hair infection since damp & warm are the conditions for bacteria to grow (in that case, use an anti-fungal shampoo by the prescription)\n\n-replace your cotton/poly pillow case with a silk/satin one, less friction and perhaps more comfy\n\n-some say to avoid shampoos/conditioners with chemicals, go all natural with expensive vegan alternatives - though personally I find that there is little evidence that companies would knowingly produce bad hair products \ud83d\ude05\n\n-don't have showers that are very hot, this can damage your hair - keep it moderate temperature\n\n-don't leave your hair wet and go out in the cold, you'll just get brain-freeze lol\n\nThere are also subreddits about preventing male-pattern-baldness, seems like there's some medicines that are quite effective for that, but some come with major side affects like messing up your hormones, erectile dysfunction etc. Seems to me like taking good care of your hair in the first place is the best idea\n\nEdit; it's r/tressless I believe\n\nHope this helps.",

            "body": "1. You're probably washing it too much. Stop doing that. How often should you wash your hair? Sorry -- it depends on your skin and hair type. Find a balance, but start with doing it less than you're doing (ie move from every day to every other day, or every other day to every third day, etc) \n2. Put it up and wear a shower cap so that it doesn't get wet when you shower; getting soaked and then drying out will make it frizzy. \n3. Hot oil treatments will help a lot, but are not cheap (at a salon) and take a bit of practice (if done at home). As an alternative, buy repairing oil. I use one from L'Occitane, and because you're using a minuscule amount every week it lasts literal years. Start from the tips and work up toward the roots.\n4. Also obviously if you're bleaching, dyeing, or blow drying your hair, stop.",
