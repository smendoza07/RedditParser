The asian dudes I grew up with often used styling gel/mousse/spray and unique cuts to get cool styles. \n\nI've just done some basic googling, and there are so many awesome options for you my dude. There are some asian dudes on youtube and IG (IG is a great resource if you do some digging) that have cool hair styles that you could look into. \n\nThe great thing about being at the age you are is that you have the opportunity to choose the style that works for you. You just need to have the courage to try new things and put up with something that you may not like for a short time!",

Here's what it [looks like in the hair](http://imgur.com/a/E4KnA). \n\n* For a **shinier**, classic look; I'd suggest trying out [Lockhart's Goon Grease](http://imgur.com/a/gVMPb).

Mine is very similar to yours where I part the top to the side. If you don't mind me asking, do you have problems with the top staying up there? When I style my hair it naturally falls back down. Maybe I need to use more wax :|",

There are some asian dudes on youtube and IG (IG is a great resource if you do some digging) that have cool hair styles that you could look into. \n\nThe great thing about being at the age you are is that you have the opportunity to choose the style that works for you.
