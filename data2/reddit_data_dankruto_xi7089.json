Shadow clone users have to divide their Chakra evenly, so at the very least she'd notice he'd be at 50% chakra, without a plausible explanation. She just wouldn't be able to tell if the Naruto with her, was the \"prime\" Naruto. But based on how low on Chakra he was, she could make a guess as to what the likelihood was that she was with the prime Naruto. If he was at 1/4 Chakra, without plausible explanation, then she could guess that maybe there was a 25% chance this was the prime Naruto? \n\nThat said, I'm not sure if it really matters. The shadow clones are pretty sturdy, they have his personality and memories, and Naruto gets all their memories/knowledge back when they disperse. \n\nI think the only living person who could tell if it was a clone would be Sasuke, since he has an active rinnegan?",

And even if it were possible it doesn't say that it would be fine tuned enough to, for example, tell the difference between 20% Chakra and 30% Chakra levels. \n\nI'm not sure chakra signatures would be the same thing as Chakra quantities. And shadow clones have always been held apart as being superior/different from other types of clones, so maybe there's a limitation to it. \n\nI mentioned Sasuke and the rinnegan because the wiki claims Madara, with a rinnegan, was able to tell the difference. Maybe a byakugan can only see the flows/qualitative differences, but you need a rinnegan to see the finer quantitative differences?",

How many times has Naruto contemplated on how he could\u2019ve turned into Gaara or Sasuke had it not been for Iruka?\n\nNaruto just needed a friend.

Yeah, I get that she\u2019s shy, but the love she felt for Naruto seriously didn\u2019t amount to much if it couldn\u2019t push her to just be there for a love-starved child who really just needed a friend for 12 years.",

Her shyness was greater than her love for Naruto.\n\nApparently Kishimoto thought Hinata deserved to have her love rewarded, and that\u2019s why she got to be with Naruto, but\u2026 why? Her love didn\u2019t do anything for Naruto. Not for nearly 2 decades. Why does that deserve a reward?\n\nHinata\u2019s not the only person who risked their lives to protect Naruto. Sakura and Tsunade did too. Hinata didn\u2019t do anything that no other girl didn\u2019t also already do many years prior.\n\nIs Hinata supposed to win just because she liked him first? Liked him before he was a hero? I mean, sure, you liked him before he was even popular (\u2026), but I think it\u2019s just as bad (perhaps even worse) that you did like him but could ignore him while knowing how people treated him.\n\nAnd just as these girls are affectionate towards him now that he saved the world, Hinata ultimately fell for him because he saved her. All the positive qualities that these girls now get to see in Naruto (that he\u2019s brave and strong and heroic) are the same ones Hinata got to see many years ago.\n\nI guess my point is, Hinata didn\u2019t especially deserve a win. Not any more than Sakura or these girls. The movie portrays these girls as shallow and Hinata as \u201creal,\u201d but I see through that genjutsu.\n\nI think Naruto could\u2019ve done better than Hinata. Married at 19. Maaan. It\u2019s a fairy tale ending here, but geez. It\u2019s just not the same. Naruto should\u2019ve dated more. This sudden \u201cHinata is my true love\u201d plotline was so damn forced.",

But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka.

Remember, Hinata loved Naruto since they were maybe 4-5 when Naruto defended her against bullies, yet she never acted on it for 11-12 years. Not in a way that mitigated the loneliness that Naruto felt all his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the point in time when Hinata confessed in the Pain arc and the War arc, Naruto was already strong enough on his own and the loneliness wasn't killing him like it was in the past. People like Konohamaru and Ebisu were already willing to die for Naruto at that point. He was already a precious comrade. Not to mention he had Iruka, Jiraiya, and Team 7 as a family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHinata's existence wasn't expressly necessary for the most part when she finally started to make her presence known. All I'm saying is that Hinata is not in a more righteous position than the girls that are clinging to Naruto now. Hinata had the sneak preview of how good a person Naruto is. She got the chance to see him defend her and see him endure the problems in his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen the comments saying things like \"Hinata was there for Naruto BEFORE he was a hero.\" NO, SHE WASN'T. She was NOT there for Naruto. It doesn't mean anything to Naruto that you were watching him suffer all that time! He didn't know you were there. He was too busy suffering!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, I'm not saying Hinata doesn't have the right to love Naruto. But these girls are not shallow for loving Naruto now. At least, they aren't any more or less shallow than Hinata (since Hinata only started looking at him because he saved her, and because she saw him work hard and never give up). For all we know, that's exactly why these girls like Naruto now too! That he's strong and brave and never gave up and that he saved the world.",

He already stopped caring about her long before Kurenai recruited her.\n\nShe definitely had breathing room to meet with Naruto considering her own father stopped treating her as the heir.\n\nRegardless of that though, my point still stands. Hinata doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to pursue Naruto, and Naruto should\u2019ve given more girls a chance. Married at 19 is waaaaay too young.

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

If he did say that then i am shocked. Shows how shitty her dad and elders were. If there was any strict guidelines maybe they were still in place but if not then maybe she could have opened up more. If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration. God this is bringing back ptsd from kishi\u2019s rushed writing. I personally would have liked to see naruto with another kunoichi for some time and then end up with hinata. But the way they wrote hinata poor girl would have been broken lol.",

She'll friendzone herself and just be there for Naruto platonically. Eventually Naruto would see that Hinata's always there for him, and then they get together after a few years.

Shadow clone users have to divide their Chakra evenly, so at the very least she'd notice he'd be at 50% chakra, without a plausible explanation. She just wouldn't be able to tell if the Naruto with her, was the \"prime\" Naruto. But based on how low on Chakra he was, she could make a guess as to what the likelihood was that she was with the prime Naruto. If he was at 1/4 Chakra, without plausible explanation, then she could guess that maybe there was a 25% chance this was the prime Naruto? \n\nThat said, I'm not sure if it really matters. The shadow clones are pretty sturdy, they have his personality and memories, and Naruto gets all their memories/knowledge back when they disperse. \n\nI think the only living person who could tell if it was a clone would be Sasuke, since he has an active rinnegan?",

And even if it were possible it doesn't say that it would be fine tuned enough to, for example, tell the difference between 20% Chakra and 30% Chakra levels. \n\nI'm not sure chakra signatures would be the same thing as Chakra quantities. And shadow clones have always been held apart as being superior/different from other types of clones, so maybe there's a limitation to it. \n\nI mentioned Sasuke and the rinnegan because the wiki claims Madara, with a rinnegan, was able to tell the difference. Maybe a byakugan can only see the flows/qualitative differences, but you need a rinnegan to see the finer quantitative differences?",

Starved for it so much that they had to confirm their existence through violence.\n\nI swear the real savior of the ninja world is Iruka.

Yeah, I get that she\u2019s shy, but the love she felt for Naruto seriously didn\u2019t amount to much if it couldn\u2019t push her to just be there for a love-starved child who really just needed a friend for 12 years.",

Her shyness was greater than her love for Naruto.\n\nApparently Kishimoto thought Hinata deserved to have her love rewarded, and that\u2019s why she got to be with Naruto, but\u2026 why? Her love didn\u2019t do anything for Naruto. Not for nearly 2 decades. Why does that deserve a reward?\n\nHinata\u2019s not the only person who risked their lives to protect Naruto. Sakura and Tsunade did too. Hinata didn\u2019t do anything that no other girl didn\u2019t also already do many years prior.\n\nIs Hinata supposed to win just because she liked him first? Liked him before he was a hero? I mean, sure, you liked him before he was even popular (\u2026), but I think it\u2019s just as bad (perhaps even worse) that you did like him but could ignore him while knowing how people treated him.\n\nAnd just as these girls are affectionate towards him now that he saved the world, Hinata ultimately fell for him because he saved her. All the positive qualities that these girls now get to see in Naruto (that he\u2019s brave and strong and heroic) are the same ones Hinata got to see many years ago.\n\nI guess my point is, Hinata didn\u2019t especially deserve a win. Not any more than Sakura or these girls. The movie portrays these girls as shallow and Hinata as \u201creal,\u201d but I see through that genjutsu.\n\nI think Naruto could\u2019ve done better than Hinata. Married at 19. Maaan. It\u2019s a fairy tale ending here, but geez. It\u2019s just not the same. Naruto should\u2019ve dated more. This sudden \u201cHinata is my true love\u201d plotline was so damn forced.",

But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka.

She was NOT there for Naruto. It doesn't mean anything to Naruto that you were watching him suffer all that time! He didn't know you were there. He was too busy suffering!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, I'm not saying Hinata doesn't have the right to love Naruto. But these girls are not shallow for loving Naruto now. At least, they aren't any more or less shallow than Hinata (since Hinata only started looking at him because he saved her, and because she saw him work hard and never give up). For all we know, that's exactly why these girls like Naruto now too! That he's strong and brave and never gave up and that he saved the world.",

If you notice just like in reality parents can\u2019t baby you anymore once she reached teenhood  and as you seen she was able to go out more and interact with friends like the funny bathhouse episode where they all go to the bathhouse. I would argue that if she wasn\u2019t under the strictest family in konoha but come man, she did SOO much for him as much as she could. Like I\u2019m pretty sure she would get beat just for sneaking out and trying to have fun as a kid, or be seen hanging out with boys. She barely even got to interact with other villagers let alone the jinchuriki of the village.

Hinata doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to pursue Naruto, and Naruto should\u2019ve given more girls a chance. Married at 19 is waaaaay too young.

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration.

Shadow clone users have to divide their Chakra evenly, so at the very least she'd notice he'd be at 50% chakra, without a plausible explanation. She just wouldn't be able to tell if the Naruto with her, was the \"prime\" Naruto. But based on how low on Chakra he was, she could make a guess as to what the likelihood was that she was with the prime Naruto. If he was at 1/4 Chakra, without plausible explanation, then she could guess that maybe there was a 25% chance this was the prime Naruto? \n\nThat said, I'm not sure if it really matters. The shadow clones are pretty sturdy, they have his personality and memories, and Naruto gets all their memories/knowledge back when they disperse. \n\nI think the only living person who could tell if it was a clone would be Sasuke, since he has an active rinnegan?",

And even if it were possible it doesn't say that it would be fine tuned enough to, for example, tell the difference between 20% Chakra and 30% Chakra levels. \n\nI'm not sure chakra signatures would be the same thing as Chakra quantities. And shadow clones have always been held apart as being superior/different from other types of clones, so maybe there's a limitation to it. \n\nI mentioned Sasuke and the rinnegan because the wiki claims Madara, with a rinnegan, was able to tell the difference. Maybe a byakugan can only see the flows/qualitative differences, but you need a rinnegan to see the finer quantitative differences?",

Her shyness was greater than her love for Naruto.\n\nApparently Kishimoto thought Hinata deserved to have her love rewarded, and that\u2019s why she got to be with Naruto, but\u2026 why? Her love didn\u2019t do anything for Naruto. Not for nearly 2 decades. Why does that deserve a reward?\n\nHinata\u2019s not the only person who risked their lives to protect Naruto. Sakura and Tsunade did too. Hinata didn\u2019t do anything that no other girl didn\u2019t also already do many years prior.\n\nIs Hinata supposed to win just because she liked him first? Liked him before he was a hero? I mean, sure, you liked him before he was even popular (\u2026), but I think it\u2019s just as bad (perhaps even worse) that you did like him but could ignore him while knowing how people treated him.\n\nAnd just as these girls are affectionate towards him now that he saved the world, Hinata ultimately fell for him because he saved her. All the positive qualities that these girls now get to see in Naruto (that he\u2019s brave and strong and heroic) are the same ones Hinata got to see many years ago.\n\nI guess my point is, Hinata didn\u2019t especially deserve a win. Not any more than Sakura or these girls. The movie portrays these girls as shallow and Hinata as \u201creal,\u201d but I see through that genjutsu.\n\nI think Naruto could\u2019ve done better than Hinata. Married at 19. Maaan. It\u2019s a fairy tale ending here, but geez. It\u2019s just not the same. Naruto should\u2019ve dated more. This sudden \u201cHinata is my true love\u201d plotline was so damn forced.",

But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka. The first person Naruto clung to was Sasuke, and that only happened because Naruto was so lonely that he felt a breath of fresh air knowing someone's life maybe sucked as much as his did....",

The plot just started pushing him to Hinata, and it just felt so wrong. So ridiculous.",

Remember, Hinata loved Naruto since they were maybe 4-5 when Naruto defended her against bullies, yet she never acted on it for 11-12 years. Not in a way that mitigated the loneliness that Naruto felt all his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the point in time when Hinata confessed in the Pain arc and the War arc, Naruto was already strong enough on his own and the loneliness wasn't killing him like it was in the past. People like Konohamaru and Ebisu were already willing to die for Naruto at that point. He was already a precious comrade. Not to mention he had Iruka, Jiraiya, and Team 7 as a family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHinata's existence wasn't expressly necessary for the most part when she finally started to make her presence known. All I'm saying is that Hinata is not in a more righteous position than the girls that are clinging to Naruto now. Hinata had the sneak preview of how good a person Naruto is. She got the chance to see him defend her and see him endure the problems in his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen the comments saying things like \"Hinata was there for Naruto BEFORE he was a hero.\" NO, SHE WASN'T. She was NOT there for Naruto. It doesn't mean anything to Naruto that you were watching him suffer all that time! He didn't know you were there. He was too busy suffering!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, I'm not saying Hinata doesn't have the right to love Naruto. But these girls are not shallow for loving Naruto now. At least, they aren't any more or less shallow than Hinata (since Hinata only started looking at him because he saved her, and because she saw him work hard and never give up). For all we know, that's exactly why these girls like Naruto now too! That he's strong and brave and never gave up and that he saved the world.",

If you notice just like in reality parents can\u2019t baby you anymore once she reached teenhood  and as you seen she was able to go out more and interact with friends like the funny bathhouse episode where they all go to the bathhouse. I would argue that if she wasn\u2019t under the strictest family in konoha but come man, she did SOO much for him as much as she could. Like I\u2019m pretty sure she would get beat just for sneaking out and trying to have fun as a kid, or be seen hanging out with boys. She barely even got to interact with other villagers let alone the jinchuriki of the village. The only other person to root for naruto and have faith in him literally right behind iruka since the beginning even sakura and sasuke doubted naruto in the beginning.

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

If he did say that then i am shocked. Shows how shitty her dad and elders were. If there was any strict guidelines maybe they were still in place but if not then maybe she could have opened up more. If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration.

She could've eased his loneliness after essentially getting dumped by her family, but she was too shy apparently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLetting Naruto socialize with other girls after the war would probably be her penance to herself. She'll friendzone herself and just be there for Naruto platonically. Eventually Naruto would see that Hinata's always there for him, and then they get together after a few years. Then this relationship would've made sense.\n\nOh well, I always have my headcanon. This is why God made fanfiction.",

Naruto deserved to be the ladies man freaking over 10 years with no girl batting an eye and then all of a sudden he gets there and boom locked down. I think what would have been cool was if he met a girl journeying after the 4th war and meets her has a relationship with her, that way hinata wouldn\u2019t need to know and he learns what he likes in a woman, and they break it off become close friends and then eventually getting with hinata giving naruto a cool future \u201cwait you guys dated!?\u201d Scene in the future when that kunoichi would pop up and serve a point in the current plot. It sounds pretty epic. Kishimoto took the most boring route possible have to agree.",

Shadow clone users have to divide their Chakra evenly, so at the very least she'd notice he'd be at 50% chakra, without a plausible explanation. She just wouldn't be able to tell if the Naruto with her, was the \"prime\" Naruto. But based on how low on Chakra he was, she could make a guess as to what the likelihood was that she was with the prime Naruto. If he was at 1/4 Chakra, without plausible explanation, then she could guess that maybe there was a 25% chance this was the prime Naruto? \n\nThat said, I'm not sure if it really matters. The shadow clones are pretty sturdy, they have his personality and memories, and Naruto gets all their memories/knowledge back when they disperse. \n\nI think the only living person who could tell if it was a clone would be Sasuke, since he has an active rinnegan?",

And even if it were possible it doesn't say that it would be fine tuned enough to, for example, tell the difference between 20% Chakra and 30% Chakra levels. \n\nI'm not sure chakra signatures would be the same thing as Chakra quantities. And shadow clones have always been held apart as being superior/different from other types of clones, so maybe there's a limitation to it. \n\nI mentioned Sasuke and the rinnegan because the wiki claims Madara, with a rinnegan, was able to tell the difference. Maybe a byakugan can only see the flows/qualitative differences, but you need a rinnegan to see the finer quantitative differences?",

Her shyness was greater than her love for Naruto.\n\nApparently Kishimoto thought Hinata deserved to have her love rewarded, and that\u2019s why she got to be with Naruto, but\u2026 why? Her love didn\u2019t do anything for Naruto. Not for nearly 2 decades. Why does that deserve a reward?\n\nHinata\u2019s not the only person who risked their lives to protect Naruto. Sakura and Tsunade did too. Hinata didn\u2019t do anything that no other girl didn\u2019t also already do many years prior.\n\nIs Hinata supposed to win just because she liked him first? Liked him before he was a hero? I mean, sure, you liked him before he was even popular (\u2026), but I think it\u2019s just as bad (perhaps even worse) that you did like him but could ignore him while knowing how people treated him.\n\nAnd just as these girls are affectionate towards him now that he saved the world, Hinata ultimately fell for him because he saved her. All the positive qualities that these girls now get to see in Naruto (that he\u2019s brave and strong and heroic) are the same ones Hinata got to see many years ago.\n\nI guess my point is, Hinata didn\u2019t especially deserve a win. Not any more than Sakura or these girls. The movie portrays these girls as shallow and Hinata as \u201creal,\u201d but I see through that genjutsu.\n\nI think Naruto could\u2019ve done better than Hinata. Married at 19. Maaan. It\u2019s a fairy tale ending here, but geez. It\u2019s just not the same. Naruto should\u2019ve dated more. This sudden \u201cHinata is my true love\u201d plotline was so damn forced.",

But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka. The first person Naruto clung to was Sasuke, and that only happened because Naruto was so lonely that he felt a breath of fresh air knowing someone's life maybe sucked as much as his did....",

Remember, Hinata loved Naruto since they were maybe 4-5 when Naruto defended her against bullies, yet she never acted on it for 11-12 years. Not in a way that mitigated the loneliness that Naruto felt all his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the point in time when Hinata confessed in the Pain arc and the War arc, Naruto was already strong enough on his own and the loneliness wasn't killing him like it was in the past. People like Konohamaru and Ebisu were already willing to die for Naruto at that point. He was already a precious comrade. Not to mention he had Iruka, Jiraiya, and Team 7 as a family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHinata's existence wasn't expressly necessary for the most part when she finally started to make her presence known. All I'm saying is that Hinata is not in a more righteous position than the girls that are clinging to Naruto now. Hinata had the sneak preview of how good a person Naruto is. She got the chance to see him defend her and see him endure the problems in his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen the comments saying things like \"Hinata was there for Naruto BEFORE he was a hero.\" NO, SHE WASN'T. She was NOT there for Naruto. It doesn't mean anything to Naruto that you were watching him suffer all that time! He didn't know you were there. He was too busy suffering!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, I'm not saying Hinata doesn't have the right to love Naruto. But these girls are not shallow for loving Naruto now. At least, they aren't any more or less shallow than Hinata (since Hinata only started looking at him because he saved her, and because she saw him work hard and never give up). For all we know, that's exactly why these girls like Naruto now too! That he's strong and brave and never gave up and that he saved the world.",

At that point, Hinata wasn\u2019t the only one who accepted Naruto, and she wasn\u2019t the only one who risked his life for him.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m talking about how Hinata wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, I\u2019m talking about the majority of his childhood up until he starts hanging out with Iruka and finds family in Team 7 with Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi. Hinata only showed up after Naruto was already getting past the loneliest days of his life.",

Like i said she could only do so much for naruto being under the strictest family in konoha. Like neji\u2019s dad scenario was messed up that\u2019s how strict they are. If you notice just like in reality parents can\u2019t baby you anymore once she reached teenhood  and as you seen she was able to go out more and interact with friends like the funny bathhouse episode where they all go to the bathhouse. I would argue that if she wasn\u2019t under the strictest family in konoha but come man, she did SOO much for him as much as she could. Like I\u2019m pretty sure she would get beat just for sneaking out and trying to have fun as a kid, or be seen hanging out with boys. She barely even got to interact with other villagers let alone the jinchuriki of the village. The only other person to root for naruto and have faith in him literally right behind iruka since the beginning even sakura and sasuke doubted naruto in the beginning. I have to respectfully disagree.",

He already stopped caring about her long before Kurenai recruited her.\n\nShe definitely had breathing room to meet with Naruto considering her own father stopped treating her as the heir.\n\nRegardless of that though, my point still stands. Hinata doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to pursue Naruto, and Naruto should\u2019ve given more girls a chance. Married at 19 is waaaaay too young. And considering Naruto\u2019s social life really only got started after the 4th War ended, Naruto really got robbed a bachelor\u2019s life.",

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

If he did say that then i am shocked. Shows how shitty her dad and elders were. If there was any strict guidelines maybe they were still in place but if not then maybe she could have opened up more. If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration. God this is bringing back ptsd from kishi\u2019s rushed writing. I personally would have liked to see naruto with another kunoichi for some time and then end up with hinata.

And even if it were possible it doesn't say that it would be fine tuned enough to, for example, tell the difference between 20% Chakra and 30% Chakra levels. \n\nI'm not sure chakra signatures would be the same thing as Chakra quantities. And shadow clones have always been held apart as being superior/different from other types of clones, so maybe there's a limitation to it. \n\nI mentioned Sasuke and the rinnegan because the wiki claims Madara, with a rinnegan, was able to tell the difference. Maybe a byakugan can only see the flows/qualitative differences, but you need a rinnegan to see the finer quantitative differences?",

Her shyness was greater than her love for Naruto.\n\nApparently Kishimoto thought Hinata deserved to have her love rewarded, and that\u2019s why she got to be with Naruto, but\u2026 why? Her love didn\u2019t do anything for Naruto. Not for nearly 2 decades. Why does that deserve a reward?\n\nHinata\u2019s not the only person who risked their lives to protect Naruto. Sakura and Tsunade did too. Hinata didn\u2019t do anything that no other girl didn\u2019t also already do many years prior.\n\nIs Hinata supposed to win just because she liked him first? Liked him before he was a hero? I mean, sure, you liked him before he was even popular (\u2026), but I think it\u2019s just as bad (perhaps even worse) that you did like him but could ignore him while knowing how people treated him.\n\nAnd just as these girls are affectionate towards him now that he saved the world, Hinata ultimately fell for him because he saved her. All the positive qualities that these girls now get to see in Naruto (that he\u2019s brave and strong and heroic) are the same ones Hinata got to see many years ago.\n\nI guess my point is, Hinata didn\u2019t especially deserve a win. Not any more than Sakura or these girls. The movie portrays these girls as shallow and Hinata as \u201creal,\u201d but I see through that genjutsu.\n\nI think Naruto could\u2019ve done better than Hinata. Married at 19. Maaan. It\u2019s a fairy tale ending here, but geez. It\u2019s just not the same. Naruto should\u2019ve dated more. This sudden \u201cHinata is my true love\u201d plotline was so damn forced.",

But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka. The first person Naruto clung to was Sasuke, and that only happened because Naruto was so lonely that he felt a breath of fresh air knowing someone's life maybe sucked as much as his did....",

Remember, Hinata loved Naruto since they were maybe 4-5 when Naruto defended her against bullies, yet she never acted on it for 11-12 years. Not in a way that mitigated the loneliness that Naruto felt all his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the point in time when Hinata confessed in the Pain arc and the War arc, Naruto was already strong enough on his own and the loneliness wasn't killing him like it was in the past. People like Konohamaru and Ebisu were already willing to die for Naruto at that point. He was already a precious comrade. Not to mention he had Iruka, Jiraiya, and Team 7 as a family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHinata's existence wasn't expressly necessary for the most part when she finally started to make her presence known. All I'm saying is that Hinata is not in a more righteous position than the girls that are clinging to Naruto now. Hinata had the sneak preview of how good a person Naruto is. She got the chance to see him defend her and see him endure the problems in his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen the comments saying things like \"Hinata was there for Naruto BEFORE he was a hero.\" NO, SHE WASN'T. She was NOT there for Naruto. It doesn't mean anything to Naruto that you were watching him suffer all that time! He didn't know you were there. He was too busy suffering!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, I'm not saying Hinata doesn't have the right to love Naruto. But these girls are not shallow for loving Naruto now. At least, they aren't any more or less shallow than Hinata (since Hinata only started looking at him because he saved her, and because she saw him work hard and never give up). For all we know, that's exactly why these girls like Naruto now too! That he's strong and brave and never gave up and that he saved the world.",

If you notice just like in reality parents can\u2019t baby you anymore once she reached teenhood  and as you seen she was able to go out more and interact with friends like the funny bathhouse episode where they all go to the bathhouse. I would argue that if she wasn\u2019t under the strictest family in konoha but come man, she did SOO much for him as much as she could. Like I\u2019m pretty sure she would get beat just for sneaking out and trying to have fun as a kid, or be seen hanging out with boys. She barely even got to interact with other villagers let alone the jinchuriki of the village. The only other person to root for naruto and have faith in him literally right behind iruka since the beginning even sakura and sasuke doubted naruto in the beginning. I have to respectfully disagree.",

Hinata doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to pursue Naruto, and Naruto should\u2019ve given more girls a chance. Married at 19 is waaaaay too young. And considering Naruto\u2019s social life really only got started after the 4th War ended, Naruto really got robbed a bachelor\u2019s life.",

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

If he did say that then i am shocked. Shows how shitty her dad and elders were. If there was any strict guidelines maybe they were still in place but if not then maybe she could have opened up more. If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration. God this is bringing back ptsd from kishi\u2019s rushed writing. I personally would have liked to see naruto with another kunoichi for some time and then end up with hinata.

But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka.

Like i said she could only do so much for naruto being under the strictest family in konoha. Like neji\u2019s dad scenario was messed up that\u2019s how strict they are. If you notice just like in reality parents can\u2019t baby you anymore once she reached teenhood  and as you seen she was able to go out more and interact with friends like the funny bathhouse episode where they all go to the bathhouse. I would argue that if she wasn\u2019t under the strictest family in konoha but come man, she did SOO much for him as much as she could. Like I\u2019m pretty sure she would get beat just for sneaking out and trying to have fun as a kid, or be seen hanging out with boys. She barely even got to interact with other villagers let alone the jinchuriki of the village. The only other person to root for naruto and have faith in him literally right behind iruka since the beginning even sakura and sasuke doubted naruto in the beginning. I have to respectfully disagree.",

He already stopped caring about her long before Kurenai recruited her.\n\nShe definitely had breathing room to meet with Naruto considering her own father stopped treating her as the heir.\n\nRegardless of that though, my point still stands. Hinata doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to pursue Naruto, and Naruto should\u2019ve given more girls a chance. Married at 19 is waaaaay too young. And considering Naruto\u2019s social life really only got started after the 4th War ended, Naruto really got robbed a bachelor\u2019s life.",

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

Shows how shitty her dad and elders were. If there was any strict guidelines maybe they were still in place but if not then maybe she could have opened up more. If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration. God this is bringing back ptsd from kishi\u2019s rushed writing. I personally would have liked to see naruto with another kunoichi for some time and then end up with hinata.

All I'm saying is that Hinata watching Naruto deal with abandonment and hostile neglect does not put her at a morally higher ground in comparison to these girls who are clinging to Naruto now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI made my first comment because I remembered so many people saying that Hinata was the \"right\" choice as opposed to these \"shallow\" girls because she was there for Naruto before he was powerful, or before he was a hero. But that literally just is not true. She wasn't there for him. No one was there for him. The first person there for him was Iruka. The first person Naruto clung to was Sasuke, and that only happened because Naruto was so lonely that he felt a breath of fresh air knowing someone's life maybe sucked as much as his did....",

He already stopped caring about her long before Kurenai recruited her.\n\nShe definitely had breathing room to meet with Naruto considering her own father stopped treating her as the heir.\n\nRegardless of that though, my point still stands. Hinata doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to pursue Naruto, and Naruto should\u2019ve given more girls a chance. Married at 19 is waaaaay too young. And considering Naruto\u2019s social life really only got started after the 4th War ended, Naruto really got robbed a bachelor\u2019s life.",

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

And I said that Hinata was disowned around the time she was found useless after having lost to Neji when she was around 3-4 and then lost to Hanabi when she was around 8-9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know this because Hanabi is 5 years younger than Hinata and training for Hyuga apparently starts around 3-4. The kidnapping incident happened when Hinata was 3, but she got tossed aside and Hiashi literally tells Kurenai that he couldn't care less what happened to her (even after Kurenai says that it could be dangerous, and she could die) when she was 8-9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Hinata no longer mattered to Hyuga for 3-4 years. She could've spent time with Naruto in those years. Kishimoto definitely botched it, and I'm not saying Hinata absolutely shouldn't get with Naruto, but I just think Naruto could've waited a bit before committing. This is moot point anyway, I suppose. The only reason I make this argument is because realistically relationships are not as simple as soulmate magic. Naruto and Hinata have very little history.",

Shows how shitty her dad and elders were. If there was any strict guidelines maybe they were still in place but if not then maybe she could have opened up more. If you notice as the series progressed kishimoto did a sloppy job with developing side characters, but i feel like he bit off more than he can chew definitely acknowledged by diehard fans. As for the last part honestly i guess i definitely agree to an extent. I think naruto deserved to have more fun, being that he goes straight to a family and being the busiest man in the village. I have to admit i wish that naruto did at least date other woman. Sasuke was always the ladies man and naruto was hated forever until he became the village chad. If kishi was better at writing relationships it would have been cool for naruto to meet another girl and have a little triangle for some time. They probably already boruto in the chamber and just rushed the end which everyone noticed they rushed everything. I hate we didn\u2019t get the hokage inauguration. God this is bringing back ptsd from kishi\u2019s rushed writing. I personally would have liked to see naruto with another kunoichi for some time and then end up with hinata.

She\u2019s still a princess and oldest pure blood and extremely important as we seen and her bloodline is crucial to the hyuga. so i call BS on the 100% disowned. We can easily say that it was essential and inevitable for neji to prove the main branch that the side and main branch do not matter and they are all important. It was key in the development of the old generation to be humbled and respect each other as one for nejis development. I mean toneri was collecting byukugans to harvest the tenseigan, and byukugans are still an S rank gekkei gengkai. Like the mist ninja who has one stolen byukugan, it was important to keep the eyes safe and even worse with hinata being a pureblood are you gonna not mention that hinata was snatched out of her bed and almost kidnapped lol?, you\u2019re tripping. And then we have to ask ourselves was it hinata\u2019s doing or kishimotos bad love writing which he openly admitted multiple times that he struggled writing love relationships within the narutoverse which i feel was more of that being the case. I think naruto having a bachelor phase would have killed his relationship with hinata. Yes 19 is young, but as rushed as it was for some people it was the best developed relationship in the naruto series which tells us that kishimoto dropped the ball on the love aspect but i think hinata was the right call and he left enough breadcrumbs for people to believe it. This isn\u2019t 2022 where people get their junk off until they want to settle down lol its very traditional in case you didn\u2019t notice that no one\u2019s sexually active until they\u2019re married in the series.",

I think what would have been cool was if he met a girl journeying after the 4th war and meets her has a relationship with her, that way hinata wouldn\u2019t need to know and he learns what he likes in a woman, and they break it off become close friends and then eventually getting with hinata giving naruto a cool future \u201cwait you guys dated!?\u201d Scene in the future when that kunoichi would pop up and serve a point in the current plot.

NH and SS are both sh\\*t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf The Last was supposed to make more sense of NH, then it did a piss poor job, because now I just think Naruto really should've just started hanging out with the girls who were clinging to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe seriously got married at 19 before ever really dating, before ever really knowing Hinata, and before getting to know other people. I'm not even suggesting that Naruto bed half the ladies in Konoha or anything. I'm just saying that he narrowed down to one person WAAAAY too fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe didn't give anyone else a chance. The plot just started pushing him to Hinata, and it just felt so wrong. So ridiculous.",
