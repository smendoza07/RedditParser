    "body": "My SD agreed upon my allowance, which is apparently significantly higher than what the average SD\u2019s offer, from the accounts I hear, and it allowed for a full coverage of my expenses and left room for my savings and \u201cspoilings\u201d. Since we\u2019ve been seeing each other, he\u2019s now consistently increased it and is giving me substantially more than we originally agreed upon, which is amazing and so appreciated especially given the current climate and circumstances. He has given me the best reassurance and wants me to not worry or stress in the least, it\u2019s such a relief to know I can count on him and the best feeling to see how he truly enjoys taking care of me. \ud83e\udd70",

It will make all the difference, but yes, there are genuinely good men out there who appreciate a beautiful woman and her company and everything she brings into his life... and they are not afraid to show it. So keep focused on that! If a man is not up to your standards or making you happy, you are allowed to continue on your search, both need to be happy.",

I\u2019m still with him, but no... not him. He has not wanted to move to an allowance yet, and his schedule is a bit erratic so it doesn\u2019t make for something secure. He is wonderful and we genuinely love the time we spent together, but it can be difficult since his support is not always reliable. \n\nIt\u2019s actually a different one that I have been talking to for a bit, no intimacy (yet... he\u2019s extremely respectful). He\u2019s a bit older 39, very fit and looks like he\u2019s in his twenties, fair skin jet black hair/eyebrows dark eyes, very handsome, from Dubai.  He\u2019s new in the United States, here for a year on business... he has a great job, but his wealth comes from investing. His English isn\u2019t the greatest and he compares me to all the most beautiful and exotic/expensive animals in the world which I think is funny, but kind of sweet in a peculiar way. I think it\u2019s been difficult for him to find a SB so he wants to show me how much he values our friendship (his words). He also wants me to consider moving to Dubai and expand my career options there, but... that\u2019s a different story all together.",

I\u2019m still with him, but no... not him. He has not wanted to move to an allowance yet, and his schedule is a bit erratic so it doesn\u2019t make for something secure. He is wonderful and we genuinely love the time we spent together, but it can be difficult since his support is not always reliable. \n\nIt\u2019s actually a different one that I have been talking to for a bit, no intimacy (yet... he\u2019s extremely respectful). He\u2019s a bit older 39, very fit and looks like he\u2019s in his twenties, fair skin jet black hair/eyebrows dark eyes, very handsome, from Dubai.  He\u2019s new in the United States, here for a year on business... he has a great job, but his wealth comes from investing. His English isn\u2019t the greatest and he compares me to all the most beautiful and exotic/expensive animals in the world which I think is funny, but kind of sweet in a peculiar way. I think it\u2019s been difficult for him to find a SB so he wants to show me how much he values our friendship (his words). He also wants me to consider moving to Dubai and expand my career options there, but... that\u2019s a different story all together.",
