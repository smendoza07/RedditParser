Especially and SB that wants to have the the lifestyle, but has characteristics that will make the probability of their success very low.  In these cases, the truth may be their best answer and they may spend their time better looking for a 2nd job than looking for an SD.  \n\nIt's like somebody that wants to be an NBA basketball player, but it is clear they don't have the skills.  I don't want to be the one to destroy somebodies dreams, but at some point they need to know reality.",

Hopefully the relationship provides much broader benefits than just the allowance.  The true test probably comes in 10 years when the SB looks back on the relationship either with a smile thinking it was crazy but good for the time or  how could I have put up with that asshole.",

I just am concerned when we give people with a very little chance of success false hopes.  We can give them realistic chances and let them decide on the risk.\n\nTelling people they have a low chance of success will draw major criticism from this forum.

SA  was made possible by the internet and granted a near monopoly when the feds moved against many of the other sites, online places such as new times etc. The near extermination of on the job relationships through culture and lawsuits took away both a lot of casual consensual sex and sugar relationships. \n\nIf the goal of sugaring is  a) to receive economic benefits   b) to be treated well and C) to have a long relationship  I think the most likely SB to achieve that package of goals is a reasonably attractive, intelligent, happy, reliable.

I personally have no problem with that, but it's not what I seek, and a lot of people here prefer to act like it's different. And I really don't care about that until I see PPM people talking about people not being \"real\" SDs. You know who isn't a \"real\" SD? A PPM guy. He's a John. That said, it all comes down to communication. If both sides are open and honest about what they are looking for and capable of providing then things should be fine. The problem is that not everyone who is in the \"bowl\" is of high moral character. There are people looking to get over on others on both sides in this world - and probably more of them than honorable folks, to be honest - which makes everything more challenging. I think the point that was being made was that just like in any arrangement, there is something for everybody. If the person takes care of your needs, spoils you, cares about you and respects you - and you like them and enjoy spending time with them - why do we have to say they're not a \"real\" SD because they aren't a millionaire? On the other hand if they are providing some support, but playing games and not doing everything they promised or promised more than they are capable of, then that's a fair assessment.\n\nADDED: If the PPM guy also is there for the SB and pays bills when she is in need and provides other types of support beyond the PPM as requested or as needed, then I wouldn't want to say that person isn't a \"real\" SD either. My statement was too general. Obviously their relationship is more than pay for play. Apologies for that. The guy going from girl to girl shelling out $XXX PPM for intimacy is not a \"real\" SD. And I would say that if a SB is meeting multiple guys on a pretty regular basis for a PPM rate, she is not a \"real\" SB either. But to say that others who build relationships within their means that are acceptable and make someone happy and help them live a better life are \"real\" SDs. The terms of their arrangements are none of our business and shouldn't be judged.",

If you can find an SR even though you're ugly, you're still an SB.\n\nAnd yes it does work both ways. A guy who's in an SR and paying less than you think he should is still an SD.

Everyone has to qualify it and in that case the term itself is meaningless.\n\nDecades ago, sugar daddy had a specific meaning; viz. an older, very successful man, usually one who had already raised a family - because back in the day it was unusual to reach the ripe old age of forty without having older children. I'd vote for childless men in their twenties and thirties to come up with a better term for themselves than to co-opt and dilute SD.",

The reason I say this is because the point of sugar dating is to have some semblance of a relationship, not just a one time pump-and-dump whenever you have some extra money to spend, like gambling winnings, a tax refund, or a stimulus check. With that said, if a SB is fine with a one-off meetup; is fine with a relatively low allowance; or agrees to meetup very infrequently; and you have expressed that's what the arrangement is, then go for it.\n\nIn general, if you make \"just\" 100k a year (double the avg. income), you'd be stretched pretty thin trying to maintain a 1k a month PPM/Allowance. If you have a place, you better own it. If you have a car, you better own it too. Cause if you're paying rent and lease payments on a Porsche, you'd literally have less than 2k a month to spend utilities, insurances, gas, food, entertainment, etc. after you've paid your 1k allowance/PPM.\n\nLet me tell you how I lived when I was making 130k a year. My rent and student loan payments were about 5k total per month. That left me about 2.5k to pay my car payment (Honda Fit), utilities, phone, gas, insurance(s), food and entertainment. Nowhere in there was 1k to have a PPM/Allowance with a SB. A 130k salary is low for the SD realm, but in the regular world, that's almost 3x the average person's salary.",

Hopefully the relationship provides much broader benefits than just the allowance.  The true test probably comes in 10 years when the SB looks back on the relationship either with a smile thinking it was crazy but good for the time or  how could I have put up with that asshole.",

I personally have no problem with that, but it's not what I seek, and a lot of people here prefer to act like it's different. And I really don't care about that until I see PPM people talking about people not being \"real\" SDs. You know who isn't a \"real\" SD? A PPM guy. He's a John. That said, it all comes down to communication. If both sides are open and honest about what they are looking for and capable of providing then things should be fine. The problem is that not everyone who is in the \"bowl\" is of high moral character. There are people looking to get over on others on both sides in this world - and probably more of them than honorable folks, to be honest - which makes everything more challenging. I think the point that was being made was that just like in any arrangement, there is something for everybody. If the person takes care of your needs, spoils you, cares about you and respects you - and you like them and enjoy spending time with them - why do we have to say they're not a \"real\" SD because they aren't a millionaire? On the other hand if they are providing some support, but playing games and not doing everything they promised or promised more than they are capable of, then that's a fair assessment.\n\nADDED: If the PPM guy also is there for the SB and pays bills when she is in need and provides other types of support beyond the PPM as requested or as needed, then I wouldn't want to say that person isn't a \"real\" SD either. My statement was too general. Obviously their relationship is more than pay for play. Apologies for that. The guy going from girl to girl shelling out $XXX PPM for intimacy is not a \"real\" SD. And I would say that if a SB is meeting multiple guys on a pretty regular basis for a PPM rate, she is not a \"real\" SB either. But to say that others who build relationships within their means that are acceptable and make someone happy and help them live a better life are \"real\" SDs. The terms of their arrangements are none of our business and shouldn't be judged.",

If you can find an SR even though you're ugly, you're still an SB.\n\nAnd yes it does work both ways. A guy who's in an SR and paying less than you think he should is still an SD. Whether you think he is or not doesn't mean shit. It's not up to you.",

Mind you I am 100% Italian and we live in SF  amongst dozens of amazing restaurants that I could walk to... yet we would drive 25 minutes to a mall in Daly City to eat at the OG.   \n\nHad another SB from way Northern CA near my farm in Humbolt County.  Think super hot hill billy like Jessica Simpson in the Dukes of Hazard remake.   She loved Black Bear Diner.  \n\nThe reality of sugar dating vs what many think it would be like is very different.

Hopefully the relationship provides much broader benefits than just the allowance.

And sorting through a bunch of people who don't belong is a poor use of my time and energy.\n\nMore choice is only good if the options are all good options. But to be frank, there are a lot of women who aren't cut out to be SBs, and there are a lot of men who can't afford to be SDs. I don't see the point in diluting the pool with bad options. Why have a bunch of wannabe-SBs will grow frustrated on the sidelines (or worse, be scammed), and why have a bunch of wannabe-SDs set themselves up for financial ruin? So that more people can have piss-poor experiences trying to sugar date? That's nonsense.",

I personally have no problem with that, but it's not what I seek, and a lot of people here prefer to act like it's different. And I really don't care about that until I see PPM people talking about people not being \"real\" SDs. You know who isn't a \"real\" SD? A PPM guy. He's a John. That said, it all comes down to communication. If both sides are open and honest about what they are looking for and capable of providing then things should be fine. The problem is that not everyone who is in the \"bowl\" is of high moral character. There are people looking to get over on others on both sides in this world - and probably more of them than honorable folks, to be honest - which makes everything more challenging. I think the point that was being made was that just like in any arrangement, there is something for everybody. If the person takes care of your needs, spoils you, cares about you and respects you - and you like them and enjoy spending time with them - why do we have to say they're not a \"real\" SD because they aren't a millionaire? On the other hand if they are providing some support, but playing games and not doing everything they promised or promised more than they are capable of, then that's a fair assessment.\n\nADDED: If the PPM guy also is there for the SB and pays bills when she is in need and provides other types of support beyond the PPM as requested or as needed, then I wouldn't want to say that person isn't a \"real\" SD either. My statement was too general. Obviously their relationship is more than pay for play. Apologies for that. The guy going from girl to girl shelling out $XXX PPM for intimacy is not a \"real\" SD. And I would say that if a SB is meeting multiple guys on a pretty regular basis for a PPM rate, she is not a \"real\" SB either. But to say that others who build relationships within their means that are acceptable and make someone happy and help them live a better life are \"real\" SDs. The terms of their arrangements are none of our business and shouldn't be judged.",

If you can find an SR even though you're ugly, you're still an SB.\n\nAnd yes it does work both ways. A guy who's in an SR and paying less than you think he should is still an SD. Whether you think he is or not doesn't mean shit. It's not up to you.",

Think super hot hill billy like Jessica Simpson in the Dukes of Hazard remake.   She loved Black Bear Diner.  \n\nThe reality of sugar dating vs what many think it would be like is very different.

I personally have no problem with that, but it's not what I seek, and a lot of people here prefer to act like it's different. And I really don't care about that until I see PPM people talking about people not being \"real\" SDs. You know who isn't a \"real\" SD? A PPM guy. He's a John. That said, it all comes down to communication. If both sides are open and honest about what they are looking for and capable of providing then things should be fine. The problem is that not everyone who is in the \"bowl\" is of high moral character. There are people looking to get over on others on both sides in this world - and probably more of them than honorable folks, to be honest - which makes everything more challenging. I think the point that was being made was that just like in any arrangement, there is something for everybody. If the person takes care of your needs, spoils you, cares about you and respects you - and you like them and enjoy spending time with them - why do we have to say they're not a \"real\" SD because they aren't a millionaire? On the other hand if they are providing some support, but playing games and not doing everything they promised or promised more than they are capable of, then that's a fair assessment.\n\nADDED: If the PPM guy also is there for the SB and pays bills when she is in need and provides other types of support beyond the PPM as requested or as needed, then I wouldn't want to say that person isn't a \"real\" SD either. My statement was too general. Obviously their relationship is more than pay for play. Apologies for that. The guy going from girl to girl shelling out $XXX PPM for intimacy is not a \"real\" SD. And I would say that if a SB is meeting multiple guys on a pretty regular basis for a PPM rate, she is not a \"real\" SB either. But to say that others who build relationships within their means that are acceptable and make someone happy and help them live a better life are \"real\" SDs. The terms of their arrangements are none of our business and shouldn't be judged.",
