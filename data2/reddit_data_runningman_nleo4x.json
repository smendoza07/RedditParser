He is the one always taking the lost for hilarious moments instead of trying to go for the win.\n\nIt is way harder to consistently sing bad like what he's doing here than sing normally lol\n\nIf you just look at the teams that they were split into, you knew who was going to win in this scenario.  He just manages to make losing so damn funny.  In the end, he probably sees making us viewers laugh is more of a win than actually winning the games presented to him.  His talent in running man will be missed hugely",
