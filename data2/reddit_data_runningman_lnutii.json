That's different from falling into the pool (it was at the end of the episode where they were standing on boards and got dropped in the water if they got the answer wrong). Don't they always have divers around in these situations? Not meaning she didn't experience trauma! Just wondering how factual 'nearly drowning' is. \n\nIt's terrible it caused her that much trauma.
