I was literally paying someone $20 to cut off my sideburns and clean up my neck line (you can imagine how both looked after 5 months without a haircut). I assumed I didn't need a picture or even care who cut my hair.  I of course got the worst barber in the shop (it was my first time there and the guy I wanted to try wasn't working, but this other guy was finishing up an amazing haircut when I walked in so I assumed I'd get him because the shitty guy hadn't even started his cut yet. Oh no when the guy getting his haircut was done he decided \"lol I think I want it a little shorter!\" So I got the shitty guy). Any way I told the guy to just trim up my neckline and take like a 2 over my sideburns because and I quote \"I'm growing out my hair like Michael Douglas\". apparently a 22-25 year old guy doesn't know who that is. He also cuts my hair with me facing away from the mirror (which every barber does for some reason) so I have no idea what he's doing but I definitely know he's cutting my sides with scissors and shaving shit lmao. Anyways I end up getting what looks like a low taper about 2 inches above one ear down and a low taper about 1 inch above the other ear down (seriously uneven) oh and my sides are now trimmed down about 2-3 inches to the point they no longer stay down. Dude looked at me like he gave me the best haircut ever after lmao. It didn't even look good for a single day. ",
