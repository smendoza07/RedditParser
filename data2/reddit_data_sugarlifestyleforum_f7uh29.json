    "body": "There is a TL;DR at the end!\n\nSome time ago I posted on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/e1zds5/what_do_you_get_the_man_who_has_everything_need/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) asking for some advice on what to get my SD for Christmas (now I know he celebrates Hanukkah...oops). You guys gave me amazing advice, and he loved the gifts I gave him. \n\nFast forward to today. We have been dating for 6 months now, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. The only recurring issue was wondering what I get this man for his birthday!? So, I went back to the original post for inspiration and kept seeing suggestions that I buy him a bottle of mezcal (which he loves). \n\nI put some money aside to purchase two bottles of mezcal that I know he drinks regularly\u2014mind you both cost hundreds of dollars. But then I thought, if I\u2019m already going to spend a good amount I might as well get creative with it. \n\nThe idea came to me in a dream. Or maybe when I was in the subway. It could have been on the toilet. I can\u2019t remember. Anyway, I decided to hire a mariachi band to burst into his company and perform around the office. They\u2019ll then get to his office where they will serenade him with songs that I personally picked (I\u2019ve logged like 100 hours of mariachi music on YouTube trying to find the perfect ones). They will give him a card with instructions to go downstairs and get in a car that is waiting for him. That car will drive him to a restaurant that has one of the best/largest mezcal selections in NYC, where I will be waiting for him\u2014shots in hand. \n\nThere were obviously some logistical things that I needed to work out. Like I had to make an awkward call to HR and his secretary to see if it was okay to have a mariachi band pop up and make sure he didn\u2019t have any meetings scheduled after. I also had to like prove who I was, because they didn\u2019t automatically believe me when I told them I was the child bride/girlfriend-ish of a 50-something year old CEO. Go figure.\n\nAnyway, this is all taking place in a few days! I\u2019ll let you guys know how it goes! \n\nTL;DR: You guys suggested I get him mezcal for Christmas so I got a mariachi band at his office and mezcal at a restaurant for his birthday.\n\nEdit: He has never been married and exclusively dates women in their 20s and most people (friends, family, colleagues, employees) are aware. So it wasn\u2019t a shock that a much younger woman was calling his company. They were more shocked that I cared enough to do something elaborate for his birthday.\n\nEdit: Thank you to anonymous for the Gold Award! It\u2019s my first one! And to everyone else I will be updating by Wednesday.\n\nEDIT: [UPDATE!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/fa1lm4/update_surprising_my_sd_with_a_mariachi_band_at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

He probably doesn't want all of his employees incredibly distracted by his personal life\n4.
