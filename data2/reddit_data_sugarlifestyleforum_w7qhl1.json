    "body": "I am 5\u20197 and 140lbs.  While hooking up, my SD grabbed my stomach and said I need to go to the gym more.  I\u2019m not as fit as I was when I was younger but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fat.  And my SD certainly isn\u2019t athletic.  Should I hit the gym and eat better or dump my SD?",

In the vast majority of cases it absolutely will tell you if you are overweight or underweight. OP clearly has a belly since he was able to grab it to begin with. It is all fine, it's not a judgement.\n\nAll I am saying is that if we are using BMI, which I didn't bring up,  that she is not at all closer to underweight than overweight.

I\u2019m guessing OP is lying about 140 lbs, too.  My girl did catfish a little with old pics, filters, and angles, and she was insecure about it.  She told me she doesn\u2019t take any negative comments well though.  I just didn\u2019t provide as much reassurance as she wanted, so she asked to go to the gym and diet together, and we\u2019re doing that now.\n\nSure this guy is an idiot, but also, my girl handled the situation better than OP.

I can\u2019t even imagine that *during sex*, that\u2019s next level social problems if he didn\u2019t realize that would kill the mood.\n\nShe could talk to this guy directly about how he made her feel, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d get an apology, right?  He\u2019s direct and complains about something, she can do the same.  If he doesn\u2019t take it well, then she can bail.  It\u2019s pretty messed up to bail on someone with no discussion because your feelings are hurt, when literally the reason the person is paying money is because they have poorly developed social skills.  OP\u2019s got issues too if she can\u2019t talk to someone who offended her.  That\u2019s immature.\n\n> not overweight AT ALL\n\nShe said she\u2019s put on weight, doesn\u2019t eat healthy, or exercise.  \n\n> doesn\u2019t reference having a belly\n\nWhat did he grab, then?  You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

You should know way better in your generation not to talk to women like that.\n\nJust cause you're 36 doesn't mean you don't have eyebags or a double chin or messed up teeth.  \n\nMy therapy is going great. It's helped me learn even more about toxic people like you.\n\nYou have no idea what I even mean by whispers and petals.. it def has nothing to do with who I am.\n\nTelling a guy he shouldn't talk to a girl like thst is not negative. It's very positive. People need to stand up for each other and help change this world. Including by speaking up to a guy who is mistreating the girl he's dating.",

I did nothing wrong.  She asked me for reassurance on her body, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable giving it, so I didn\u2019t.  Now she wants to go to the gym with me and join my diet, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.  It was all her idea.  Explain how that\u2019s so awful?\n\nProbably 100+ people read what I wrote, 20 downvoted, but you\u2014 you lashed out with insults you intended to be hurtful.  I showed you an example of girls saying I\u2019m truly amazing for their mental health, and you respond by doubling down, replying three times in a row to my message, with more hate.  You can\u2019t think about it and reconsider?  Out of 100+ people, you were the nastiest.  Props to you for standing up for what you believe in, but maybe you should double check what you believe.  And maybe you should show this exchange to your therapist and talk it over.  What does she think about what I wrote, and how you handled it?",

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

I go to the gym to get a damn WORKOUT, which is WHY I GO HARD.  I don't take ppl with me, bc I don't expect them to demand the same kind of physical workout out of theirselves, that I WILL push myself to do.\n\n2.  I'm NOT in the gym, for anyone else who is there, so my competition while I am there, IS ME.\nI've spent long enough physically training, to know where my heartbeat needs to stay, in order to be in the burning cals range.  \nI'm not in the gym to score someone or to have someone try and hit on me, I'm there to break a sweat and make my ass look irresistible.",

I can\u2019t carry 100 lb rucksacks up mountains like I used to, but I refuse to get fat.  The girls can\u2019t hang with me on pushing iron, but I\u2019ve never expected them to.  I\u2019ve coached them on what different machines are for and how to use them, but despite my years of experience working out and designing fitness training programs for guys (I went to a military school for that) I\u2019m not a personal fitness trainer and I\u2019m not current on the latest developments in physiology and fitness training, so I hired PFTs to work with the girls when I first got them memberships.  I enjoy spending time with them in the gym and seeing their gains, but probably the biggest benefit for them is that random guys don\u2019t try to hit on them while working out with me.\n\nI absolutely would want to go to the gym with you.  The endorphin rush would be nice, and working out with someone new always motivates me to push harder.",

Heck, I recall a very good friend of mine once was complaining how she had gained a little weight and wanted to lose like ten pounds, and I had just seen her after not seeing her in a while and I had just commented that I did notice it.  I didn't say anything else, just that I basically noticed what she herself brought up and was complaining about.  She got soooo mad at me for saying that.  From that I have a general rule I simply won't say anything at all about a woman's weight.  Even if she asks me directly.  (Think Admiral Ackbar - it's a trap!)\n\nUltimately, if that is important to him, he would likely end the SR at some point if it wasn't addressed.  And in that case, better he said something about it and let you know and gave you time to decide what to do about it than to just end it without saying why or even without giving you a chance to address it.  \n\nLike it or lump it, having a nice, toned body is probably what most SDs like in a SB.",

So if you have a lot of muscle and little fat, you could look very slim and toned as compared to someone else of the same height who is completely out of shape and all of their weight is fat, not muscle.  \n\nPretty much any time any woman anywhere is told to lose weight, the person doing so is going to be accused of lowering her self esteem or doing something equally nefarious.

He's paying her to be his SB.  If he is not happy with what he is getting, he will end it and she will not get paid.  So that is always going to be part of any SR.  \n\nMaybe he didn't realize exactly how it would feel being with her til they were naked together and he saw how she looked and also felt how she felt when intimate.  You never quite know how that will be until you get to that point.  And maybe he just would prefer she lose just a little weight to be his ideal.  Again, while I wouldn't want to have that conversation (It's a trap) I can see how some SDs might.  The primary thing they are paying for is a woman's beauty.  You can sugar coat it all you like, but it is the simple truth.  And over time that beauty tends to decay, both with age and, if someone isn't careful, with putting on weight.  Maybe she actually has put on a few pounds since they started.  \n\nThe simple fact is, if he prefers her to be slimmer to feel desire toward her, he is going to feel that whether he says anything about it or not.  Which is better?  He says nothing and just breaks it off, or he says something and gives her at least the option to do something about it or decide not to and she could even break it off?\n\nSRs can be very personal and that is when they are best, but at the end of the day, they are a business relationship.  You need to have a thick skin to handle business relationships in any context, but especially in the SR context.  Can't let emotions get in the way when you are talking about the business end of it.  For the men, that is the money.  For the women, that is the beauty and intimacy aspect.  \n\nStill, one shouldn't be insensitive either.  And really, I agree with you that it is better to just not start a SR with someone who doesn't meet your requirements than to start one and try to change them.",

That\u2019s a him problem, not a you problem. Never take things too personally in the lifestyle. However, a sugar baby needs to maintain herself pretty well. Make him pay for a personal trainer and some meal prep service for you. I find that his comment would\u2019ve been unacceptable in a vanilla relationship, but this is not that. Just ignore it and move on, you are definitely way out of his league regardless if you have a few extra pounds or not.",

His is to financially support you make you feel loved, and beautiful, guide you, care for you etc. etc..... Your role, is to keep him feeling Young and vibrant, full of life! Your beauty is a symbol of what you bring to the table, in a sugar lifestyle... Have you considered that he might think of someone else? that you are not the only person with power in this situation? A little more gym time would certainly make you more competitive in the field, and less likely to get dumped yourself. I don't mean those to be harsh words, just to give you a different perspective to think about... It seems to me you are destined for the gym one way or the other if you intend to maintain life as a sugar baby, much longer with him or without him as you will have to tone up to catch a new one if you dump him.

I\u2019m guessing OP is lying about 140 lbs, too.  My girl did catfish a little with old pics, filters, and angles, and she was insecure about it.

He\u2019s direct and complains about something, she can do the same.  If he doesn\u2019t take it well, then she can bail.

You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

People pursue the sugar lifestyle for lots of reasons.\n\nI would also like to clarify she didn't say she \"put on weight\" she just said she isn't quite as fit as she used to be. I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

Everyone\u2019s jumping to this dumb conclusion of \u201cno he\u2019s evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot quite as fit\u201d definitely means she put on weight, though.  There\u2019s really no other interpretation.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean everyone needs a 6 pack, my bad if it came across that way.  My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

Don't get with her only to judge her and dislike minor imperfections and get her to change something about herself. \nThere's many girls out there. Go for someone who already has what you like.

But like\u2026 OP should tell him that.  communication is a thing, use your words.  Ghosting culture is toxic.  If you care about other girls, you should *definitely* agree with me.  Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

Even made a comment that was a bit racist, something along the lines of \u201cblack girls are so demanding, this girl asked me for 10k a month, I make that much\u201d He was such a stupid shithead, not a real sugar daddy at all.

I spent 28 years jumping out of planes and shooting guns, and men were judged on their fitness and their ability to complete the mission.  I\u2019m busted up with injuries but I can still run 5 miles in 40 minutes and keep my heart rate over 160 for most of a 30 minute session on a rower.  I can\u2019t carry 100 lb rucksacks up mountains like I used to, but I refuse to get fat.  The girls can\u2019t hang with me on pushing iron, but I\u2019ve never expected them to.  I\u2019ve coached them on what different machines are for and how to use them, but despite my years of experience working out and designing fitness training programs for guys (I went to a military school for that) I\u2019m not a personal fitness trainer and I\u2019m not current on the latest developments in physiology and fitness training, so I hired PFTs to work with the girls when I first got them memberships.  I enjoy spending time with them in the gym and seeing their gains, but probably the biggest benefit for them is that random guys don\u2019t try to hit on them while working out with me.\n\nI absolutely would want to go to the gym with you.  The endorphin rush would be nice, and working out with someone new always motivates me to push harder.",

He's paying her to be his SB.  If he is not happy with what he is getting, he will end it and she will not get paid.  So that is always going to be part of any SR.  \n\nMaybe he didn't realize exactly how it would feel being with her til they were naked together and he saw how she looked and also felt how she felt when intimate.  You never quite know how that will be until you get to that point.  And maybe he just would prefer she lose just a little weight to be his ideal.  Again, while I wouldn't want to have that conversation (It's a trap) I can see how some SDs might.  The primary thing they are paying for is a woman's beauty.  You can sugar coat it all you like, but it is the simple truth.  And over time that beauty tends to decay, both with age and, if someone isn't careful, with putting on weight.  Maybe she actually has put on a few pounds since they started.  \n\nThe simple fact is, if he prefers her to be slimmer to feel desire toward her, he is going to feel that whether he says anything about it or not.  Which is better?  He says nothing and just breaks it off, or he says something and gives her at least the option to do something about it or decide not to and she could even break it off?\n\nSRs can be very personal and that is when they are best, but at the end of the day, they are a business relationship.  You need to have a thick skin to handle business relationships in any context, but especially in the SR context.  Can't let emotions get in the way when you are talking about the business end of it.  For the men, that is the money.  For the women, that is the beauty and intimacy aspect.  \n\nStill, one shouldn't be insensitive either.  And really, I agree with you that it is better to just not start a SR with someone who doesn't meet your requirements than to start one and try to change them.",

I\u2019m guessing OP is lying about 140 lbs, too.  My girl did catfish a little with old pics, filters, and angles, and she was insecure about it.  She told me she doesn\u2019t take any negative comments well though.

He\u2019s direct and complains about something, she can do the same.  If he doesn\u2019t take it well, then she can bail.  It\u2019s pretty messed up to bail on someone with no discussion because your feelings are hurt, when literally the reason the person is paying money is because they have poorly developed social skills.

You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

People pursue the sugar lifestyle for lots of reasons.\n\nI would also like to clarify she didn't say she \"put on weight\" she just said she isn't quite as fit as she used to be. I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

There\u2019s really no other interpretation.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean everyone needs a 6 pack, my bad if it came across that way.  My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

I showed you an example of girls saying I\u2019m truly amazing for their mental health, and you respond by doubling down, replying three times in a row to my message, with more hate.  You can\u2019t think about it and reconsider?  Out of 100+ people, you were the nastiest.  Props to you for standing up for what you believe in, but maybe you should double check what you believe.

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.

Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok.

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

Even made a comment that was a bit racist, something along the lines of \u201cblack girls are so demanding, this girl asked me for 10k a month, I make that much\u201d He was such a stupid shithead, not a real sugar daddy at all. I won\u2019t bother you with the story but he traumatized me and made me feel devalued. I have an ED and don\u2019t even feel worthy of food at times",

I don't take ppl with me, bc I don't expect them to demand the same kind of physical workout out of theirselves, that I WILL push myself to do.\n\n2.

I\u2019ve coached them on what different machines are for and how to use them, but despite my years of experience working out and designing fitness training programs for guys (I went to a military school for that) I\u2019m not a personal fitness trainer and I\u2019m not current on the latest developments in physiology and fitness training, so I hired PFTs to work with the girls when I first got them memberships.  I enjoy spending time with them in the gym and seeing their gains, but probably the biggest benefit for them is that random guys don\u2019t try to hit on them while working out with me.\n\nI absolutely would want to go to the gym with you.

He's paying her to be his SB.  If he is not happy with what he is getting, he will end it and she will not get paid.  So that is always going to be part of any SR.  \n\nMaybe he didn't realize exactly how it would feel being with her til they were naked together and he saw how she looked and also felt how she felt when intimate.  You never quite know how that will be until you get to that point.  And maybe he just would prefer she lose just a little weight to be his ideal.  Again, while I wouldn't want to have that conversation (It's a trap) I can see how some SDs might.  The primary thing they are paying for is a woman's beauty.  You can sugar coat it all you like, but it is the simple truth.  And over time that beauty tends to decay, both with age and, if someone isn't careful, with putting on weight.  Maybe she actually has put on a few pounds since they started.  \n\nThe simple fact is, if he prefers her to be slimmer to feel desire toward her, he is going to feel that whether he says anything about it or not.  Which is better?  He says nothing and just breaks it off, or he says something and gives her at least the option to do something about it or decide not to and she could even break it off?\n\nSRs can be very personal and that is when they are best, but at the end of the day, they are a business relationship.  You need to have a thick skin to handle business relationships in any context, but especially in the SR context.  Can't let emotions get in the way when you are talking about the business end of it.  For the men, that is the money.  For the women, that is the beauty and intimacy aspect.  \n\nStill, one shouldn't be insensitive either.  And really, I agree with you that it is better to just not start a SR with someone who doesn't meet your requirements than to start one and try to change them.",

You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

That\u2019s problematic too, but it\u2019s within the bell curve of normal behavior.\n\nI\u2019d say she owes it to him to discuss if he\u2019s paying, because he is kinda paying for a practice girlfriend experience, so if he failed he should at least know why and how.  Everyone\u2019s jumping to this dumb conclusion of \u201cno he\u2019s evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot quite as fit\u201d definitely means she put on weight, though.  There\u2019s really no other interpretation.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean everyone needs a 6 pack, my bad if it came across that way.  My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

Though my face is so beautiful\ud83d\ude06and my body is good enough without working out that for me it's like ehh. I don't really neeed to. If anything I need to gain weight. That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

My workouts are brutal, and I've been told by more than just one person, that I have a growling resting bitch face, whenever I'm working out.\n\nWhich is probably actually true for 2 reasons\n1.  I go to the gym to get a damn WORKOUT, which is WHY I GO HARD.  I don't take ppl with me, bc I don't expect them to demand the same kind of physical workout out of theirselves, that I WILL push myself to do.\n\n2.  I'm NOT in the gym, for anyone else who is there, so my competition while I am there, IS ME.\nI've spent long enough physically training, to know where my heartbeat needs to stay, in order to be in the burning cals range.  \nI'm not in the gym to score someone or to have someone try and hit on me, I'm there to break a sweat and make my ass look irresistible.",

I can\u2019t carry 100 lb rucksacks up mountains like I used to, but I refuse to get fat.  The girls can\u2019t hang with me on pushing iron, but I\u2019ve never expected them to.  I\u2019ve coached them on what different machines are for and how to use them, but despite my years of experience working out and designing fitness training programs for guys (I went to a military school for that) I\u2019m not a personal fitness trainer and I\u2019m not current on the latest developments in physiology and fitness training, so I hired PFTs to work with the girls when I first got them memberships.  I enjoy spending time with them in the gym and seeing their gains, but probably the biggest benefit for them is that random guys don\u2019t try to hit on them while working out with me.\n\nI absolutely would want to go to the gym with you.  The endorphin rush would be nice, and working out with someone new always motivates me to push harder.",

He's paying her to be his SB.  If he is not happy with what he is getting, he will end it and she will not get paid.  So that is always going to be part of any SR.  \n\nMaybe he didn't realize exactly how it would feel being with her til they were naked together and he saw how she looked and also felt how she felt when intimate.  You never quite know how that will be until you get to that point.  And maybe he just would prefer she lose just a little weight to be his ideal.  Again, while I wouldn't want to have that conversation (It's a trap) I can see how some SDs might.  The primary thing they are paying for is a woman's beauty.  You can sugar coat it all you like, but it is the simple truth.  And over time that beauty tends to decay, both with age and, if someone isn't careful, with putting on weight.  Maybe she actually has put on a few pounds since they started.  \n\nThe simple fact is, if he prefers her to be slimmer to feel desire toward her, he is going to feel that whether he says anything about it or not.  Which is better?  He says nothing and just breaks it off, or he says something and gives her at least the option to do something about it or decide not to and she could even break it off?\n\nSRs can be very personal and that is when they are best, but at the end of the day, they are a business relationship.  You need to have a thick skin to handle business relationships in any context, but especially in the SR context.  Can't let emotions get in the way when you are talking about the business end of it.  For the men, that is the money.  For the women, that is the beauty and intimacy aspect.  \n\nStill, one shouldn't be insensitive either.  And really, I agree with you that it is better to just not start a SR with someone who doesn't meet your requirements than to start one and try to change them.",

I\u2019m guessing OP is lying about 140 lbs, too.  My girl did catfish a little with old pics, filters, and angles, and she was insecure about it.  She told me she doesn\u2019t take any negative comments well though.

You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

Everyone\u2019s jumping to this dumb conclusion of \u201cno he\u2019s evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot quite as fit\u201d definitely means she put on weight, though.

My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

She asked me for feedback on her body because she knows she could do better, and now she is, with a partner.

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok.

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

I spent 28 years jumping out of planes and shooting guns, and men were judged on their fitness and their ability to complete the mission.  I\u2019m busted up with injuries but I can still run 5 miles in 40 minutes and keep my heart rate over 160 for most of a 30 minute session on a rower.  I can\u2019t carry 100 lb rucksacks up mountains like I used to, but I refuse to get fat.  The girls can\u2019t hang with me on pushing iron, but I\u2019ve never expected them to.  I\u2019ve coached them on what different machines are for and how to use them, but despite my years of experience working out and designing fitness training programs for guys (I went to a military school for that) I\u2019m not a personal fitness trainer and I\u2019m not current on the latest developments in physiology and fitness training, so I hired PFTs to work with the girls when I first got them memberships.  I enjoy spending time with them in the gym and seeing their gains, but probably the biggest benefit for them is that random guys don\u2019t try to hit on them while working out with me.\n\nI absolutely would want to go to the gym with you.  The endorphin rush would be nice, and working out with someone new always motivates me to push harder.",

He's paying her to be his SB.  If he is not happy with what he is getting, he will end it and she will not get paid.  So that is always going to be part of any SR.  \n\nMaybe he didn't realize exactly how it would feel being with her til they were naked together and he saw how she looked and also felt how she felt when intimate.  You never quite know how that will be until you get to that point.  And maybe he just would prefer she lose just a little weight to be his ideal.  Again, while I wouldn't want to have that conversation (It's a trap) I can see how some SDs might.  The primary thing they are paying for is a woman's beauty.  You can sugar coat it all you like, but it is the simple truth.  And over time that beauty tends to decay, both with age and, if someone isn't careful, with putting on weight.  Maybe she actually has put on a few pounds since they started.  \n\nThe simple fact is, if he prefers her to be slimmer to feel desire toward her, he is going to feel that whether he says anything about it or not.  Which is better?  He says nothing and just breaks it off, or he says something and gives her at least the option to do something about it or decide not to and she could even break it off?\n\nSRs can be very personal and that is when they are best, but at the end of the day, they are a business relationship.  You need to have a thick skin to handle business relationships in any context, but especially in the SR context.  Can't let emotions get in the way when you are talking about the business end of it.  For the men, that is the money.  For the women, that is the beauty and intimacy aspect.  \n\nStill, one shouldn't be insensitive either.  And really, I agree with you that it is better to just not start a SR with someone who doesn't meet your requirements than to start one and try to change them.",

I can\u2019t even imagine that *during sex*, that\u2019s next level social problems if he didn\u2019t realize that would kill the mood.\n\nShe could talk to this guy directly about how he made her feel, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d get an apology, right?  He\u2019s direct and complains about something, she can do the same.  If he doesn\u2019t take it well, then she can bail.  It\u2019s pretty messed up to bail on someone with no discussion because your feelings are hurt, when literally the reason the person is paying money is because they have poorly developed social skills.  OP\u2019s got issues too if she can\u2019t talk to someone who offended her.

You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

People pursue the sugar lifestyle for lots of reasons.\n\nI would also like to clarify she didn't say she \"put on weight\" she just said she isn't quite as fit as she used to be. I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

That\u2019s problematic too, but it\u2019s within the bell curve of normal behavior.\n\nI\u2019d say she owes it to him to discuss if he\u2019s paying, because he is kinda paying for a practice girlfriend experience, so if he failed he should at least know why and how.  Everyone\u2019s jumping to this dumb conclusion of \u201cno he\u2019s evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot quite as fit\u201d definitely means she put on weight, though.  There\u2019s really no other interpretation.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean everyone needs a 6 pack, my bad if it came across that way.  My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

But like\u2026 OP should tell him that.  communication is a thing, use your words.  Ghosting culture is toxic.  If you care about other girls, you should *definitely* agree with me.  Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

Though my face is so beautiful\ud83d\ude06and my body is good enough without working out that for me it's like ehh. I don't really neeed to. If anything I need to gain weight. That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

He\u2019s direct and complains about something, she can do the same.  If he doesn\u2019t take it well, then she can bail.

You can\u2019t grab abs.  Even with a layer of fat, all you can do is pinch it.  Have you used body fat calipers on your stomach before?  By the time you can GRAB it, you\u2019ve got a roll of fat that looks unpleasant.  That might only add 2 pounds to the scale, and you can shave it off in 2 months.  If that offends you, then you\u2019re out of shape.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s 140 lbs.  but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.  It\u2019s so rare that someone doesn\u2019t round down their weight, and people don\u2019t weigh themselves regularly anyway unless they diet and work out, which OP indicated she doesn\u2019t.",

People pursue the sugar lifestyle for lots of reasons.\n\nI would also like to clarify she didn't say she \"put on weight\" she just said she isn't quite as fit as she used to be. I think +90% of people could turn around and pinpoint a time where they are \"more in shape\" than they are right now - does that automatically mean everyone who isn't at their \"peak fitness\" is flabby or overweight? \n\nIf you are saying that everyone who doesn't have a completely flat six-pack is flabby or needs to lose weight, I'm sorry, but you're out of touch with reality. \n\nFirst of all, many people would need to achieve an unusually (and often unhealthy) low body fat percentage to have the kind of visible, no-fat abs your advertising, especially women.\n\nAlso, ever seen a picture of a model sitting down (unedited)? We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

Everyone\u2019s jumping to this dumb conclusion of \u201cno he\u2019s evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot quite as fit\u201d definitely means she put on weight, though.

My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

It's very positive. People need to stand up for each other and help change this world. Including by speaking up to a guy who is mistreating the girl he's dating.",

Explain how that\u2019s so awful?\n\nProbably 100+ people read what I wrote, 20 downvoted, but you\u2014 you lashed out with insults you intended to be hurtful.  I showed you an example of girls saying I\u2019m truly amazing for their mental health, and you respond by doubling down, replying three times in a row to my message, with more hate.  You can\u2019t think about it and reconsider?  Out of 100+ people, you were the nastiest.  Props to you for standing up for what you believe in, but maybe you should double check what you believe.  And maybe you should show this exchange to your therapist and talk it over.  What does she think about what I wrote, and how you handled it?",

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

We've all got \"rolls\" at some point or another. \n\nFurthermore, plenty of people can have a flat stomach without having abs - again, you can google plenty of models who don't have \"abs\" per say, but have a flat stomach. \n\nAnd I can pretty much guarantee that if you took almost *anyone* on a date where they had something to eat and/or something to drink, then got them naked in bed, you could find \"something\" to grab.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether or not OP needs to lose weight (she doesn't) - the MAJOR point here is that **a man who is willing to grab onto your body and insult it during intimacy is hugely problematic**. \n\nI absolutely do not want to hear that it's \"lack of social skills\" because we'd be talking outliers WAY out of the bell curve if we're talking about someone who would not realize how disrespectful, demeaning, and rude that is.",

That\u2019s problematic too, but it\u2019s within the bell curve of normal behavior.\n\nI\u2019d say she owes it to him to discuss if he\u2019s paying, because he is kinda paying for a practice girlfriend experience, so if he failed he should at least know why and how.  Everyone\u2019s jumping to this dumb conclusion of \u201cno he\u2019s evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot quite as fit\u201d definitely means she put on weight, though.  There\u2019s really no other interpretation.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean everyone needs a 6 pack, my bad if it came across that way.  My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

She asked me for feedback on her body because she knows she could do better, and now she is, with a partner.  She also asked me to help her clean her place, so I did, she asked me to help her quit vaping, so I did, and she asked me to help her with her resume, so I did (now she\u2019s anxious about her interview tomorrow).\n\nGood luck with therapy.

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok.

As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

My point was you certainly can\u2019t grab abs, and when someone has just a quarter inch layer of fat (normal) that\u2019s not enough to grab either.  You need about a full inch thick layer of fat before you can grab it.  That might only be an extra pound or two.\n\n> if you took almost anyone on a date where they had something to eat, you could find something to grab\n\nNo you can\u2019t, that\u2019s completely wrong.  Are you saying you can grab through someone\u2019s abs and hold on to their stomach, or something?  OP has a layer of fat on her belly that\u2019s probably about 1\u201d thick, you really have to do mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.",

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

You should know way better in your generation not to talk to women like that.\n\nJust cause you're 36 doesn't mean you don't have eyebags or a double chin or messed up teeth.  \n\nMy therapy is going great. It's helped me learn even more about toxic people like you.\n\nYou have no idea what I even mean by whispers and petals.. it def has nothing to do with who I am.\n\nTelling a guy he shouldn't talk to a girl like thst is not negative. It's very positive. People need to stand up for each other and help change this world. Including by speaking up to a guy who is mistreating the girl he's dating.",

I did nothing wrong.  She asked me for reassurance on her body, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable giving it, so I didn\u2019t.  Now she wants to go to the gym with me and join my diet, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.  It was all her idea.  Explain how that\u2019s so awful?\n\nProbably 100+ people read what I wrote, 20 downvoted, but you\u2014 you lashed out with insults you intended to be hurtful.  I showed you an example of girls saying I\u2019m truly amazing for their mental health, and you respond by doubling down, replying three times in a row to my message, with more hate.  You can\u2019t think about it and reconsider?  Out of 100+ people, you were the nastiest.  Props to you for standing up for what you believe in, but maybe you should double check what you believe.  And maybe you should show this exchange to your therapist and talk it over.  What does she think about what I wrote, and how you handled it?",

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.

That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.

Though my face is so beautiful\ud83d\ude06and my body is good enough without working out that for me it's like ehh. I don't really neeed to. If anything I need to gain weight. That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

I did nothing wrong.  She asked me for reassurance on her body, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable giving it, so I didn\u2019t.  Now she wants to go to the gym with me and join my diet, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.  It was all her idea.  Explain how that\u2019s so awful?\n\nProbably 100+ people read what I wrote, 20 downvoted, but you\u2014 you lashed out with insults you intended to be hurtful.  I showed you an example of girls saying I\u2019m truly amazing for their mental health, and you respond by doubling down, replying three times in a row to my message, with more hate.  You can\u2019t think about it and reconsider?  Out of 100+ people, you were the nastiest.  Props to you for standing up for what you believe in, but maybe you should double check what you believe.  And maybe you should show this exchange to your therapist and talk it over.  What does she think about what I wrote, and how you handled it?",

I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok.

Just be careful though, you still need cardio for health especially as you age.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty funny about the guy just playing video games.  Normal hookup or SD?  I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.  I can\u2019t imagine he was *intentionally* a jerk, because why would he want to be mean to you?  Especially because that\u2019s a good way to not get laid again.  I\u2019m just imagining a space cadet video game addict.\n\nYou called me out on the phobia.  My entire family is obese.  As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

She asked me for feedback on her body because she knows she could do better, and now she is, with a partner.  She also asked me to help her clean her place, so I did, she asked me to help her quit vaping, so I did, and she asked me to help her with her resume, so I did (now she\u2019s anxious about her interview tomorrow).\n\nGood luck with therapy.

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",

I\u2019d guess he\u2019s oblivious, and just\u2026 didn\u2019t know what to do after an awkward silence, but he really wanted to play so he did hahaha.

As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.

He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.

It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.

I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.

Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.  I think we both care about the big picture but we\u2019re focusing on opposite sides.  You on controlling behavior, me on lack of discussion.  You on mental health, me on physical health.",

Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

As a kid I was told it\u2019s just genetic, it\u2019s not your fault, etc. which was people trying to be nice and avoid placing blame on me.  It just had the opposite effect, and made me hate who I was fundamentally, not realizing I could change.  It also made me think, as a kid, that the only chance for my kids to be skinny was if I got with a thin girl.  I hate the \u201clove yourself as you are\u201d mindset because it didn\u2019t work for me for a decade, but a 6 month diet flipped everything around.\n\nFortunately being a fat loser just meant I became an introverted nerd making cash.\n\nMy girl actually has a slight double chin.  She\u2019s still pretty and I tell her that, but if she slims up her face along with her stomach, she\u2019s gonna be damn *hot*.  She\u2019ll be happier with herself for it, I know it.  Myself, fortunately I have a sharp jaw line and conventionally attractive face.  My weakness is my fat goes straight to my tits.  I\u2019ve had two girls tell me I have bigger tits than them while grabbing them, so, it\u2019s not only guys who do shit like that lol.\n\nAnd sure, there are bigger problems out there.

I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins.

But like\u2026 OP should tell him that.  communication is a thing, use your words.  Ghosting culture is toxic.  If you care about other girls, you should *definitely* agree with me.  Because guess what the next girl is gonna have to deal with?  Probably the same damn thing, if nobody gave him feedback.  He\u2019s not gonna connect the dots and realize he was problematic.\n\nI do think her bringing him to the gym is a good idea, if she wants to.  I also think she should go to the gym and pay attention to her diet, because everyone should.  That goes double for models, actors and actresses, SB\u2019s, dancers, or anyone else who\u2019s job is based on physical appearance.\n\nI know girls (and guys) can have harmful anxiety about body image.  But we also have a harmful obesity epidemic.  The middle ground is to change what you can, and make peace with what you can\u2019t.  Diet, exercise, peace.  If you ignore any of those three, thats toxic.  I hate this trend of pushing self love while ignoring the rest of the picture, it\u2019s just like someone pushing self love while ignoring a resume.\n\nAs for questioning if I\u2019m lying\u2026 I could send you screenshots for proof but you didn\u2019t check the last ones, so I won\u2019t bother.",

That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok.

She asked me for feedback on her body because she knows she could do better, and now she is, with a partner.  She also asked me to help her clean her place, so I did, she asked me to help her quit vaping, so I did, and she asked me to help her with her resume, so I did (now she\u2019s anxious about her interview tomorrow).\n\nGood luck with therapy.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met some assholes, but if you\u2019re acting so aggressive and jumping to conclusions like this, you\u2019re part of the problem too.  But hey, who isn\u2019t sometimes",

If anything I need to gain weight. That still should be up to the girl in what SHE wants to look like though. When you're trying to change yourself for someone else it's never healthy.\n\nYea, you tend to forget guys can be that stupid though. Like the other day I hooked up with a guy I was dating and stopped talking to for a while. After hooking up he just picked up his game console and started playing video games. I'm like wtf? I don't know if he did that on purpose cause he doesn't want to catch feelings or what.. Like im cool with not being serious but ugh, I still want cuddles! \nSo... I dunno if to take that as him being oblivious or him just intentionally being a jerk.. \n\nI think you have some kind of phobia towards overweight people..  \n\nFor me it's double chins. I can't stand those in a partner. Will def not get with a guy who has one. Mild is ok. But I'm def not gonna tell a guy to work out or get that fixed.. \n\nI think we have bigger problems than overweight people that we shoulf be trying to fix/change.",
