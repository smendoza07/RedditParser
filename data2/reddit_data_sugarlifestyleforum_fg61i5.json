    "body": "So I\u2019m back with another post. My SD and I had our second date yesterday, let\u2019s just call him J for the sake of clarity. Well J picked me up from the train station and took us to the hotel he had booked. We showered and changed, lounged around a little and ordered room service. He tells me that he wants to take me out tonight, but he wants to pick me out an outfit. Well how could a girl say no to shopping? We went out, and after trying on half of three stores, he picks this beautiful, off the shoulder black dress, and a pair of pretty nude heels, (4inch to try and make up for our more than a foot height difference) stunning small gold hoops and a matching bracelet. After he took me to a salon to have my makeup done while he got a haircut. Minimal makeup and about 30 minutes later he comes back and picks me up with a bouquet of yellow roses (I told him they were my favorite and he remembered) we then went on our way to dinner, to an incredible restaurant, I\u2019ve never been anywhere that nice to eat. After that we went to a planetarium and just stared at the galaxy and each other for hours. It was so romantic, and he is the perfect gentleman. I could not have asked for a better time. But our night wasn\u2019t over! We went back to the hotel and had drinks in the bar, and talked and laughed for so long, I have never had such chemistry with anyone before, he really makes me feel so special. We retired to our room and spent the rest of the night in each other\u2019s arms, and our bodies fit together like puzzle pieces. I am so utterly comfortable being myself around him because I feel like he actually likes me for me. He\u2019s always giving me compliments and little smiles, and I catch him gazing at me sometimes. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting from a SD, but I could never have expected J. I feel so blessed.",
