I don\u2018t really understand how people can interpret it as a happy scene. At best she is torn as hell between the love for a father she barely knows, anxiety and her pain which is a hell of a lot of conflicting feelings to reconcile.\n\nThe whole Arc revolves around Sarada wanting to confront her father and get answers to quell the feelings of insecurity about who she really is. The prospect of being so close to meeting him brings back the feelings of abandonment caused by growing up with a father who is basically always on some mission far away and the feeling that nobody tells her the truth of what\u2018s going on.\n\nEspecially the scene in Orochimaru\u2018s hideout when she thinks that she found proof of Karin being her real mother shows very well how much pain is hiding in her and Naruto immediately realizes this when he sees her anger and that she has awakened her Sharingan. \n\nSo far every single Sharingan we saw was activated through some sort of trauma or extreme emotional distress and the clan culture of the Uchiha does a banger of a job to not promote any healthy coping mechanisms. The awakening of the sharingan is seen as a great step forward, is an object of envy in the clan and eagerly awaited by many. They basically celebrate getting traumatized. Every Uchiha that awakens or levels up their weaponized PTSD eyes should immediately get a referral to a bunch of therapy sessions.\n\nSeriously if your Uchiha friend gets their Sharingan you\u2018d better not congratulate them but rather give them a big, long hug. They\u2018ll probably need it.\n\nEDIT: also her second tomoe awakens when Boruto is about to be obliterated. The sharingan works as it always has with Sarada",

Yeah, I see no connection there lmao!! \n\nOne of the best twists from part 1 Naruto that I didn\u2019t see coming was that Itachi was a good guy. That wasn\u2019t obvious at all - but honestly fits really well with the story. Explains why Itachi only paralysed Kakashi, didn\u2019t want anything to do with Might Gai, and ran from Jiraiya.",

I think it was good writing regardless though. I like how these characters got mentioned early in Part 1, like when Kakashi visited his grave, and then we actually see these characters come into play hundreds of episodes down the line. \n\nJust for the record, I hadn\u2019t watched any Naruto before like 2013/2014, and I binge watched it all until I caught up with where we was in the war arc at the time - and that\u2019s how my friend was surprised when I guessed Minato was Naruto\u2019s dad and Tobi was Obito, he was literally stunned that I was sure it was them cause he had no idea when he was watching everything as it was being released.

I like how he was an angry soul turned more melancholy after his encounter with Naruto, but if he was going to die it should have been when they was going after Sasuke in Part 1. Not to a stick that he could have easily stopped with rotation. He definitely deserved a good fight in the war arc. Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

I don\u2018t really understand how people can interpret it as a happy scene. At best she is torn as hell between the love for a father she barely knows, anxiety and her pain which is a hell of a lot of conflicting feelings to reconcile.\n\nThe whole Arc revolves around Sarada wanting to confront her father and get answers to quell the feelings of insecurity about who she really is. The prospect of being so close to meeting him brings back the feelings of abandonment caused by growing up with a father who is basically always on some mission far away and the feeling that nobody tells her the truth of what\u2018s going on.\n\nEspecially the scene in Orochimaru\u2018s hideout when she thinks that she found proof of Karin being her real mother shows very well how much pain is hiding in her and Naruto immediately realizes this when he sees her anger and that she has awakened her Sharingan. \n\nSo far every single Sharingan we saw was activated through some sort of trauma or extreme emotional distress and the clan culture of the Uchiha does a banger of a job to not promote any healthy coping mechanisms. The awakening of the sharingan is seen as a great step forward, is an object of envy in the clan and eagerly awaited by many. They basically celebrate getting traumatized. Every Uchiha that awakens or levels up their weaponized PTSD eyes should immediately get a referral to a bunch of therapy sessions.\n\nSeriously if your Uchiha friend gets their Sharingan you\u2018d better not congratulate them but rather give them a big, long hug. They\u2018ll probably need it.\n\nEDIT: also her second tomoe awakens when Boruto is about to be obliterated. The sharingan works as it always has with Sarada",

Even if not earlier in the fight hiruzen surely couldve smoked oro at some earlier point. They let that fucker get away with too much. If you were caught experimenting on orphans and shit if i were hokage i wouldve sent everyone to kill you that the job needed lol. \n\nOrochimaru was a scary dude though. He brought so much dread early on. Remember when kakashi saw him early on and was frozen? Im not a naruto expert like so many here btw. Orochimaru was always one of my favorites tho lol. He was so damn creepy and his voice in the dub was perfect. The early episodes were like sakura, naruto and orochimaru fighting over who got sasuke lol. Naruto got him in the end though it seems.

I think it was good writing regardless though. I like how these characters got mentioned early in Part 1, like when Kakashi visited his grave, and then we actually see these characters come into play hundreds of episodes down the line. \n\nJust for the record, I hadn\u2019t watched any Naruto before like 2013/2014, and I binge watched it all until I caught up with where we was in the war arc at the time - and that\u2019s how my friend was surprised when I guessed Minato was Naruto\u2019s dad and Tobi was Obito, he was literally stunned that I was sure it was them cause he had no idea when he was watching everything as it was being released. I think that proves the good writing though, cause I\u2019m ass at catching stuff like that usually.",

I like how he was an angry soul turned more melancholy after his encounter with Naruto, but if he was going to die it should have been when they was going after Sasuke in Part 1. Not to a stick that he could have easily stopped with rotation. He definitely deserved a good fight in the war arc. Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

I don\u2018t really understand how people can interpret it as a happy scene. At best she is torn as hell between the love for a father she barely knows, anxiety and her pain which is a hell of a lot of conflicting feelings to reconcile.\n\nThe whole Arc revolves around Sarada wanting to confront her father and get answers to quell the feelings of insecurity about who she really is. The prospect of being so close to meeting him brings back the feelings of abandonment caused by growing up with a father who is basically always on some mission far away and the feeling that nobody tells her the truth of what\u2018s going on.\n\nEspecially the scene in Orochimaru\u2018s hideout when she thinks that she found proof of Karin being her real mother shows very well how much pain is hiding in her and Naruto immediately realizes this when he sees her anger and that she has awakened her Sharingan. \n\nSo far every single Sharingan we saw was activated through some sort of trauma or extreme emotional distress and the clan culture of the Uchiha does a banger of a job to not promote any healthy coping mechanisms. The awakening of the sharingan is seen as a great step forward, is an object of envy in the clan and eagerly awaited by many. They basically celebrate getting traumatized. Every Uchiha that awakens or levels up their weaponized PTSD eyes should immediately get a referral to a bunch of therapy sessions.\n\nSeriously if your Uchiha friend gets their Sharingan you\u2018d better not congratulate them but rather give them a big, long hug. They\u2018ll probably need it.\n\nEDIT: also her second tomoe awakens when Boruto is about to be obliterated. The sharingan works as it always has with Sarada",

He brought so much dread early on. Remember when kakashi saw him early on and was frozen? Im not a naruto expert like so many here btw. Orochimaru was always one of my favorites tho lol.

I think it was good writing regardless though. I like how these characters got mentioned early in Part 1, like when Kakashi visited his grave, and then we actually see these characters come into play hundreds of episodes down the line. \n\nJust for the record, I hadn\u2019t watched any Naruto before like 2013/2014, and I binge watched it all until I caught up with where we was in the war arc at the time - and that\u2019s how my friend was surprised when I guessed Minato was Naruto\u2019s dad and Tobi was Obito, he was literally stunned that I was sure it was them cause he had no idea when he was watching everything as it was being released. I think that proves the good writing though, cause I\u2019m ass at catching stuff like that usually.",

I like how he was an angry soul turned more melancholy after his encounter with Naruto, but if he was going to die it should have been when they was going after Sasuke in Part 1. Not to a stick that he could have easily stopped with rotation. He definitely deserved a good fight in the war arc. Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

I don\u2018t really understand how people can interpret it as a happy scene. At best she is torn as hell between the love for a father she barely knows, anxiety and her pain which is a hell of a lot of conflicting feelings to reconcile.\n\nThe whole Arc revolves around Sarada wanting to confront her father and get answers to quell the feelings of insecurity about who she really is. The prospect of being so close to meeting him brings back the feelings of abandonment caused by growing up with a father who is basically always on some mission far away and the feeling that nobody tells her the truth of what\u2018s going on.\n\nEspecially the scene in Orochimaru\u2018s hideout when she thinks that she found proof of Karin being her real mother shows very well how much pain is hiding in her and Naruto immediately realizes this when he sees her anger and that she has awakened her Sharingan. \n\nSo far every single Sharingan we saw was activated through some sort of trauma or extreme emotional distress and the clan culture of the Uchiha does a banger of a job to not promote any healthy coping mechanisms. The awakening of the sharingan is seen as a great step forward, is an object of envy in the clan and eagerly awaited by many. They basically celebrate getting traumatized. Every Uchiha that awakens or levels up their weaponized PTSD eyes should immediately get a referral to a bunch of therapy sessions.\n\nSeriously if your Uchiha friend gets their Sharingan you\u2018d better not congratulate them but rather give them a big, long hug. They\u2018ll probably need it.\n\nEDIT: also her second tomoe awakens when Boruto is about to be obliterated. The sharingan works as it always has with Sarada",

I think it was good writing regardless though. I like how these characters got mentioned early in Part 1, like when Kakashi visited his grave, and then we actually see these characters come into play hundreds of episodes down the line. \n\nJust for the record, I hadn\u2019t watched any Naruto before like 2013/2014, and I binge watched it all until I caught up with where we was in the war arc at the time - and that\u2019s how my friend was surprised when I guessed Minato was Naruto\u2019s dad and Tobi was Obito, he was literally stunned that I was sure it was them cause he had no idea when he was watching everything as it was being released.

Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

I don\u2018t really understand how people can interpret it as a happy scene. At best she is torn as hell between the love for a father she barely knows, anxiety and her pain which is a hell of a lot of conflicting feelings to reconcile.\n\nThe whole Arc revolves around Sarada wanting to confront her father and get answers to quell the feelings of insecurity about who she really is. The prospect of being so close to meeting him brings back the feelings of abandonment caused by growing up with a father who is basically always on some mission far away and the feeling that nobody tells her the truth of what\u2018s going on.\n\nEspecially the scene in Orochimaru\u2018s hideout when she thinks that she found proof of Karin being her real mother shows very well how much pain is hiding in her and Naruto immediately realizes this when he sees her anger and that she has awakened her Sharingan. \n\nSo far every single Sharingan we saw was activated through some sort of trauma or extreme emotional distress and the clan culture of the Uchiha does a banger of a job to not promote any healthy coping mechanisms. The awakening of the sharingan is seen as a great step forward, is an object of envy in the clan and eagerly awaited by many. They basically celebrate getting traumatized. Every Uchiha that awakens or levels up their weaponized PTSD eyes should immediately get a referral to a bunch of therapy sessions.\n\nSeriously if your Uchiha friend gets their Sharingan you\u2018d better not congratulate them but rather give them a big, long hug. They\u2018ll probably need it.\n\nEDIT: also her second tomoe awakens when Boruto is about to be obliterated. The sharingan works as it always has with Sarada",

Weird ass fool stealing eyeballs and undermining my authority, fuck that. I probably would've let orochimaru just be exiled tho bc that weird bastard has style for days. So what he kills some orphans and what not, gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet. I don't get why Kakashi was so scared of oro in og naruto he fuckin froze like a little rabbit though. I mean yea he's creepy and can fight but Kakashi was no slouch. I also loved every interaction between orochimaru and itachi. I'm not a complete itachi simp bc I think he handled things all wrong, traumatizing your little brother and insisting he fill himself with all the hate possible isn't good, but itachi  just had so much class and no one knew what he was capable of.",

If you were caught experimenting on orphans and shit if i were hokage i wouldve sent everyone to kill you that the job needed lol. \n\nOrochimaru was a scary dude though. He brought so much dread early on. Remember when kakashi saw him early on and was frozen? Im not a naruto expert like so many here btw. Orochimaru was always one of my favorites tho lol. He was so damn creepy and his voice in the dub was perfect. The early episodes were like sakura, naruto and orochimaru fighting over who got sasuke lol. Naruto got him in the end though it seems.

I think it was good writing regardless though. I like how these characters got mentioned early in Part 1, like when Kakashi visited his grave, and then we actually see these characters come into play hundreds of episodes down the line. \n\nJust for the record, I hadn\u2019t watched any Naruto before like 2013/2014, and I binge watched it all until I caught up with where we was in the war arc at the time - and that\u2019s how my friend was surprised when I guessed Minato was Naruto\u2019s dad and Tobi was Obito, he was literally stunned that I was sure it was them cause he had no idea when he was watching everything as it was being released.

Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy.

At best she is torn as hell between the love for a father she barely knows, anxiety and her pain which is a hell of a lot of conflicting feelings to reconcile.\n\nThe whole Arc revolves around Sarada wanting to confront her father and get answers to quell the feelings of insecurity about who she really is. The prospect of being so close to meeting him brings back the feelings of abandonment caused by growing up with a father who is basically always on some mission far away and the feeling that nobody tells her the truth of what\u2018s going on.\n\nEspecially the scene in Orochimaru\u2018s hideout when she thinks that she found proof of Karin being her real mother shows very well how much pain is hiding in her and Naruto immediately realizes this when he sees her anger and that she has awakened her Sharingan. \n\nSo far every single Sharingan we saw was activated through some sort of trauma or extreme emotional distress and the clan culture of the Uchiha does a banger of a job to not promote any healthy coping mechanisms. The awakening of the sharingan is seen as a great step forward, is an object of envy in the clan and eagerly awaited by many. They basically celebrate getting traumatized. Every Uchiha that awakens or levels up their weaponized PTSD eyes should immediately get a referral to a bunch of therapy sessions.\n\nSeriously if your Uchiha friend gets their Sharingan you\u2018d better not congratulate them but rather give them a big, long hug. They\u2018ll probably need it.\n\nEDIT: also her second tomoe awakens when Boruto is about to be obliterated. The sharingan works as it always has with Sarada",

I like how he was an angry soul turned more melancholy after his encounter with Naruto, but if he was going to die it should have been when they was going after Sasuke in Part 1. Not to a stick that he could have easily stopped with rotation. He definitely deserved a good fight in the war arc. Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy.

Even if not earlier in the fight hiruzen surely couldve smoked oro at some earlier point. They let that fucker get away with too much. If you were caught experimenting on orphans and shit if i were hokage i wouldve sent everyone to kill you that the job needed lol. \n\nOrochimaru was a scary dude though. He brought so much dread early on. Remember when kakashi saw him early on and was frozen? Im not a naruto expert like so many here btw. Orochimaru was always one of my favorites tho lol. He was so damn creepy and his voice in the dub was perfect. The early episodes were like sakura, naruto and orochimaru fighting over who got sasuke lol. Naruto got him in the end though it seems. I havent seen boruto tho.",

Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy.

I don't get why Kakashi was so scared of oro in og naruto he fuckin froze like a little rabbit though. I mean yea he's creepy and can fight but Kakashi was no slouch. I also loved every interaction between orochimaru and itachi. I'm not a complete itachi simp bc I think he handled things all wrong, traumatizing your little brother and insisting he fill himself with all the hate possible isn't good, but itachi  just had so much class and no one knew what he was capable of.",

He brought so much dread early on. Remember when kakashi saw him early on and was frozen? Im not a naruto expert like so many here btw. Orochimaru was always one of my favorites tho lol. He was so damn creepy and his voice in the dub was perfect. The early episodes were like sakura, naruto and orochimaru fighting over who got sasuke lol. Naruto got him in the end though it seems.

Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy.

I wished Neji got a badass one on one fight in Shippuden but unfortunately Kishimoto didnt give us that.",

I like how he was an angry soul turned more melancholy after his encounter with Naruto, but if he was going to die it should have been when they was going after Sasuke in Part 1. Not to a stick that he could have easily stopped with rotation. He definitely deserved a good fight in the war arc. Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

            "body": "Yeah 64 palms was just super sick. I like how he was an angry soul turned more melancholy after his encounter with Naruto, but if he was going to die it should have been when they was going after Sasuke in Part 1. Not to a stick that he could have easily stopped with rotation. He definitely deserved a good fight in the war arc. Naruto was always my favourite character, but I didn\u2019t want him to become unbearably OP against everyone. I feel like after Pain we should have got some focus on the rest of the cast. Rock lee with 7 gates would have been legendary. Ten Ten with the OP weapons like the Totsuka blades, yamanaka beads, and uchiha fan. Sakura with a speed buff or something. Ino with some genjutsu maybe. Etc. Shikamaru was the only one with some considerable battle improvements, mainly due to his IQ growing like crazy. Shikamaru is really impressive as a ninja with no great physical abilities.",

I probably would've let orochimaru just be exiled tho bc that weird bastard has style for days. So what he kills some orphans and what not, gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet. I don't get why Kakashi was so scared of oro in og naruto he fuckin froze like a little rabbit though. I mean yea he's creepy and can fight but Kakashi was no slouch. I also loved every interaction between orochimaru and itachi. I'm not a complete itachi simp bc I think he handled things all wrong, traumatizing your little brother and insisting he fill himself with all the hate possible isn't good, but itachi  just had so much class and no one knew what he was capable of.",

If you were caught experimenting on orphans and shit if i were hokage i wouldve sent everyone to kill you that the job needed lol. \n\nOrochimaru was a scary dude though. He brought so much dread early on. Remember when kakashi saw him early on and was frozen? Im not a naruto expert like so many here btw. Orochimaru was always one of my favorites tho lol. He was so damn creepy and his voice in the dub was perfect. The early episodes were like sakura, naruto and orochimaru fighting over who got sasuke lol. Naruto got him in the end though it seems.
