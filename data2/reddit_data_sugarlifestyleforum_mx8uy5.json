    "body": "Story time: Last night I met up with a POT for a second date. Admittedly, I was skeptical after the first date, but I said fuck it, I\u2019ll give this guy another shot. Long story short, one thing led to another &amp; we hooked up. I told him what I liked (e.g., being choked) &amp; he knew what to do, so I was thoroughly enjoying myself... Until suddenly, to my horror, he struck me in the face, which I DID NOT consent to. Before I could even react, he finished &amp; told me he loved me as he was lying on top of me. \ud83d\ude33 I got the fuck up out of there real quick. He then proceeded to call me 15 times on my way home. I wish I were making this shit up.",

While his actioms were all kinds of wrong you probably wouldn't do well in court. \n\nFirst the fact you asked him to choke you, he can use that to make the claim that he thought you wanted more rough stuff. Whether anyone agrees he's right or wrong, it is at least a reasonable claim, especially since you said he only did it once and you didn't correct him. \n\nSecond, stealthing (SADLY) is often not illegal and it is impossible to prove unless you have a video tape. He xan always claim you agreed to it. \n\nLastly, it would be very easy for him to pin you as a prostitute.\n\nI want you to know, I'm not trying to blame you or make you feel in any way like this wasn't a big deal. He was fucked up in numerous ways, and you were done several wrongs. I'm sorry for you. \nBut all thses people saying to call the cops...do whatever helps you feel better but I'm just warning you a head of time, there will probably be little to nothing done.",

Whether anyone agrees he's right or wrong, it is at least a reasonable claim, especially since you said he only did it once and you didn't correct him. \n\nSecond, stealthing (SADLY) is often not illegal and it is impossible to prove unless you have a video tape. He xan always claim you agreed to it. \n\nLastly, it would be very easy for him to pin you as a prostitute.\n\nI want you to know, I'm not trying to blame you or make you feel in any way like this wasn't a big deal.

While his actioms were all kinds of wrong you probably wouldn't do well in court. \n\nFirst the fact you asked him to choke you, he can use that to make the claim that he thought you wanted more rough stuff. Whether anyone agrees he's right or wrong, it is at least a reasonable claim, especially since you said he only did it once and you didn't correct him. \n\nSecond, stealthing (SADLY) is often not illegal and it is impossible to prove unless you have a video tape. He xan always claim you agreed to it. \n\nLastly, it would be very easy for him to pin you as a prostitute.\n\nI want you to know, I'm not trying to blame you or make you feel in any way like this wasn't a big deal. He was fucked up in numerous ways, and you were done several wrongs. I'm sorry for you. \nBut all thses people saying to call the cops...do whatever helps you feel better but I'm just warning you a head of time, there will probably be little to nothing done.",

While his actioms were all kinds of wrong you probably wouldn't do well in court. \n\nFirst the fact you asked him to choke you, he can use that to make the claim that he thought you wanted more rough stuff. Whether anyone agrees he's right or wrong, it is at least a reasonable claim, especially since you said he only did it once and you didn't correct him. \n\nSecond, stealthing (SADLY) is often not illegal and it is impossible to prove unless you have a video tape. He xan always claim you agreed to it. \n\nLastly, it would be very easy for him to pin you as a prostitute.\n\nI want you to know, I'm not trying to blame you or make you feel in any way like this wasn't a big deal. He was fucked up in numerous ways, and you were done several wrongs. I'm sorry for you. \nBut all thses people saying to call the cops...do whatever helps you feel better but I'm just warning you a head of time, there will probably be little to nothing done.",
