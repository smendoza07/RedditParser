My chin isn\u2019t quite as strong as yours but I have the jawline and cheekbones. \nHow long is your hair in the last two pics, is it the same length all around? I could potentially look like this but my hair grows  more like Bob Dylan than Mathew McConaughey. Any styling/haircut guidance? Its almost 4 inches on top rn but coarser and wavier than yours.\nThanks bro.",
