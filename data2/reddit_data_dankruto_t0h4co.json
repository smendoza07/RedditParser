The reason why it's so hard to get close to him is because physical attacks are the only thing that could really hurt him, and most long ranged physical attacks are visible. Guy can throw a punch in 7th gate form Meters away and still make contact with pain. And with that type of force I don't think almighty push could defend it. Guy also is really good at breaking down his opponents and what they are capable of. I do think he would need 7 gates, I do not think he would need the 8th gate though. It would be cool if some one could animate this though haha",

It seemed bad, sure, but nothing like a full blown war where Kage and Elite Shinobi die.\n\nI mean there were more major deaths in Tobirama\u2019s last battle.\n\nPut it this way, Guy only went 8th gate when he was one of the last fighters in the most important end of the world battle AND EVEN THEN he only went 8th gate when his Taijutsu was the only thing that could work.\n\nOrochimaru was bad and everything but on the scale of things it was pretty small fries, but it wasn\u2019t like everything was screwed if Guy didn\u2019t go 8 gates. He could fight any of the invaders without 8 gates. Who would he need to go 8 gates for. It\u2019s not like the village was going to get destroyed or anything. There was just some damage. \n\nEven if Orochimaru didn\u2019t get injured vs Hirizun he would have to fight Jirya, Guy and Kakashi.\n\nKonahono would have been better off with him just saving his power for the next war or something. As bad as Orochimaru is, he never came close to destroying the village.",

They were high for that point in the series, sure. But nowhere near as high as the 9 tails attack or a real war. The Hokage did die, just like Minato and Tobirama. I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",

The reason why it's so hard to get close to him is because physical attacks are the only thing that could really hurt him, and most long ranged physical attacks are visible. Guy can throw a punch in 7th gate form Meters away and still make contact with pain. And with that type of force I don't think almighty push could defend it. Guy also is really good at breaking down his opponents and what they are capable of. I do think he would need 7 gates, I do not think he would need the 8th gate though.

He could fight any of the invaders without 8 gates. Who would he need to go 8 gates for. It\u2019s not like the village was going to get destroyed or anything.

I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",

The reason why it's so hard to get close to him is because physical attacks are the only thing that could really hurt him, and most long ranged physical attacks are visible. Guy can throw a punch in 7th gate form Meters away and still make contact with pain. And with that type of force I don't think almighty push could defend it. Guy also is really good at breaking down his opponents and what they are capable of. I do think he would need 7 gates, I do not think he would need the 8th gate though. It would be cool if some one could animate this though haha",

It seemed bad, sure, but nothing like a full blown war where Kage and Elite Shinobi die.\n\nI mean there were more major deaths in Tobirama\u2019s last battle.\n\nPut it this way, Guy only went 8th gate when he was one of the last fighters in the most important end of the world battle AND EVEN THEN he only went 8th gate when his Taijutsu was the only thing that could work.\n\nOrochimaru was bad and everything but on the scale of things it was pretty small fries, but it wasn\u2019t like everything was screwed if Guy didn\u2019t go 8 gates. He could fight any of the invaders without 8 gates. Who would he need to go 8 gates for. It\u2019s not like the village was going to get destroyed or anything. There was just some damage. \n\nEven if Orochimaru didn\u2019t get injured vs Hirizun he would have to fight Jirya, Guy and Kakashi.\n\nKonahono would have been better off with him just saving his power for the next war or something. As bad as Orochimaru is, he never came close to destroying the village.",

They were high for that point in the series, sure. But nowhere near as high as the 9 tails attack or a real war. The Hokage did die, just like Minato and Tobirama. I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",

The reason why it's so hard to get close to him is because physical attacks are the only thing that could really hurt him, and most long ranged physical attacks are visible. Guy can throw a punch in 7th gate form Meters away and still make contact with pain. And with that type of force I don't think almighty push could defend it. Guy also is really good at breaking down his opponents and what they are capable of. I do think he would need 7 gates, I do not think he would need the 8th gate though. It would be cool if some one could animate this though haha",

He could fight any of the invaders without 8 gates. Who would he need to go 8 gates for. It\u2019s not like the village was going to get destroyed or anything. There was just some damage. \n\nEven if Orochimaru didn\u2019t get injured vs Hirizun he would have to fight Jirya, Guy and Kakashi.\n\nKonahono would have been better off with him just saving his power for the next war or something.

They were high for that point in the series, sure. But nowhere near as high as the 9 tails attack or a real war. The Hokage did die, just like Minato and Tobirama. I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",

The reason why it's so hard to get close to him is because physical attacks are the only thing that could really hurt him, and most long ranged physical attacks are visible. Guy can throw a punch in 7th gate form Meters away and still make contact with pain. And with that type of force I don't think almighty push could defend it. Guy also is really good at breaking down his opponents and what they are capable of. I do think he would need 7 gates, I do not think he would need the 8th gate though.

I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",

I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",

But nowhere near as high as the 9 tails attack or a real war. The Hokage did die, just like Minato and Tobirama. I mean most of the Kage we know of died in war.\n\nIt would be bad tactics to use the villages absolute ace on something so small. Imagine something serious happened, the kind of thing that might actually hurt the village as much as a war or the 9 tails attack.\n\nI mean, Orchimaru was at best the 4th most threatening attack in Orochimarus life. The 9 tails was more dangerous, Pein was Legit, and the 4th war was an end of the world situation that united every village.\n\nI mean Orochimarus attack was bad and everything but was pretty regular for Ninja history. Pein legit destroyed the village. The fourth war took 7 tailed beasts, resurrected many many ninja who were each stronger than Orochimaru, turned Madara into a god, temporary killed the next two strongest ninja. Ya, basically captured every ninja and every living Kage long before Guy even mentioned opening the 8th gate.\n\nImagine Guy opened the 8th gate for Orochimaru and a serious war, the kind were lots of S class ninja die happens. He would look silly. There were more s class ninja in Tobiramas last battle than there were in the entire Orochimaru arc.\n\nYes, the Hokage got killed, like most Hokage. But in context and compared to actual wars it was pretty small.\n\nIn that point in the story, where we don\u2019t know anything about the wars, and Orochimaru looks like the scariest guy out there it seems like a massive deal.",
