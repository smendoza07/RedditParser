With your shorter hair it looks like they rounded you off a little to tight where the sides meet the top. A more square shape would compliment your facial structure better; as it does most men. Not a big deal though, still looks good and that'll grow in within a couple weeks, just maybe mention that next time. (I'm a barber)",
