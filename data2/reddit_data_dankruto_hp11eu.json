And yeah he could probably beat most of the previous hokage easily we are talking about ninja president not ninja general especially seeing that the world is taking a more peaceful turn.  Naruto is hands down the best diplomat in the entirety of naruto but winning hearts dose not mean you can lead a nation effectively.",

I find it implausible for crime to exist in a world where you\u2019re met with almost immediate retribution from a force so unstoppable that he could destroy the entire nation you\u2019re in within minutes. The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem. Now you are the savior who prevented some disaster versus the vigilante terrorist who acts without govt consent and without regards to int borders.",

They\u2019d take any action as a form of aggression in sure (although there\u2019s nothing they could do to stop it) On the reread I agree with you, I think there\u2019s a balance between what I said and what Naruto is currently doing. Be better if he had government consent from the other kages- which wouldn\u2019t be difficult considering the positive relationships Naruto has cultivated. He could do it like US bases if other nations consented- station a Naruto clone in/near allied nations. They did in the real world so I don\u2019t see why not in the Shinobi world. It may build resentment amongst other nations you\u2019re right; this is an issue in the real world as well. There\u2019s no real solution in a world where power distribution is so unequal and it\u2019s so easy to oppress your fellow man.",

Where is danzo with MKGA hat, sounds like his ultimate plan in all honesty. Create the most powerful entity and ensure his loyalty to the village by making him idolize ruling it. Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat. Now he has the hat, But really, the hat, and konoha, controls him.",

If she isn't smarter than him then she is VERY close to him. \n\n>But what I meant is Jiraiya had background knowledge of Nagato. Knowledge Tsunade would not have. Tsunade only met Nagato once, in passing.\n\nThe only knowledge that Jiraiya had was that Nagato possessed the Rinnegan and used a variety of ninjutsu. But that would be immediately obvious to Tsunade as well since she could see his eyes in the tendo pain. In fact I'd even say that Jiraiya knowing Nagato only led to more confusion as he was expecting a fighting style and behaviour completely different that what he actually saw, which threw him off. \n\n>I would argue that Jiraiya is the second smartest in terms of fighting experience and strategy, but I don't think I can convince you of that and I don't feel like trying right now. \n\nI disagree but fair enough. \n\n>Orochimaru is the smartest of the group and even he wouldn't figure out Pain without background knowledge.\n\nThe thing is Jiraiya's knowledge advantage was infinitesimal at best and imo doesn't compensate for Tsunade or Orochimaru's keen analytical eyes and sharp mind.",

The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

He wouldn't be accountable to anyone and would draw the ire of leaders who believe he is saying with his actions that your country can't handle problems, you are to weak or dumb or etc. This action would most likely start world war 4. Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem. Now you are the savior who prevented some disaster versus the vigilante terrorist who acts without govt consent and without regards to int borders.",

Be better if he had government consent from the other kages- which wouldn\u2019t be difficult considering the positive relationships Naruto has cultivated. He could do it like US bases if other nations consented- station a Naruto clone in/near allied nations. They did in the real world so I don\u2019t see why not in the Shinobi world. It may build resentment amongst other nations you\u2019re right; this is an issue in the real world as well.

Where is danzo with MKGA hat, sounds like his ultimate plan in all honesty. Create the most powerful entity and ensure his loyalty to the village by making him idolize ruling it. Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat.

Tsunade only met Nagato once, in passing.\n\nThe only knowledge that Jiraiya had was that Nagato possessed the Rinnegan and used a variety of ninjutsu. But that would be immediately obvious to Tsunade as well since she could see his eyes in the tendo pain. In fact I'd even say that Jiraiya knowing Nagato only led to more confusion as he was expecting a fighting style and behaviour completely different that what he actually saw, which threw him off. \n\n>I would argue that Jiraiya is the second smartest in terms of fighting experience and strategy, but I don't think I can convince you of that and I don't feel like trying right now. \n\nI disagree but fair enough. \n\n>Orochimaru is the smartest of the group and even he wouldn't figure out Pain without background knowledge.\n\nThe thing is Jiraiya's knowledge advantage was infinitesimal at best and imo doesn't compensate for Tsunade or Orochimaru's keen analytical eyes and sharp mind.",

The loin is where the \"ny strip\" comes from but isn't in the rib section where you'll get the ribeye cap. The cap on this steak has been removed along with the excess fat because it's not needed, it's a well marbled piece of prime beef. Some butchers trim steaks more than others, costco usually breaks down their prime ribeyes into ribeye filets(the main muscle) and ribeye caps steaks. You don't waste money on hunks of fat it's all meat",

I find it implausible for crime to exist in a world where you\u2019re met with almost immediate retribution from a force so unstoppable that he could destroy the entire nation you\u2019re in within minutes. The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem.

They\u2019d take any action as a form of aggression in sure (although there\u2019s nothing they could do to stop it) On the reread I agree with you, I think there\u2019s a balance between what I said and what Naruto is currently doing. Be better if he had government consent from the other kages- which wouldn\u2019t be difficult considering the positive relationships Naruto has cultivated. He could do it like US bases if other nations consented- station a Naruto clone in/near allied nations. They did in the real world so I don\u2019t see why not in the Shinobi world. It may build resentment amongst other nations you\u2019re right; this is an issue in the real world as well. There\u2019s no real solution in a world where power distribution is so unequal and it\u2019s so easy to oppress your fellow man.",

Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat.

In fact I'd even say that Jiraiya knowing Nagato only led to more confusion as he was expecting a fighting style and behaviour completely different that what he actually saw, which threw him off. \n\n>I would argue that Jiraiya is the second smartest in terms of fighting experience and strategy, but I don't think I can convince you of that and I don't feel like trying right now. \n\nI disagree but fair enough. \n\n>Orochimaru is the smartest of the group and even he wouldn't figure out Pain without background knowledge.\n\nThe thing is Jiraiya's knowledge advantage was infinitesimal at best and imo doesn't compensate for Tsunade or Orochimaru's keen analytical eyes and sharp mind.",

Some butchers trim steaks more than others, costco usually breaks down their prime ribeyes into ribeye filets(the main muscle) and ribeye caps steaks.

Now I will say she did rise to the occasion during the Kage summit and even more so during the actual war, but I will point back to my comment on naruto how during a peace time situation her negotiation skills and battlefield tactics will only help her so much.",

I find it implausible for crime to exist in a world where you\u2019re met with almost immediate retribution from a force so unstoppable that he could destroy the entire nation you\u2019re in within minutes. The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem.

Be better if he had government consent from the other kages- which wouldn\u2019t be difficult considering the positive relationships Naruto has cultivated. He could do it like US bases if other nations consented- station a Naruto clone in/near allied nations. They did in the real world so I don\u2019t see why not in the Shinobi world.

If she isn't smarter than him then she is VERY close to him. \n\n>But what I meant is Jiraiya had background knowledge of Nagato. Knowledge Tsunade would not have. Tsunade only met Nagato once, in passing.\n\nThe only knowledge that Jiraiya had was that Nagato possessed the Rinnegan and used a variety of ninjutsu. But that would be immediately obvious to Tsunade as well since she could see his eyes in the tendo pain. In fact I'd even say that Jiraiya knowing Nagato only led to more confusion as he was expecting a fighting style and behaviour completely different that what he actually saw, which threw him off. \n\n>I would argue that Jiraiya is the second smartest in terms of fighting experience and strategy, but I don't think I can convince you of that and I don't feel like trying right now. \n\nI disagree but fair enough. \n\n>Orochimaru is the smartest of the group and even he wouldn't figure out Pain without background knowledge.\n\nThe thing is Jiraiya's knowledge advantage was infinitesimal at best and imo doesn't compensate for Tsunade or Orochimaru's keen analytical eyes and sharp mind.",

I find it implausible for crime to exist in a world where you\u2019re met with almost immediate retribution from a force so unstoppable that he could destroy the entire nation you\u2019re in within minutes. The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

All\n or most other nations prolly respect Naruto but would rather him not meddle in their own countries affairs. He wouldn't be accountable to anyone and would draw the ire of leaders who believe he is saying with his actions that your country can't handle problems, you are to weak or dumb or etc. This action would most likely start world war 4. Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem. Now you are the savior who prevented some disaster versus the vigilante terrorist who acts without govt consent and without regards to int borders.",

They\u2019d take any action as a form of aggression in sure (although there\u2019s nothing they could do to stop it) On the reread I agree with you, I think there\u2019s a balance between what I said and what Naruto is currently doing. Be better if he had government consent from the other kages- which wouldn\u2019t be difficult considering the positive relationships Naruto has cultivated. He could do it like US bases if other nations consented- station a Naruto clone in/near allied nations. They did in the real world so I don\u2019t see why not in the Shinobi world. It may build resentment amongst other nations you\u2019re right; this is an issue in the real world as well.

Where is danzo with MKGA hat, sounds like his ultimate plan in all honesty. Create the most powerful entity and ensure his loyalty to the village by making him idolize ruling it. Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat.

Tsunade only met Nagato once, in passing.\n\nThe only knowledge that Jiraiya had was that Nagato possessed the Rinnegan and used a variety of ninjutsu. But that would be immediately obvious to Tsunade as well since she could see his eyes in the tendo pain. In fact I'd even say that Jiraiya knowing Nagato only led to more confusion as he was expecting a fighting style and behaviour completely different that what he actually saw, which threw him off. \n\n>I would argue that Jiraiya is the second smartest in terms of fighting experience and strategy, but I don't think I can convince you of that and I don't feel like trying right now. \n\nI disagree but fair enough. \n\n>Orochimaru is the smartest of the group and even he wouldn't figure out Pain without background knowledge.\n\nThe thing is Jiraiya's knowledge advantage was infinitesimal at best and imo doesn't compensate for Tsunade or Orochimaru's keen analytical eyes and sharp mind.",

I find it implausible for crime to exist in a world where you\u2019re met with almost immediate retribution from a force so unstoppable that he could destroy the entire nation you\u2019re in within minutes. The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem.

Still it's funny that is the result of jiraya and everyone wanting peace but having to stop pain. In this case Naruto is little more than a pawn to defeat pain and restore konoha to greatness. Where is danzo with MKGA hat, sounds like his ultimate plan in all honesty. Create the most powerful entity and ensure his loyalty to the village by making him idolize ruling it. Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat. Now he has the hat, But really, the hat, and konoha, controls him.",

Konoha is safe, powerful, and dominant due to the overwhelming power of a weapon created by Konoha Shinobis. This is exactly what Danzo wanted. A figurehead that the people love and enemies fear under the control of Shinobis smarter than him- Danzo would want that role for himself I\u2019m sure. There has been a cult like dedication to the village cultivated through a war that united the nations. The obsession with the position of Hokage that drives Shinobi to get more and more powerful is still in place. If Danzo lived to see it I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be very happy with the world Naruto created.",

The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway.

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies.

Still it's funny that is the result of jiraya and everyone wanting peace but having to stop pain. In this case Naruto is little more than a pawn to defeat pain and restore konoha to greatness. Where is danzo with MKGA hat, sounds like his ultimate plan in all honesty. Create the most powerful entity and ensure his loyalty to the village by making him idolize ruling it. Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat. Now he has the hat, But really, the hat, and konoha, controls him.",

Konoha is safe, powerful, and dominant due to the overwhelming power of a weapon created by Konoha Shinobis. This is exactly what Danzo wanted. A figurehead that the people love and enemies fear under the control of Shinobis smarter than him- Danzo would want that role for himself I\u2019m sure. There has been a cult like dedication to the village cultivated through a war that united the nations. The obsession with the position of Hokage that drives Shinobi to get more and more powerful is still in place.

I find it implausible for crime to exist in a world where you\u2019re met with almost immediate retribution from a force so unstoppable that he could destroy the entire nation you\u2019re in within minutes. The man can destroy villages in seconds; if Naruto\u2019s power was as well known as I want it to be then all battles should end as soon as he\u2019s in the region. Every nation, illegal organisation, and terrorist group would have flee on sight orders. If the world knew what they were up against they would give up rather than fight him. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution and probably wouldn\u2019t bring everlasting peace (it\u2019s very similar to what pain/sasuke wanted as someone\u2019s pointed out to me) but there isn\u2019t peace in the Shinobi world anyway. They explored this with AllMight; the symbol of peace and power brought relative security. Naruto is much more powerful than AllMight and through clones he could basically patrol the world. When AllMight went away illegal organisations went on the attack. Would this happen in Naruto too? Probably.",

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem.

Maybe not immediately but the moment Naruto isn't there to protect them you best believe they would take aggressive approaches towards border disputes. War wouldn't happen immediately but they would begin plotting to overthrow an unaccountable force like that. The best thing for the kage is for everyone to know they are strong and let the name keep people away from messing with you and your people. Let other handle their problems but help them if they request it. The end result is the same, trouble makers quelled but one makes those you helped resent you and the other makes allies. You helped them requested it and you solved their problem.

Still it's funny that is the result of jiraya and everyone wanting peace but having to stop pain. In this case Naruto is little more than a pawn to defeat pain and restore konoha to greatness. Where is danzo with MKGA hat, sounds like his ultimate plan in all honesty. Create the most powerful entity and ensure his loyalty to the village by making him idolize ruling it. Then convince him that everyone who has power and doesn't do things our way is wrong and evil and boom. Jiraya, sarutobi, Kakashi, all deep agents of these state that purposefully made Naruto the way he is by acting certain ways. Hence the hokages two faced approach to young Naruto. Loving and caring in words but actions were extremely lacking. By making him fixate on the hokages figure as his only lifeline to humanity, he learned to love and be loyal to the hat. Now he has the hat, But really, the hat, and konoha, controls him.",

A figurehead that the people love and enemies fear under the control of Shinobis smarter than him- Danzo would want that role for himself I\u2019m sure. There has been a cult like dedication to the village cultivated through a war that united the nations.

Konoha is safe, powerful, and dominant due to the overwhelming power of a weapon created by Konoha Shinobis. This is exactly what Danzo wanted. A figurehead that the people love and enemies fear under the control of Shinobis smarter than him- Danzo would want that role for himself I\u2019m sure. There has been a cult like dedication to the village cultivated through a war that united the nations. The obsession with the position of Hokage that drives Shinobi to get more and more powerful is still in place. If Danzo lived to see it I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be very happy with the world Naruto created.",
