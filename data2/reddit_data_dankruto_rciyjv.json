They simply removed that possibility from happening again. You act like their fucking mansions we're the ghetto or some shit. Little kid over here.",

He would probably feel it was justified since the Uchiha took his family from him in the first place. I'd like to have seen this as a filler episode or something. A heartbroken Tobirama doing everything he can to get his family back only to learn that all he can do is bring back ghosts made of dust; at some point he'd need to decide to let his family move on (since we never see any old Senju summons guarding the village, they must have been released if they were ever made at all). \n\nBut I don't think Tobirama would trust a resurrected Uchiha to fight his clan members. First there's the chance that making an Uchiha fight his dead relative would instant awaken or upgrade the living Uchiha's Sharingan, which is a big uh-oh for the Senju hanging around that Uchiha. But then there's the chance that the resurrected Uchiha would break free from Tobirama's control. Half the combatants in the War arc seemed capable of doing so even when Kabuto was using the more advanced form of Edo Tensei.",

                            "body": "Why you gotta disrespect the first normal human hokage like that? Hashirama was the reincarnation if Ninja Jesus's favorite son, Tobirama was just a normal dude doing his best. Tobirama didn't make a habit out of killing Uchihas, even if he was pretty good at it; he just didn't share his brother's zealous desire to let bygones be bygones. \n\nOnce Hashirama negotiated a peace between the clans, Tobirama stopped fighting the Uchiha. He hired one of the Uchiha into his personal guard, and he tried to find a job that was 1) important to the village and 2) well suited for the Uchiha clan's talents. \n\nMaking the Uchiha into cops is a good move on paper. It shows trust in their skills and their judgment, you don't want to give untrustworthy people that kind of power. And the sharingan is probably an amazing tool for investigations: can see chakra, can follow fast movements and sleight of hand easily, can instantly recognize details of a face when a criminal or enemy is spotted briefly, can see tiny details of a crime scene, grants immunity to most genjutsu, grants ability to cast genjutsu to apprehend criminals alive, and grants enough of a combat boost to keep the police force alive if criminals fight back.\n\nHe did move the Uchiha outside of the main village, but this also gave them autonomy that they seemed to enjoy. Besides, other clans have similar setups without issue. The Hyuga have their own compounds and internal caste system that the viage leaves alone, and the Nara have a big private forest that they keep for hunting and training. \n\nIt's true that the Uchiha got stigmatized because of their role as the police; but that was mostly Danzo's fault, not Tobirama's. Tobirama was a stern man, and he did a poor job of long-term planning. But he was a decent enough leader for his time.\n\nEdit: typos",

He would probably feel it was justified since the Uchiha took his family from him in the first place. I'd like to have seen this as a filler episode or something. A heartbroken Tobirama doing everything he can to get his family back only to learn that all he can do is bring back ghosts made of dust; at some point he'd need to decide to let his family move on (since we never see any old Senju summons guarding the village, they must have been released if they were ever made at all). \n\nBut I don't think Tobirama would trust a resurrected Uchiha to fight his clan members. First there's the chance that making an Uchiha fight his dead relative would instant awaken or upgrade the living Uchiha's Sharingan, which is a big uh-oh for the Senju hanging around that Uchiha. But then there's the chance that the resurrected Uchiha would break free from Tobirama's control. Half the combatants in the War arc seemed capable of doing so even when Kabuto was using the more advanced form of Edo Tensei.",

Hashirama was the reincarnation if Ninja Jesus's favorite son, Tobirama was just a normal dude doing his best. Tobirama didn't make a habit out of killing Uchihas, even if he was pretty good at it; he just didn't share his brother's zealous desire to let bygones be bygones. \n\nOnce Hashirama negotiated a peace between the clans, Tobirama stopped fighting the Uchiha. He hired one of the Uchiha into his personal guard, and he tried to find a job that was 1) important to the village and 2) well suited for the Uchiha clan's talents. \n\nMaking the Uchiha into cops is a good move on paper. It shows trust in their skills and their judgment, you don't want to give untrustworthy people that kind of power. And the sharingan is probably an amazing tool for investigations: can see chakra, can follow fast movements and sleight of hand easily, can instantly recognize details of a face when a criminal or enemy is spotted briefly, can see tiny details of a crime scene, grants immunity to most genjutsu, grants ability to cast genjutsu to apprehend criminals alive, and grants enough of a combat boost to keep the police force alive if criminals fight back.\n\nHe did move the Uchiha outside of the main village, but this also gave them autonomy that they seemed to enjoy. Besides, other clans have similar setups without issue. The Hyuga have their own compounds and internal caste system that the viage leaves alone, and the Nara have a big private forest that they keep for hunting and training. \n\nIt's true that the Uchiha got stigmatized because of their role as the police; but that was mostly Danzo's fault, not Tobirama's. Tobirama was a stern man, and he did a poor job of long-term planning. But he was a decent enough leader for his time.\n\nEdit: typos",

Tobirama didn't make a habit out of killing Uchihas, even if he was pretty good at it; he just didn't share his brother's zealous desire to let bygones be bygones. \n\nOnce Hashirama negotiated a peace between the clans, Tobirama stopped fighting the Uchiha. He hired one of the Uchiha into his personal guard, and he tried to find a job that was 1) important to the village and 2) well suited for the Uchiha clan's talents. \n\nMaking the Uchiha into cops is a good move on paper. It shows trust in their skills and their judgment, you don't want to give untrustworthy people that kind of power. And the sharingan is probably an amazing tool for investigations: can see chakra, can follow fast movements and sleight of hand easily, can instantly recognize details of a face when a criminal or enemy is spotted briefly, can see tiny details of a crime scene, grants immunity to most genjutsu, grants ability to cast genjutsu to apprehend criminals alive, and grants enough of a combat boost to keep the police force alive if criminals fight back.\n\nHe did move the Uchiha outside of the main village, but this also gave them autonomy that they seemed to enjoy. Besides, other clans have similar setups without issue. The Hyuga have their own compounds and internal caste system that the viage leaves alone, and the Nara have a big private forest that they keep for hunting and training. \n\nIt's true that the Uchiha got stigmatized because of their role as the police; but that was mostly Danzo's fault, not Tobirama's. Tobirama was a stern man, and he did a poor job of long-term planning. But he was a decent enough leader for his time.\n\nEdit: typos",
