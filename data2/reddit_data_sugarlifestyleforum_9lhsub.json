    "body": "I read a lot of posts from SB\u2019s concerned about their ability to compete with with the super-hot competition.   I thought my current situation might help.\n\nI have been seeing SB1 for about 2 months.   She is truly gorgeous,  with a body that is simply flawless.  Strong sense of style and class.  Enjoyable to be around.   Super in bed.  Loves sex.  What more could I ask for?   Nothing.  Or so I thought.  \n\nI was about to deactivate on SA, and SB2 had messaged me.   She had been messaging me periodically, and I was never in a position to meet.  In spite of being content with SB1, there was something about SB2 that convinced me to meet her.  I did.  Pleasant looking girl,  but on a purely physical basis, she is not in the same league as SB1.  \n\nSB2 and I have super chemistry and soon progress to intimacy.  She has an off-the-charts fun personality, and comes across as very appreciative of having our relationship.  In fact, she comes across as thrilled to be together.  She never wants our evenings to end.  \n\nHer texts between meetings are erotic and fun, and include sensual pictures.   We are in touch almost every day.   Talks about missing me when we cannot meet, and laments gaps between getting laid as she puts it.  She regularly comments on the little things I do, when we are intimate.  SB1 is much more businesslike.  We don\u2019t communicate much, outside of setting up our appointments.   \n\nI don\u2019t have the bandwidth to support two SB\u2019s.  So now I need to choose.  Can\u2019t believe that I am seriously thinking of dropping SB1, because again, she is drop-dead gorgeous.   But there is no way I will stop seeing SB2.  We are just such a great match.  \n\nThe reason for this post?  You SB\u2019s who are intimidated by the prospect of super-hot women chasing down the same SD\u2019s should understand that there is so more to this game, than appearance.  I am seriously excited about the long-term potential of SB2.  ",

VERY business like in communication. Very short answers.  She does have a good heart though.  She does charity work and is passionate about it. However, she doesn't remember details of our conversations about the future or the past life experiences we've shared with each other.  She chooses not to pay attention as she can remember other things well.   IMO, she just really doesn't care that much about me as a person.  It's more business between us. Not really a friendship. \n \nSB2 not a beauty queen.  GND cute.  Fit figure, as she is a runner. A bright woman who's applying to Ivy League schools for her doctorate. I enjoy her sense of humor so much. We connect mentally so well.  In the bedroom she has come a long way.  She's now enjoying herself way more than the beginning.  We have become great partners in bed.    She trusts me.  A LOT.  Example:  In a rush to be on time to meet her, I left the allowance envelope at my office. I didn't notice until after I had picked her up and we arrived at our destination.  She said, \"No problem dear, you can venmo me later\"  wow.  That. is. trust.  (Of course I did follow through...)\n\nNow she's away for work for a month.  She wants to meet halfway and have an overnight.  She booked the hotel for us.\nNo SB has ever done that before.  She's a keeper.  Intellect and interest in me as a person towers over beauty with business like manner any day!  Beauty ain't all that.  SB2 for the win.",

She was a pre-school teacher in her early 20s who was cute in a girl-next-door kind of way.  She was sweet, smart and fun.  Really fond of memories of our time together.  It ended because she started a vanilla relationship with another woman, but we're still in touch as friends.\n\nAlso, sometimes the super hot women are difficult to pin down.  I have a semi-regular SB who's a working model and it can be really tough to get her to commit to spending time with me.  Also, she's occasionally vanished when she's met someone who pays her an exorbitant allowance, which I understand, but takes away from the idea of being in an arrangement to make me feel like a beautiful young woman is fawning over me.  While I know it's mostly an illusion, the fantasy is still nice.",

Her message was structured in a way I have never seen.  Normally, what you get from that question is a recital of what she wants.   She didn\u2019t do that at all.  \n\nInstead she placed the two of us in the future when our arrangement was up and running.  She then described all the great things that would go on between the two of us, as if they were assuredly going to happen.  She had this vision in her head that she put down in writing.   \n\nPrior to doing that, she told me that she liked the way I communicated.   As if it was rare to her.   So maybe she was motivated to paint this picture of the future.   There was quite a bit about how we would be friends, care about each other, travel/explore, share our hopes and dreams, and have a ton of fun.  She also had a very tactful way of suggesting how intimacy was going to be part of the deal.   It was also clear that she wanted financial support, to help make her life easier, while working on her goals.  \n\nThe thing is, we are still new, but her vision of the future is proving pretty damn accurate.   Much of it is yet to unfold, but it feels like we are on the way to fulfilling her vision.   I have never seen an intro message anything like what she presented.  What is so compelling is how she seems so thrilled about how this is all unfolding.  It all feels genuine.   This is an intelligent young woman.  She is double majoring, has started a book, and wants to get a PhD.  She also has a vision about the kind of impact she wants to have on the world, which she is just starting to fill me in on.   And every once in a while she hits me out of the blue with these porno-quality texts.   I never know what is coming next.  ",

She proposed a lunch just so we could avoid a two week absence.  Expecting no comp.  We settled on a breakfast, where I provided a small token gift.  This kind of attitude means a lot to me.  SB1 just stops communicating when I travel. \n\nI wish I had the bandwidth to keep seeing both, but each of them have a weekly expectation which I can\u2019t do.

Normally, what you get from that question is a recital of what she wants.   She didn\u2019t do that at all.  \n\nInstead she placed the two of us in the future when our arrangement was up and running.  She then described all the great things that would go on between the two of us, as if they were assuredly going to happen.  She had this vision in her head that she put down in writing.   \n\nPrior to doing that, she told me that she liked the way I communicated.   As if it was rare to her.   So maybe she was motivated to paint this picture of the future.   There was quite a bit about how we would be friends, care about each other, travel/explore, share our hopes and dreams, and have a ton of fun.  She also had a very tactful way of suggesting how intimacy was going to be part of the deal.   It was also clear that she wanted financial support, to help make her life easier, while working on her goals.  \n\nThe thing is, we are still new, but her vision of the future is proving pretty damn accurate.   Much of it is yet to unfold, but it feels like we are on the way to fulfilling her vision.   I have never seen an intro message anything like what she presented.  What is so compelling is how she seems so thrilled about how this is all unfolding.  It all feels genuine.   This is an intelligent young woman.  She is double majoring, has started a book, and wants to get a PhD.  She also has a vision about the kind of impact she wants to have on the world, which she is just starting to fill me in on.   And every once in a while she hits me out of the blue with these porno-quality texts.   I never know what is coming next.  ",
