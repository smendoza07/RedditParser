The latter 2 I knew I wouldn't commit to daily, so I just tried 1mg of oral finasteride per day. As you can see by 2 years in, I was more than happy, and stopped taking photos.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Although hard to tell in the 2021 photos, (as it was only just starting) I felt I was finally starting to thin out again, very slowly. I believe this won't happen to most people after only 9 years, but as mentioned, I have very aggressive balding.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 I still believed I would not stick to daily min+derma, so I went with oral min instead, 2.5mg twice a day.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 No real side effects at all from the finasteride, I have never noticed any changes at all.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Side effects for the oral min, rather than topical, is that it is full body effective. Mostly the chest area and above, both front and back.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 I never really had any change in my chest hair, and the small white hair I did have on my back is maybe slightly darker, but barely different.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 A nice bonus, is that my beard (While I keep it at \"designer stubble\" length, is now much fuller and not patches.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 I now have a small amount of temple hair growing from my eyebrows to my hairline, however I shave this every second beard shave I do, and it keeps it in check. My beard hair also now grows higher up my cheeks, but same deal.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Please ask questions, I made no choices lightly, I've read almost every study on both drugs, as well as others, recommended youtubers, as many recommend, is MorePlatesMoreDates, and some doctors that live here with me in Australia, The Hair Loss Show.",

Since DHT plays an important role in reaching physical maturation during puberty. I'm 17 and I've experienced minor loss of density (nothing noticeable yet) and I'm still near a NW1 thankfully. I've been planning on starting finasteride ASAP because I'm quite sure that my puberty has finally come to an end (I can grow facial hair, have a fully developed junk, body hair, etc.) and I don't want to take the risk and hope that my hair loss will stop on its own. My main question is, did you hop on finasteride by the age of 15-16 knowing well that your puberty has ended?",

Your 2012-15 results are maybe the best on this sub and your 2021-22 are also up there.\n\nWhen you say you couldn\u2019t commit to topical minoxidil, what do you mean? Is there an efficacy component in your decision to go with oral min vs topical despite a worse side effect profile or was it purely convenience based?\n\nIt takes me a minute or so to apply it (it will take longer with long hair) and I do it 2x per day. When applied topically it has a half-life of over 20hr so I could easily get away with one application. The time component alone is no where near enough of a sell for me.

This is the most important part, you'll need to talk to your doctor for a prescription, or go through an online company to get it. \nFinasteride is going to stop your body producing as much DHT, a hormone that causes hairloss. This will both reverse your hairloss, and prevent it from progressing.\nCatching it early, you may find that this is enough, and all you need to use for the next 20 years.",

Minoxidil simply places your hair in a growth phase all at the same time, and for as long as you use it. But hair follicles can still minaturise and die, which is what cases balding. Finasteride actually stops hair follicles from dieing, which is why it's more important than Minoxidil.",

Minoxidil works by increasing the blood flow to the area it's applied, so hair follicles which got old/closed/which never opened get more blood flow and become active. Have I misunderstood something?\n\nAnd derma roller increase the absorption of minoxidil and derma roller independently also increase blood flow.\n\nActually, I can't use Finasteride due some issues.",

Since DHT plays an important role in reaching physical maturation during puberty. I'm 17 and I've experienced minor loss of density (nothing noticeable yet) and I'm still near a NW1 thankfully. I've been planning on starting finasteride ASAP because I'm quite sure that my puberty has finally come to an end (I can grow facial hair, have a fully developed junk, body hair, etc.) and I don't want to take the risk and hope that my hair loss will stop on its own. My main question is, did you hop on finasteride by the age of 15-16 knowing well that your puberty has ended?",

The mechanism is that since free test can\u2019t convert into DHT through 5ar reductase it aromatises into Estrogen, this caused me gyno and i had to hop off Finasteride, i was even using topical which has a lower affinity for serum DHT reduction.\n\nI still recommend Fin to balding people and believe that most don\u2019t get Gyno.",
