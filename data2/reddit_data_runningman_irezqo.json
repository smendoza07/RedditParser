Also, in the early episodes, really sad for seok Jin being the least famous one and the weakest especially when they travel abroad, I can't really see some fans of him and that will really get him feel out of place from the other members which will really lead of him to just leave the show. But gladly both weaklings thought that they just need each other in order to be strong and the start of feel touch cross leads to development of their characters. Kwang soo and Seok Jin both get competitive and strong that it's ok to be alone anymore. Seok Jin not always getting out first and Kwang soo learns to fight back and not be a coward against the members especially Jong kook.",
