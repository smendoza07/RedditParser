    "body": "Lately there have been many posts asking both babies and daddies why they sugar. I\u2019ve been in and out of this beautiful bowl for over 20 years now. After a deep, emotional conversation with one of my closest friends yesterday, I finally have an answer. \n\nIt\u2019s not the money. Yes it\u2019s lovely and helps me live a more comfortable life but it\u2019s never been my primary motivation. I didn\u2019t *need* the money when I started sugaring and I certainly don\u2019t *need* it at my age (41 in case you were wondering). \n\nI sugar because I love gentlemen. And the sugar world is one of the only places to find true gentlemen. Men that will open doors for women, bring flowers and presents just to see me smile, have intelligent conversations, and pick up the check. If you know me in any other aspect of my life, you\u2019d never imagine that an independent girl like me would want that. But I do. I love the idea of having a man provide for me and take care of me. And that is not an easy thing for me to admit.",

Or why we do it.\n\nIn my case, I am actually enabling my SB to live in a different city, meaning we see each other less often.   She has dreams she wants to pursue there, and I want to see her happy.  Kind of at my own expense, but not really.  She could not afford to do this without me helping.  At least right now.   You have to dig deeper to understand what this does for me.\n\nI had no agenda when I decided to try and maintain a long distance arrangement. Just that I wanted to keep seeing her, and maximize her happiness.   But she now considers me one of the most important people in her life.  We communicate every day, and she confides in me whenever she needs help.  If she is down or lonely in the new city, we get on FaceTime and talk endlessly.   There is a deep friendship here and beyond.  The things she has told me about how she feels about me, might not be believable with our huge age gap.   Not even here.\n\nIt is not all one directional.   I have a travel partner that Covid has derailed to some degree, but that is temporary.  There are times when life gets the better of me, and she is ALWAYS there.   Sometimes virtually.   Sometimes in person.\n\nShe came back to visit yesterday, and the first person she saw was me.  We are going to spend the afternoon and evening together.   We never count hours, and she is always enthused about meeting.  If someone had told me a while a while back that I would end up in a relationship like this with a young twenty-something, crazy attractive woman, I would have asked them what they were smoking.  But here I am.  \n\nOnce again, loved your \u201cconfession\u201d.",
