I just struggle to understand why some people act like it makes them superior. I\u2019ll also admit that sometimes the sub voices are more fitting but it\u2019s rare that it bothers me enough to watch it in Japanese. I tend to watch dub if it\u2019s conveniently available. If not I\u2019ve got no issue with subs. I\u2019m also not willing to wait an extra year or two for the dub to come out. I used to be strictly dub until I realized how ridiculous it was to wait that fucking long for it.",

I just struggle to understand why some people act like it makes them superior.
