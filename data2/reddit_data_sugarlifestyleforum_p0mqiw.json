    "body": "So, I recently turned 21, but a lot of people think I look significantly younger than that. They tell me it's a compliment but it definitely doesn't feel like a good thing to be told I look like a minor. Anyway, I've had several SDs who have made comments about how hot I am and how much they want to sleep with me... and then later on when my age gets brought up they say \"Oh really? I thought you were 16\" or somewhere around there, and I just... am I the asshole for breaking it off with them immediately? It just makes me super uncomfortable that they wanted intimacy with someone who they thought I was a minor, and that they possibly liked me specifically because they thought I was a minor. Even though I'm not, it just gives off the vibes that they probably have slept with minors in the past and I just don't want to associate with that. One guy seemed super nice and it just hurt to hear he thought I was that young and was still interested. Is this a common thing or do I just have bad luck?",

I personally would never tell a young woman she looks young, that\u2019s not a good complement, but a young woman telling an older man he looks young is and I get that all the time. So perhaps it is a sign that these men aren\u2019t emotionally mature, maybe ask what they think about being with a very young woman would be like to see if they come off as more sensible or perverted in their response.",

That doesn't mean everyone who is interested in that stuff is actually trying to sleep with minors or their sister/mother, it's a form of role-play that is a turn on to pretend because it's taboo.\n\nYou can obviously do whatever you want, but calling anyone who is attracted to you because you look young a \"predator\" is laughable (mostly talking about the comments). Most mainstream would probably call any man interested in a woman 20 years his junior is a predator, so that's pretty much all of us (something about glass houses...)",

Is that still creepy? Some things that turn us on, we really have no control over. All we can control is what we do and how we conduct ourselves. Like if I think someone is a minor and is attractive, I am not approaching her. But if I learn she's 21, is very attractive and has that surprisingly young-ish look, and is interested in older guys for a sugar relationship, is that so wrong to be interested in dating her at that point? If that's the look you have then it sounds like you're trying to filter out everyone until you get guys saying \"I didn't think you look young at all\" and that may not be realistic.",
