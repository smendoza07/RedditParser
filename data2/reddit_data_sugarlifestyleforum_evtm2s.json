    "body": "I've decided my market is just full of overgrown frat boys looking for an easy lay.\n\nThey say it all the time that SA is full of baby SBs trying to duck out on their side of the arrangement... but I'm feeling like it's just as bad on the flip side of things.\n\nI'm sorry for requiring to meet you somewhere besides your couch for the first time. Maybe things will progress naturally and end up that way, if we click and I feel safe...but please dont make assumptions.\n\nI'm not trying to get something for nothing but it feels like that's the new consensus. Do you want to go out or just come to my house... DUDE I dont know you... SO YEAH some witnesses would be nice.\n\nI'm not trying to string you along...I'm just trying to make sure I can go home at the end of the night in one piece.\n\nIf I were interested in the random hook up...there's other places to find like minded people...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK SORRY, Mini rant over.",

Established men has a low number to pick from but most of the men on the site want a long term arrangement and are generous/sincere. Secret Benefits advertises on Eros so if you are looking long term make sure to relay that you are looking long term mutual. My current is actually from SB and I couldn\u2019t be more happy.",

Then in 15 mins she bluntly tells me she normally does not waste time meeting guys in bars, she wants to make things happens fast. She likes me and asks if we could go back to my place. \n\nAt that moment I have had enough and tell her I need to leave and if I can help her get an uber back home? She is like well let me text my friend so he can come and pick me up. I thank her for the time, clear the check and we walk out. From there she disappeared in the darkness!",

I\u2019d say that is fortunately rare with SA too, but the risk is real. And that\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t rush back to the residence of someone you don\u2019t know yet.\n\nBut this post goes and conflates cheap-ass phony SDs with serial killers.

People are annoyed when celebrities complain (some are anyway, I think anyone is allowed to be vocal about being poorly treated?) because they willingly put themselves in the spot light. \n\nYou seem to think that because being a woman comes with certain perceived \u201cbenefits\u201d it\u2019s somehow bad form to complain about the insanely shitty parts of it? You\u2019re doing more feeling than reasoning here.",
