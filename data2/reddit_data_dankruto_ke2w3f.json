When he does, the situation would most probably not be as bad as during the middle of the war, hence his emotions won't be as intense either, and we know that dojutsu is fueled by hatred and emotion (i think it was Tobirama who revealed that?).

First, is there even any evidence that the severity of the trauma that awakens the sharingan correlates to the strength? Second, even if that is true, how do you know what traumas Obito might have experienced in this alternative timeline? Naruto and his crew experienced a lot of trauma as children, and they were never technically at war.\n\n>Even if war never happened, there are several missions that are very, very difficult. Groups like Akatsuki would still exist.

He only has his fire jutsu besides the sharingan, pretty much like most other average Uchiha members.\n\nAs a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning.\n\nThe most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's, showing what Obito could have turned out like if he didn't turn evil. That's literally why he turned good again at the end of the war arc. He would have tried his hardest to reach his potential with or without Marada. Again, not saying he would be as powerful, but he was always going to turn out above average imo.",

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou. He already had awakened his Sharingan by this point after Kakashi lost his eye. Not even that traumatic of an event.\n\nAlso, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

When Sasuke used it when he fought it the reason he was tired after was because he used Shedding Skin jutsu that takes a lot of chakra.

This Itachi had been using his MS for years, hence, he was on the verge of blindness and he did become practically blind at the end. The conclusion, **Itachi couldn't use the MS to it's full potential**. Second, he was sick from a disease, **so definitely not at his prime**, then there's the argument he held back because he wanted Sasuke to live, but let's ignore that.\n\n>Next is Itachi had Fugaku, Shisui & other people training him at a young age. if Sasuke had MS before he fought Itachi he would win 7/10 times.\n\nFugaku barely trained Itachi, I think the only thing he did was showcase the fireball jutsu (just like with Sasuke). Otherwise, the only person who trained him was Shisui and self-training. Your point is that Sasuke had more potential than Itachi, **which I agree with**, so there's no point in debating over this. Also, Im pretty sure MS Sasuke would take down MS Itachi (he *did* kill Danzo 10 times, after fighting four kage and several samurai)\n\n>Tsukuyomi (he can breakout) Amaterasu (he can control it) Izanami (useless Sasuke isn't trying to be...\n\nThis para assumes that Sasuke knows all of Itachi's abilities and has planned a counter for all of them beforehand, the element of surprise is a big factor in this fight. In the fight, Sasuke went all out with his final attack, believing that Itachi had nothing in his arsenal left, and yet, Itachi pulled out a mf Susanoo with 2 legendary weapons.\n\nThe thing with Itachi is, he was a prodigy. The youngest to graduate after Kakashi (and I think the only reason Kakashi graduated unnecessarily early was because people were required in the ongoing war). He beat Anbu along with Shisui when his age wasn't in double digits. As an adult, he doesn't appear that strong is because of two things, **1)** There would have to be stronger people unless Itachi is the final antagonist, which he wasn't. **2)** After the massacre, he went to the Akatsuki, pretty sure he didn't have time for training there. After the first couple of missions where he probably unlocked all his MS abilities, it was basically his prime. Itachi is also very, very smart, certainly smarted than Sasuke, call it his natural intelligence or more experience.\n\nJust take EMS Itachi, he fought on par with KCM1 Naruto and Killer B and took down all of Nagato's beasts and also saved Naruto from Nagato. He also mostly single-handedly took down Sage Kabuto. Sure this power gap seems a little ridiculous, but it is cannon so...\n\nI like to compare Edo Itachi with a hypothetical EMS Itachi, since he has infinite chakra, he can spam his MS abilities forever. Probably the only thing that EMS Itachi would do more is get a Perfect Susanoo, but that's just speculation.",

Naruto was holding back because he wanted to talk to Itachi. That's like saying if Itachi was physically fighting Ay that wasn't trying to win he's physically stronger even though Ay wasn't serious.\n\nBoth Itachi and Sasuke where holding back vs Kabuto. All Sasuke had to do was set the whole cave on fire with Amaterasu even Sage Kabuto can't keep Shedding his skin.\n\nThe reason Sasuke just didn't kill Kabuto is because Itachi wanted to undo Edo Tensei he told him to hold back.",

Kabuto was one hell of a sneaky ninja, he's not *that* weak. But my point was that Edo Itachi was quite strong, which you seem to get so no point in arguing over this.",

He ordered for the Uchiha to be relocated after the Kyuubi Rampage, obviously this would enrage the Uchiha as they were being punished for something they didn't do.

Fun Fact: Just the day before the Uchiha were supposed to launch the coup, Hiruzen cut off the funding for the Uchiha police force on the advice of Danzo. The center was not listening to them, they were being ostracized, they were being judged for something they didn't do, what do you expect them to do?\n\nBesides, it was a Radical Faction inside the Uchiha who actually wanted to launch the coup, elders like Fugaku were opposed but in the end, he had to accept because the Radicals would've done it anyway.\n\nYou could make the argument that it was Obito who caused the Kyuubi Rampage, indirectly causing all of this.

First, is there even any evidence that the severity of the trauma that awakens the sharingan correlates to the strength?

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend.

This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

What makes Orochimaru hard to kill is his regeneration & Edo Tensei.\n\nFire style Itachi (MS) vs 16yr Sasuke (No MS) Sasuke is stronger than (Adult Itachi) he broke out of Tsukuyomi & Sasuke's fire style is stronger he managed to push Itachi's fire back until Itachi was forced to use Amaterasu.\n\nItachi never created a jutsu as strong or stronger than 16yr Sasuke's KIRIN even Itachi admitted if he didn't active his asspull Susano he would have died.\n\nSpeaking of Itachi's Susano where did he get that magical sword (Totsuka) & shield (Yata)? He said he wanted to protect his brother but he didn't give Sasuke does weapons instead Sasuke had to create his OWN weapons with his Amaterasu flames.\n\nNext is Itachi had Fugaku, Shisui & other people training him at a young age why'll Sasuke had no one. If Sasuke had the same training Itachi had or if Sasuke had MS before he fought Itachi he would win 7/10 times.\n\nTsukuyomi (he can breakout) Amaterasu (he can control it) Izanami (useless Sasuke isn't trying to be anyone else) Izunagi (Itachi only has two eyes) Susano Sasuke is fast enough to dodge it he can reverse summon or just summon Garuda to fly out of Itachi's reach wait for him to run out of chakra so he can't use Susano & spam Kirin.\n\nBefore you say Kirin makes Sasuke tired that's been disproven twice. When Sasuke used it when he fought it the reason he was tired after was because he used Shedding Skin jutsu that takes a lot of chakra. When Sasuke used it against Naruto in VOTE 2 (Kishi said that add-on is canon) & the last time he used it was on That one Otsusuki guy (Kishi said it's canon the whole manga/anime sucks that was the only good part).",

This Itachi had been using his MS for years, hence, he was on the verge of blindness and he did become practically blind at the end. The conclusion, **Itachi couldn't use the MS to it's full potential**. Second, he was sick from a disease, **so definitely not at his prime**, then there's the argument he held back because he wanted Sasuke to live, but let's ignore that.\n\n>Next is Itachi had Fugaku, Shisui & other people training him at a young age. if Sasuke had MS before he fought Itachi he would win 7/10 times.\n\nFugaku barely trained Itachi, I think the only thing he did was showcase the fireball jutsu (just like with Sasuke). Otherwise, the only person who trained him was Shisui and self-training. Your point is that Sasuke had more potential than Itachi, **which I agree with**, so there's no point in debating over this. Also, Im pretty sure MS Sasuke would take down MS Itachi (he *did* kill Danzo 10 times, after fighting four kage and several samurai)\n\n>Tsukuyomi (he can breakout) Amaterasu (he can control it) Izanami (useless Sasuke isn't trying to be...\n\nThis para assumes that Sasuke knows all of Itachi's abilities and has planned a counter for all of them beforehand, the element of surprise is a big factor in this fight. In the fight, Sasuke went all out with his final attack, believing that Itachi had nothing in his arsenal left, and yet, Itachi pulled out a mf Susanoo with 2 legendary weapons.\n\nThe thing with Itachi is, he was a prodigy. The youngest to graduate after Kakashi (and I think the only reason Kakashi graduated unnecessarily early was because people were required in the ongoing war). He beat Anbu along with Shisui when his age wasn't in double digits. As an adult, he doesn't appear that strong is because of two things, **1)** There would have to be stronger people unless Itachi is the final antagonist, which he wasn't. **2)** After the massacre, he went to the Akatsuki, pretty sure he didn't have time for training there. After the first couple of missions where he probably unlocked all his MS abilities, it was basically his prime. Itachi is also very, very smart, certainly smarted than Sasuke, call it his natural intelligence or more experience.\n\nJust take EMS Itachi, he fought on par with KCM1 Naruto and Killer B and took down all of Nagato's beasts and also saved Naruto from Nagato. He also mostly single-handedly took down Sage Kabuto. Sure this power gap seems a little ridiculous, but it is cannon so...\n\nI like to compare Edo Itachi with a hypothetical EMS Itachi, since he has infinite chakra, he can spam his MS abilities forever. Probably the only thing that EMS Itachi would do more is get a Perfect Susanoo, but that's just speculation.",

He ordered for the Uchiha to be relocated after the Kyuubi Rampage, obviously this would enrage the Uchiha as they were being punished for something they didn't do. But they were still dormant, seeking some way of being treated regularly again. Hiruzen made matters worse, by not really listening to the Uchiha. Fun Fact: Just the day before the Uchiha were supposed to launch the coup, Hiruzen cut off the funding for the Uchiha police force on the advice of Danzo. The center was not listening to them, they were being ostracized, they were being judged for something they didn't do, what do you expect them to do?\n\nBesides, it was a Radical Faction inside the Uchiha who actually wanted to launch the coup, elders like Fugaku were opposed but in the end, he had to accept because the Radicals would've done it anyway.\n\nYou could make the argument that it was Obito who caused the Kyuubi Rampage, indirectly causing all of this.

First, is there even any evidence that the severity of the trauma that awakens the sharingan correlates to the strength?

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend.

This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

What makes Orochimaru hard to kill is his regeneration & Edo Tensei.\n\nFire style Itachi (MS) vs 16yr Sasuke (No MS) Sasuke is stronger than (Adult Itachi) he broke out of Tsukuyomi & Sasuke's fire style is stronger he managed to push Itachi's fire back until Itachi was forced to use Amaterasu.\n\nItachi never created a jutsu as strong or stronger than 16yr Sasuke's KIRIN even Itachi admitted if he didn't active his asspull Susano he would have died.\n\nSpeaking of Itachi's Susano where did he get that magical sword (Totsuka) & shield (Yata)? He said he wanted to protect his brother but he didn't give Sasuke does weapons instead Sasuke had to create his OWN weapons with his Amaterasu flames.\n\nNext is Itachi had Fugaku, Shisui & other people training him at a young age why'll Sasuke had no one. If Sasuke had the same training Itachi had or if Sasuke had MS before he fought Itachi he would win 7/10 times.\n\nTsukuyomi (he can breakout) Amaterasu (he can control it) Izanami (useless Sasuke isn't trying to be anyone else) Izunagi (Itachi only has two eyes) Susano Sasuke is fast enough to dodge it he can reverse summon or just summon Garuda to fly out of Itachi's reach wait for him to run out of chakra so he can't use Susano & spam Kirin.\n\nBefore you say Kirin makes Sasuke tired that's been disproven twice. When Sasuke used it when he fought it the reason he was tired after was because he used Shedding Skin jutsu that takes a lot of chakra. When Sasuke used it against Naruto in VOTE 2 (Kishi said that add-on is canon) & the last time he used it was on That one Otsusuki guy (Kishi said it's canon the whole manga/anime sucks that was the only good part).",

                    "body": "Alright first, it's not fair to compare the Itachi that was about to die to a perfectly healthy young Sasuke. This Itachi had been using his MS for years, hence, he was on the verge of blindness and he did become practically blind at the end. The conclusion, **Itachi couldn't use the MS to it's full potential**. Second, he was sick from a disease, **so definitely not at his prime**, then there's the argument he held back because he wanted Sasuke to live, but let's ignore that.\n\n>Next is Itachi had Fugaku, Shisui & other people training him at a young age. if Sasuke had MS before he fought Itachi he would win 7/10 times.\n\nFugaku barely trained Itachi, I think the only thing he did was showcase the fireball jutsu (just like with Sasuke). Otherwise, the only person who trained him was Shisui and self-training. Your point is that Sasuke had more potential than Itachi, **which I agree with**, so there's no point in debating over this. Also, Im pretty sure MS Sasuke would take down MS Itachi (he *did* kill Danzo 10 times, after fighting four kage and several samurai)\n\n>Tsukuyomi (he can breakout) Amaterasu (he can control it) Izanami (useless Sasuke isn't trying to be...\n\nThis para assumes that Sasuke knows all of Itachi's abilities and has planned a counter for all of them beforehand, the element of surprise is a big factor in this fight. In the fight, Sasuke went all out with his final attack, believing that Itachi had nothing in his arsenal left, and yet, Itachi pulled out a mf Susanoo with 2 legendary weapons.\n\nThe thing with Itachi is, he was a prodigy. The youngest to graduate after Kakashi (and I think the only reason Kakashi graduated unnecessarily early was because people were required in the ongoing war). He beat Anbu along with Shisui when his age wasn't in double digits. As an adult, he doesn't appear that strong is because of two things, **1)** There would have to be stronger people unless Itachi is the final antagonist, which he wasn't. **2)** After the massacre, he went to the Akatsuki, pretty sure he didn't have time for training there. After the first couple of missions where he probably unlocked all his MS abilities, it was basically his prime. Itachi is also very, very smart, certainly smarted than Sasuke, call it his natural intelligence or more experience.\n\nJust take EMS Itachi, he fought on par with KCM1 Naruto and Killer B and took down all of Nagato's beasts and also saved Naruto from Nagato. He also mostly single-handedly took down Sage Kabuto. Sure this power gap seems a little ridiculous, but it is cannon so...\n\nI like to compare Edo Itachi with a hypothetical EMS Itachi, since he has infinite chakra, he can spam his MS abilities forever. Probably the only thing that EMS Itachi would do more is get a Perfect Susanoo, but that's just speculation.",

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou.

This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

            "body": "Alright first, it's not fair to compare the Itachi that was about to die to a perfectly healthy young Sasuke. This Itachi had been using his MS for years, hence, he was on the verge of blindness and he did become practically blind at the end. The conclusion, **Itachi couldn't use the MS to it's full potential**. Second, he was sick from a disease, **so definitely not at his prime**, then there's the argument he held back because he wanted Sasuke to live, but let's ignore that.\n\n>Next is Itachi had Fugaku, Shisui & other people training him at a young age. if Sasuke had MS before he fought Itachi he would win 7/10 times.\n\nFugaku barely trained Itachi, I think the only thing he did was showcase the fireball jutsu (just like with Sasuke). Otherwise, the only person who trained him was Shisui and self-training. Your point is that Sasuke had more potential than Itachi, **which I agree with**, so there's no point in debating over this. Also, Im pretty sure MS Sasuke would take down MS Itachi (he *did* kill Danzo 10 times, after fighting four kage and several samurai)\n\n>Tsukuyomi (he can breakout) Amaterasu (he can control it) Izanami (useless Sasuke isn't trying to be...\n\nThis para assumes that Sasuke knows all of Itachi's abilities and has planned a counter for all of them beforehand, the element of surprise is a big factor in this fight. In the fight, Sasuke went all out with his final attack, believing that Itachi had nothing in his arsenal left, and yet, Itachi pulled out a mf Susanoo with 2 legendary weapons.\n\nThe thing with Itachi is, he was a prodigy. The youngest to graduate after Kakashi (and I think the only reason Kakashi graduated unnecessarily early was because people were required in the ongoing war). He beat Anbu along with Shisui when his age wasn't in double digits. As an adult, he doesn't appear that strong is because of two things, **1)** There would have to be stronger people unless Itachi is the final antagonist, which he wasn't. **2)** After the massacre, he went to the Akatsuki, pretty sure he didn't have time for training there. After the first couple of missions where he probably unlocked all his MS abilities, it was basically his prime. Itachi is also very, very smart, certainly smarted than Sasuke, call it his natural intelligence or more experience.\n\nJust take EMS Itachi, he fought on par with KCM1 Naruto and Killer B and took down all of Nagato's beasts and also saved Naruto from Nagato. He also mostly single-handedly took down Sage Kabuto. Sure this power gap seems a little ridiculous, but it is cannon so...\n\nI like to compare Edo Itachi with a hypothetical EMS Itachi, since he has infinite chakra, he can spam his MS abilities forever. Probably the only thing that EMS Itachi would do more is get a Perfect Susanoo, but that's just speculation.",

Kabuto was one hell of a sneaky ninja, he's not *that* weak. But my point was that Edo Itachi was quite strong, which you seem to get so no point in arguing over this.",

First, is there even any evidence that the severity of the trauma that awakens the sharingan correlates to the strength?

Naruto and his crew experienced a lot of trauma as children, and they were never technically at war.\n\n>Even if war never happened, there are several missions that are very, very difficult.

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou. He already had awakened his Sharingan by this point after Kakashi lost his eye. Not even that traumatic of an event.\n\nAlso, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

He ordered for the Uchiha to be relocated after the Kyuubi Rampage, obviously this would enrage the Uchiha as they were being punished for something they didn't do. But they were still dormant, seeking some way of being treated regularly again. Hiruzen made matters worse, by not really listening to the Uchiha. Fun Fact: Just the day before the Uchiha were supposed to launch the coup, Hiruzen cut off the funding for the Uchiha police force on the advice of Danzo. The center was not listening to them, they were being ostracized, they were being judged for something they didn't do, what do you expect them to do?\n\nBesides, it was a Radical Faction inside the Uchiha who actually wanted to launch the coup, elders like Fugaku were opposed but in the end, he had to accept because the Radicals would've done it anyway.\n\nYou could make the argument that it was Obito who caused the Kyuubi Rampage, indirectly causing all of this. But Danzo is much more at fault here.",

First, is there even any evidence that the severity of the trauma that awakens the sharingan correlates to the strength? Second, even if that is true, how do you know what traumas Obito might have experienced in this alternative timeline? Naruto and his crew experienced a lot of trauma as children, and they were never technically at war.\n\n>Even if war never happened, there are several missions that are very, very difficult.

His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's, showing what Obito could have turned out like if he didn't turn evil. That's literally why he turned good again at the end of the war arc. He would have tried his hardest to reach his potential with or without Marada. Again, not saying he would be as powerful, but he was always going to turn out above average imo.",

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou. He already had awakened his Sharingan by this point after Kakashi lost his eye. Not even that traumatic of an event.\n\nAlso, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's, showing what Obito could have turned out like if he didn't turn evil. That's literally why he turned good again at the end of the war arc. He would have tried his hardest to reach his potential with or without Marada. Again, not saying he would be as powerful, but he was always going to turn out above average imo.",

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou. He already had awakened his Sharingan by this point after Kakashi lost his eye. Not even that traumatic of an event.\n\nAlso, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

What Im saying is that the chances that the trauma he faces in this world won't be as bad as the cannon. Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito, in a timeline where war doesn't exist, why would someone in this timeline want to push Obito, a mere average kid, this far? Of course, it all depends on the writing. We really can't say much without assuming a lot of things.\n\n>Thank you for reinforcing my previous point\n\nWhat I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker. So even if he didn't reach the level we saw in the show, he could still very well be better than average\", the standard for average won't be much lower, what we consider average in the cannon, is roughly the same as in this timeline.\n\n>As a child, yes...you are ignoring the fact that he would keep growing and learning\n\nMaybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage. But then again, Itachi and Shisui won't be the same as there was no war... our debate is pointless lol, the story can go anyways.\n\n>The most important thing is that he had the drive, and wanted to be hokage. His attitude was a parralel to Naruto's\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is that Naruto relies heavily on the Kyuubi chakra. Obito only has the sharingan here, so he doesn't have nearly enough skills as Naruto, even if he has the same determination. But, Naruto has Shadow Clones, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, which do make him Kage Level, so I guess Obito could become pretty strong too, it's just, just analysing his character as a child, ignoring his character in the future, it's kinda hard to see him become a great shinobi in the future.\n\nThis whole debate is pointless, we're debating what would happen if a literal war didn't happen, the war that shaped 80% of the events of the entire show",

                    "body": ">iirc, Tobirama said something very similar when he was revived, the strength of an Uchiha is proportional to his/her suffering.\n\nI think he just said that Uchiha are cursed because once they open the sharingan, they start lusting for more power, and the easiest way for them to gain power is through experiencing pain and suffering. That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou. He already had awakened his Sharingan by this point after Kakashi lost his eye. Not even that traumatic of an event.\n\nAlso, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",

That's a bit different from what you're suggesting.\n\n>Think about it, your best friend stabs your other best friend. The sensei is nowhere to be seen, you feel betrayed, in denial, angry, confused, and just break apart. That's what happened to Obito,\n\nNo, this is when he unlocks his Mangekyou. He already had awakened his Sharingan by this point after Kakashi lost his eye. Not even that traumatic of an event.\n\nAlso, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not.\n\n>What I said was that the standard would barely go down, what you said was that \"if war never happened, EVERYONE would be weaker.\n\nYes, this is true though. As you said, perhaps not a great deal weaker since there are still conflicts and criminal organizations. My follow up point is that that also means there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war.\n\n>Maybe he learns some new ninjutsu, maybe he learns a new elemental release. That's not nearly close enough to the tier of Itachi or Shisui or other candidates fit to be Hokage.\n\nBut this is a timeline where war didn't happen....so none of these guys would be as strong since you just said war is where they get trauma and unlock their sharingan power. If they can unlock their power without war, so can Obito.\n\nAnd yeah you're right this debate is pointless, that's kind of what I've been saying. We have no idea what would happen and it's wrong to assume he'd be less than average.",

Not even that traumatic of an event\n\nLook at it this way, Sharingan Obito was very average compared to the average Uchiha, while MS Obito was massively stronger due to his Kamui. If the logic that the more traumatic event, the more stronger dojutsu holds, then Obito will be much weaker even with the MS.\n\n>Also, it wasn't war that caused this event. This was Marada directly setting this up. This could have happened whether they were at war or not\n\nHe used the confusion in the middle of a war to bait a child. Why didn't he act sooner? He couldn't get the right opportunity because he was too weak, until Obito came. Even if we say Madara can manage to pick someone, why would he pick an average shinobi like Obito? He'd want to take someone really strong and naive, maybe a prodigy? So maybe Kakashi? idk.\n\n>there is plenty of opportunity for Obito to experience severe trauma that is just as bad as what he experiended in a full fledged war\n\nTrue.",
