                    "body": "I'd imagine it would be a significant reason for stopping his involvement on the show. He's done pretty much every thing he could do on this program. 11+ years for any variety show is a rarity and he's one of the few who's done it.\n\nGuy absolutely deserved to choose his acting career over variety. Or maybe the better phrasing would be \"diversifying\". I'd imagine he had more than a share of difficulties in picking roles outside of comedic ones due to his reputation as the zany member of Running Man. That and having to schedule his film/drama shoots around a variety shoot was probably a nightmare for his agency.\n\nSong Joong-Ki had the same exact point in his career, albeit it came about 10 years earlier than Kwang-Soo's did. Except Joong-Ki missed a ton of RM shoots and ended up (rightfully) choosing his acting career. Kwang-Soo on the other hand stuck with this show for as long as he could. I seriously thought he would be the next one gone right after Gary. Either him or Song Ji-Hyo. Keeping your schedule(s) open when you're an actor is **hard**. The fact that both have kept it solid for a decade is seriously unprecedented stuff. Honestly, what other variety mainstay, with this much popularity have kept duo roles? It's always been one or the other.\n\nI'm just glad nobody seems to be bitter about him choosing to leave. He earned it through and through.",

Does he remain on Running Man and continue to type-casted as a comedian or pursue a full-on acting career? I'm sure he struggled with it as we've all seen how talented he is as an actor. \n\nI'm not sure if he's embraced 'hybrid' status yet but I hope he does. He truly is a multi-talented entertainer and is one of a kind. He's been great in the roles he's played - even in serious dramas like Live. But he obviously also excels in his comedic roles and on variety shows.\n\nI'm sure his injury, his scheduling, and whatever else played factors in his departure in RM but I always felt that it was because he didn't want to risk being type-casted as 'the guy from RM/comedic guy' the rest of his career. He's a powerhouse on variety shows but also has top notch acting skills. \n\nGod, I miss LKS on RM but I am also happy for him. I hope he visits soon.",

He's done pretty much every thing he could do on this program. 11+ years for any variety show is a rarity and he's one of the few who's done it.\n\nGuy absolutely deserved to choose his acting career over variety. Or maybe the better phrasing would be \"diversifying\". I'd imagine he had more than a share of difficulties in picking roles outside of comedic ones due to his reputation as the zany member of Running Man. That and having to schedule his film/drama shoots around a variety shoot was probably a nightmare for his agency.\n\nSong Joong-Ki had the same exact point in his career, albeit it came about 10 years earlier than Kwang-Soo's did. Except Joong-Ki missed a ton of RM shoots and ended up (rightfully) choosing his acting career. Kwang-Soo on the other hand stuck with this show for as long as he could. I seriously thought he would be the next one gone right after Gary. Either him or Song Ji-Hyo. Keeping your schedule(s) open when you're an actor is **hard**. The fact that both have kept it solid for a decade is seriously unprecedented stuff. Honestly, what other variety mainstay, with this much popularity have kept duo roles? It's always been one or the other.\n\nI'm just glad nobody seems to be bitter about him choosing to leave. He earned it through and through.",
