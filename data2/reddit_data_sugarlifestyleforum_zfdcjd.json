    "body": "Lol I don\u2019t even know what to say. Keep in mind I\u2019m new to the sugar world.I met a a Pot SD a couple of weeks ago. Talked on the phone a few times. We went on M&G and everything was great, all green flags 100%. He offered a great ppm and allowance for my area. We scheduled a date right than and there for the following week, which was today. So I show up to the hotel, we talk for a bit, I\u2019m sitting on the bed when he get leans in trying to kiss me. I lean back and ask if he has a gift to give me before we start (ppm). Now this is where things take a turn \n\nWe went back and forth calmly for a good 10 minutes, felt long as hell. Him essentially saying he has been a SD for 15 years and never gives ppm first, giving money first is for hookers not SBs, I should trust him, he wants to tip and can\u2019t tip if he gives the agreed upon amount first, etc. refusing to give ppm before intimacy. \n\n\nI of course have done my research on sugar dating and have read many times to get your money first. So I wasn\u2019t going for it. How can I trust you when this is only my second time meeting you? So I just got up and started putting my shoes back on while he\u2019s in the bed. He reaches over to the candle on the bedside table, lifts it and flashes some money saying \u201csee I had your money\u201d. I told him take care and left. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what to think. I waxed (incredibly painful might I add) spent hours getting ready, planned my day around only to have my time absolutely wasted. Wow \n\nIs it normal to give ppm after? Like what percentage of you guys do that? Is that regular or is he the odd one out? Like why is giving ppm first such an issue? Is he worried I would run out of the room with they money???? He clearly had the money, what was his problem? \n\nI made a good call leaving right?",

There have been stories on here of that happening. However, it's his job to make sure you feel safe and comfortable on the date, and the calculus is that if you ripped him off, he'd be out the PPM. If he ripped you off, you'd be out the PPM (and can afford it less) as well as have given him sex, which you only consented to with the promise of the PPM. So, he's the one that needs to assume the risk.\n\nAlso:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>giving money first is for hookers and SBs, I should trust him, he wants to tip and can\u2019t tip if he gives the agreed upon amount first\n\nI've never heard of someone using \"tip\" in the context of an SR.

Actually she should not need to ask.  However, it is probably wise to cover the issue prior to arrival at the place of intended consummation.  \"For our first meeting I would feel better if we could get the financial stuff out of the way so we can fully enjoy our time.\"  \n\nIt is not an unreasonable request but also is best confirmed prior to the meeting.  Later on you can do whatever seems reasonable.  \n\nA final bit of preventive maintenance is to let the SB know that you will never decrease the amount without discussing it with her and so if the amount is not correct she would be doing you a favor by speaking up.",

As far as how PPM is usually handled, I need three hands to tell you.  On the one hand, in the wide world of sugar, SBs almost never ask for the PPM before sex (mostly because they're scared to), so it's handled after sex.   On the other hand, this is exactly why so many SBs get scammed, and why slf recommends you ask for it before sex.  On the third hand, given that it isn't the norm, I do always say that you should expect your SD to be a little surprised when you ask for it beforehand... *but he should still understand your concern and comply*.  I've never heard a story where the SD tried to guilt and shame an SB out of getting it beforehand, that ended well.   He gives it, or walk, is the suggestion.",

It's wining, dining, getting to know each other, him romancing her a bit, she seducing him a bit.  Yes, it's sugar, so financial support and sex are understood -- but that's not ALL there is, otherwise most of us don't think it's sugar.   And **especially** for the first date, there should be more than sex and money.\n\nIn most cases, even going to an SD's house for a date, is preceded by having dinner together out, or even him  cooking dinner, or some other effort to make this a date, not a sex appointment.  Speaking of which, the #1 reason the first date shouldn't be a \"go to the hotel for a sex date\" is... 100% of the time if that's the first date he designed, he's a john, and she's looking for an SD.",

I\u2019ve never seen a SB do that, but I have seen some put it in her purse, then go to the restroom before sex and I assume they check out the envelope to make sure.\n\nI have been robbed by a SB. She grabbed the PPM and ran. I did everything wrong and ignored every red flag (I was horny and stupid). As she took off my only thought was \u201cyeah, that seems about right\u201d. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that I provide the PPM first, only that I vet better.\n\nThere are a few reasons I provide the PPM first:\n\n1. You are putting a lot of trust in me to show up at a private place with a man you barely know. You are risking so much, I can risk losing a few hundred bucks.\n2. There is no better way to show you I\u2019m worthy of your trust. Once you see that I\u2019ve honored our deal you will relax. Knowing you are taken care of and with a man who will do what he says makes you more open to enjoy the sex, which is very good for me.\n3. I don\u2019t want you to have sex with me if you don\u2019t want to. I always tell a new SB that if she isn\u2019t 100% comfortable we will stop, at any point. I could see one girl was becoming overwhelmed during sex, I stopped and asked if she was okay, she wasn\u2019t. We stopped, got dressed, cuddled and talked and nothing more happened that day. But it did not effect her PPM, it isn\u2019t conditional. I never want a woman to regret having sex with me, or be traumatized in any way. (Fwiw: with that girl I assumed sugaring wasn\u2019t for her and we wouldn\u2019t meet again, but she was very persistent that she wanted another date, I agreed and she fucked my brains out, she just needed to know she was safe).",

If so, the few hundred dollars you may have missed out on wasn't worth the risk to your mental well being.

I\u2019ll never schedule a date with you again, but whether I got laid or not, the money was already given away in my mind. \n\nI\u2019ve never had someone grab it and go count it - always been trusted and that makes me glad. But if a SB wanted to go count, she could. Perhaps this is because I always gift a bit at the M&G - and a good little bit (~20-30% of PPM) if I really want to see them again. Establishing generosity before intimacy has probably already set them at ease. That is mission accomplished. \n\nI also always give more than we agreed to. Maybe just a very small amount more at times, but I\u2019m going to spoil with gifting, not pay for a service. \n\nI\u2019ve more than once had to remind someone of their gift as they were leaving.\n\nThere is more than one right way to do things, but the SD should take control and remove anxiety for the SB.

That language is such a red flag to me, I probably would've left if I were you.\n\n>I of course have done my research on sugar dating and have read many times to get your money first.\n\nI've been an SD for 5+ years. I think once ever in that time she asked for money first and was given it.\n\n>Is it normal to give ppm after? Like what percentage of you guys do that? \n\nIn my experience it's quite normal. Also in my experience it's *actually what is normal.* This forum disagrees, but it's not clear if it disagrees because of negative experiences of some SBs, political correctness, power dynamics, or that most people live in a different reality than I've experienced.\n\n>Is he worried I would run out of the room with they money????\n\nYes, and we've read that story here more than a few times. Also, I had a brief arrangement with a woman who admitted she had done this before. Also, I had a couple of \"not yet an arrangements\" where the money came from me before hand, went to her, and, well, she totally flew the coop.\n\n>I made a good call leaving right?\n\nIn my opinion, you did, despite what I wrote above. You were super uncomfortable and that's not a great way to start. Also, he was basically looking for an escort.",

However, it is probably wise to cover the issue prior to arrival at the place of intended consummation.  \"For our first meeting I would feel better if we could get the financial stuff out of the way so we can fully enjoy our time.\"  \n\nIt is not an unreasonable request but also is best confirmed prior to the meeting.  Later on you can do whatever seems reasonable.  \n\nA final bit of preventive maintenance is to let the SB know that you will never decrease the amount without discussing it with her and so if the amount is not correct she would be doing you a favor by speaking up.",

It's wining, dining, getting to know each other, him romancing her a bit, she seducing him a bit.  Yes, it's sugar, so financial support and sex are understood -- but that's not ALL there is, otherwise most of us don't think it's sugar.

Like any relationship -- e.g., if you were vanilla dating -- typically the first real date isn't \"show up to my place, have sex\".  It's wining, dining, getting to know each other, him romancing her a bit, she seducing him a bit.  Yes, it's sugar, so financial support and sex are understood -- but that's not ALL there is, otherwise most of us don't think it's sugar.   And **especially** for the first date, there should be more than sex and money.\n\nIn most cases, even going to an SD's house for a date, is preceded by having dinner together out, or even him  cooking dinner, or some other effort to make this a date, not a sex appointment.  Speaking of which, the #1 reason the first date shouldn't be a \"go to the hotel for a sex date\" is... 100% of the time if that's the first date he designed, he's a john, and she's looking for an SD.",
