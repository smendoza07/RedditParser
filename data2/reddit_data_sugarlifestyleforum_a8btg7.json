    "body": "Confirmation of your date with your SD for 6pm is made 48 hours prior to your date. You want to spend the next 2 days drinking only water and eating nonfat Greek yogurt. You give yourself a facial (or, if you\u2019re extra extravagant, you get one done). Maybe you re-dye your hair (or touch up any grays- for the older ladies). You most likely touch up your eyebrows. And you definitely do about 200 extra sit ups that night. \n\n24 hours pre date you exfoliate and slather on an entire bottle of whatever coconut-scented-parabin-free lotion is all the rage. You haven\u2019t eaten anything solid in an entire day. You spend an hour with cucumber slices on your eyes in an attempt to mask the circles you are developing from staying up all night doing sit ups, planks and squats. You debate eating the cucumber slices. You go to bed early with your body wrapped in a conditioning paste and your feet in aloe socks.\n\nMorning of the date you wake up at 4am. You shower, shave, and maybe condition your hair. You put on a moisturizer but don\u2019t do your makeup because you don\u2019t want to have to remove it and redo it before your date. You spend an hour blow drying and styling your hair. You pack a curling iron in your tote because you\u2019ll still need to touch it up after work. You have a clementine for breakfast. \n\nYou work 7-4. You sneak a piece of chocolate over lunch. You drink what feels like your 200th gallon of water. It\u2019s so cold in your office you spend the day with goosebumps and shivering, which means you\u2019ll have to shave your legs again before your date. \n\n4pm rolls around and you\u2019re still not able to leave work because Sally-Jo called off and you\u2019re stuck with her work, too. You contemplate quitting your job but don\u2019t think your SD wants to support your shoe habit AND your penchant for small batch wine. You power through and try not to complain too much about the extra work. \n\nAt 4:20 you cram yourself into your office\u2019s tiny private bathroom with your makeup bag. You plug in the curling iron but it shorts out the socket in the wall and the lights dim. You pack everything back up and head to the public bathroom that\u2019s used by everyone. You spread out your stuff and plug in your curling iron. A coworker gives you a grin and asks where you\u2019re going. You don\u2019t reply. There\u2019s someone in one of the stalls pooping. The bathroom smells like burnt brussel sprouts. You hope your skin only looks sallow because of the fluorescent lighting. You do your makeup but aren\u2019t able to finish because it\u2019s now 4:45 and your drive is 30 minutes without traffic. You shave your legs with your pants around your ankles and your foot on the toilet dispenser in the handicap stall. You lose your balance and almost fall into the toilet. You try quickly touching up your hair but your curling iron starts smoking because your hairspray bottle somehow leaked on it. The bathroom now smells like burnt hair. \n\nAt 5pm you get in your car. GPS tells you traffic into the city is gridlocked. You merge onto the highway while simultaneously applying eyeliner. You sit in traffic for over 45 minutes, attempting to finish doing your makeup and fending questions from your SD on whether you\u2019ll be on time. \n\nYou have plans to show up in an overcoat and nothing else. You know the hotel your meeting at doesn\u2019t have a public bathroom. You pull over a block away from the hotel at a dingy gas station. You ask the attendant for the key and he gives you the side eye because you don\u2019t buy anything. You balance precariously with one shoe on while stripping out of your clothes. You put your shoe on and take the other one off to finish removing the other pant leg. Bonus points are given for not touching the grey sticky floor with your bare feet. Your vriksasana needs work. You don\u2019t receive any bonus points and you\u2019re positive you now have hand-foot-and-mouth disease. \n\nYou decide you should clean up a bit. Dead stop traffic, a full days work and leather pants don\u2019t leave you feeling very fresh *down there*. You walk to the sink but find they don\u2019t have any paper towels, only a hand dryer. You stand with your lady parts under the hand dryer to dry everything off after cleaning up. You briefly wonder what the hand soap is going to taste like. You button up your jacket and hope the gas station attendant doesn\u2019t notice you came in wearing pants and are leaving without them. You make up a cover story about your monthly flow in your head but don\u2019t need to use it because he\u2019s busy with another customer. You inadvertently flash oncoming traffic getting into your suv. \n\nYou get to the hotel right on time. Your SD answers the door with a big kiss and flowers. You let him unbutton your coat and he laughs with excitement. By 7pm you\u2019re both laying satiated when your stomach starts to rumble. You wonder if the hotel left some mints on the pillow but the pillows are on the floor and your SD is snoring sprawled across your body pinning you down. By 8:30, when he finally wakes, you think you\u2019ll pass out from hunger. He mentions food and you throw on your clothing faster than he can get out of bed. \n\nAt dinner he chats about his children and you listen and nod. You eat only half the amount of food you truly want because no one looks cute with a full stomach. You only have one glass of wine because you can\u2019t orgasm when you\u2019re drunk. You definitely plan on getting naked again later. Your SD has more whiskey than he should to be able to function sexually, so later, he spends an hour pleasuring you. You love it. He falls asleep on top of you again and about 11pm your own eyes start to close.\n\nAt midnight when you\u2019re positive he\u2019s out for the night you walk to the bathroom and remove your makeup. You tie your hair up so it\u2019ll still look nice in the morning. You get back into bed and try to go back to sleep but your SD\u2019s snoring is waking you up every 30 minutes. By 2am you are hungry and contemplating the intricacies of your SR. Is it good for him? Does he truly value you? Is your allowance considered high or low? Is there a snack machine on this floor?\n\nYou fall asleep a little after 3:30 and wake up to your alarm at 5am. You thank your lucky stars the alarm didn\u2019t wake your guy.  You go back to the bathroom, clean up and put your makeup back on. You shave again, removing the remainder of your epidermis for the week. You lay back down and gently attempt to *rouse* your SD. At 6:15am you\u2019re putting on your jacket and wondering if you have enough time to go home and change before work. Instead of changing you stop at McDonalds, get three McGriddles and hope your coworkers don\u2019t realize you are wearing the same clothes as yesterday. At least your hair still looks nice.\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: This story is anecdotal. It is meant purely for your enjoyment. The characters used in this story are fictional(ish).
