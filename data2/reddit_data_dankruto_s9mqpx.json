I honestly think the only reason Hashirama was stronger was because of wood style.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a dumb explanation that the only reason he lost was because he was low on chakra. My man was one of the smartest shinobi. He could\u2019ve managed. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be bothered as much if they just showed the fight and how he died",

It\u2019s something he\u2019s had his entire life to grow accustomed to and accommodate for. \n\nSuddenly losing a massive part of your biology would hinder any seemingly basic tasks related to it. Like, take pouring a bowl of cereal for example. Super simple, doesn\u2019t take much effort. If the average person lost a huge chunk of their arms, they wouldn\u2019t be having cereal any time soon, but [it\u2019d be a laughing matter for someone used to that.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CGAqEhBnanj/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=718a34b6-1376-4c29-af57-d899324e6707&ig_mid=E0F5ACD1-B44D-4452-ADFE-EAB0AC0E3650) Likewise, having a huge chunk of your chakra pathway system suddenly drained would make simple tasks difficult, regardless of how much you had left. \n\nThat\u2019s how I see it, anyway. Lee can do it with little to no chakra because all of his training was with little to no chakra.",

We know this because actual physical strength has had almost no correlation with combat ability in the series, outside of outliers like Guy and Lee. Not to mention, Hinata is a practitioner of a combat style that is specifically designed to not require large amounts of force\u2014it's literally called \"The Gentle Fist\".\n\n>There were a few here and there actually but that just proves it wasn't because of men oppressing women.\n\n... Are you trying to say that the existence of exceptions to a given rule implies that the rule doesn't actually exist?\n\n>If women were as strong as men on average they would have had equal rights since the beginning of humanity.\n\nFun fact: there's historical data to suggest that early hunter-gatherer societies were far more egalitarian than most people assume, with men and women having equal status and say in how things were run; the power gap appears to have developed when they made the transition to settled agriculture, after which there was an incentive to accumulate resources and have more children, which men were naturally more suited to since they didn't have to deal with pregnancy or it's related issues. Strength is not always the determining factor of status within a society, early or modern.\n\n>Hinata is kind of a boring character but Sakura is actually one of the few well written female characters\n\nI agree that Hinata is boring, but I don't know how you can make the claim that Sakura is written well: her character arc is all over the place and almost entirely defined by her pining over the boy she liked as a 12 year old. Not to mention that despite her noteworthy accomplishments, the story never gives her much of a chance to show it off (with only one or two exceptions). The only well-written female characters with any significant amount of screentime are Tsunade and maybe Konan\u2014we don't really see enough of anyone else to judge the quality of their character writing.",

Was she a fangirl of her brother? I guess so.\n\nThe main reason I like her character is she was the only mother figure he had whereas he had Iruka, Kakashi, Jiraiya, and even Killer B as father figures.\n\nAre you saying you don't like her because she doesn't fight often?\n\nAs a kage, she shouldn't be fighting as much as the others. Naruto certainly doesn't in Boruto and Hiruzen didn't either.",

Have you not noticed how corrupt they are now?\n\nWhat does the supposed corruption of the news have to do with promoting the non-adherence to gender roles? And I'm not even talking about the news, I'm talking about the stuff that actually influences our culture: books, movies, television, etc.\n\n>It's honestly so patronizing and condescending to say women need to be told that there are other options.\n\nThis is a cop out, a call to emotion that ignores centuries of societal conditioning and inertia. Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",

I honestly think the only reason Hashirama was stronger was because of wood style.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a dumb explanation that the only reason he lost was because he was low on chakra. My man was one of the smartest shinobi. He could\u2019ve managed. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be bothered as much if they just showed the fight and how he died",

We know this because actual physical strength has had almost no correlation with combat ability in the series, outside of outliers like Guy and Lee. Not to mention, Hinata is a practitioner of a combat style that is specifically designed to not require large amounts of force\u2014it's literally called \"The Gentle Fist\".\n\n>There were a few here and there actually but that just proves it wasn't because of men oppressing women.\n\n... Are you trying to say that the existence of exceptions to a given rule implies that the rule doesn't actually exist?\n\n>If women were as strong as men on average they would have had equal rights since the beginning of humanity.\n\nFun fact: there's historical data to suggest that early hunter-gatherer societies were far more egalitarian than most people assume, with men and women having equal status and say in how things were run; the power gap appears to have developed when they made the transition to settled agriculture, after which there was an incentive to accumulate resources and have more children, which men were naturally more suited to since they didn't have to deal with pregnancy or it's related issues. Strength is not always the determining factor of status within a society, early or modern.\n\n>Hinata is kind of a boring character but Sakura is actually one of the few well written female characters\n\nI agree that Hinata is boring, but I don't know how you can make the claim that Sakura is written well: her character arc is all over the place and almost entirely defined by her pining over the boy she liked as a 12 year old. Not to mention that despite her noteworthy accomplishments, the story never gives her much of a chance to show it off (with only one or two exceptions). The only well-written female characters with any significant amount of screentime are Tsunade and maybe Konan\u2014we don't really see enough of anyone else to judge the quality of their character writing.",

I guess so.\n\nThe main reason I like her character is she was the only mother figure he had whereas he had Iruka, Kakashi, Jiraiya, and even Killer B as father figures.\n\nAre you saying you don't like her because she doesn't fight often?\n\nAs a kage, she shouldn't be fighting as much as the others.

Telling women that they have options is not the same as forcing it on them.\n\n>Recently some politicians have tried to require women to register for the draft and that absolutely needs to be stopped though.\n\nWhy? I understand if it's because you oppose the draft as a concept, but otherwise, why wouldn't you want any able-bodied individual to register? Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?",

And I'm not even talking about the news, I'm talking about the stuff that actually influences our culture: books, movies, television, etc.\n\n>It's honestly so patronizing and condescending to say women need to be told that there are other options.\n\nThis is a cop out, a call to emotion that ignores centuries of societal conditioning and inertia. Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",

I get it was the nine tails twins and several experienced shinobi, but Tobirama should\u2019ve been able to defeat them.\n\n The senju were giga strong and Tobirama was one of the best shinobi next to Hashirama. I honestly think the only reason Hashirama was stronger was because of wood style.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a dumb explanation that the only reason he lost was because he was low on chakra. My man was one of the smartest shinobi. He could\u2019ve managed. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be bothered as much if they just showed the fight and how he died",

It\u2019s something he\u2019s had his entire life to grow accustomed to and accommodate for. \n\nSuddenly losing a massive part of your biology would hinder any seemingly basic tasks related to it. Like, take pouring a bowl of cereal for example. Super simple, doesn\u2019t take much effort. If the average person lost a huge chunk of their arms, they wouldn\u2019t be having cereal any time soon, but [it\u2019d be a laughing matter for someone used to that.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CGAqEhBnanj/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=718a34b6-1376-4c29-af57-d899324e6707&ig_mid=E0F5ACD1-B44D-4452-ADFE-EAB0AC0E3650) Likewise, having a huge chunk of your chakra pathway system suddenly drained would make simple tasks difficult, regardless of how much you had left. \n\nThat\u2019s how I see it, anyway. Lee can do it with little to no chakra because all of his training was with little to no chakra.",

We know this because actual physical strength has had almost no correlation with combat ability in the series, outside of outliers like Guy and Lee. Not to mention, Hinata is a practitioner of a combat style that is specifically designed to not require large amounts of force\u2014it's literally called \"The Gentle Fist\".\n\n>There were a few here and there actually but that just proves it wasn't because of men oppressing women.\n\n... Are you trying to say that the existence of exceptions to a given rule implies that the rule doesn't actually exist?\n\n>If women were as strong as men on average they would have had equal rights since the beginning of humanity.\n\nFun fact: there's historical data to suggest that early hunter-gatherer societies were far more egalitarian than most people assume, with men and women having equal status and say in how things were run; the power gap appears to have developed when they made the transition to settled agriculture, after which there was an incentive to accumulate resources and have more children, which men were naturally more suited to since they didn't have to deal with pregnancy or it's related issues. Strength is not always the determining factor of status within a society, early or modern.\n\n>Hinata is kind of a boring character but Sakura is actually one of the few well written female characters\n\nI agree that Hinata is boring, but I don't know how you can make the claim that Sakura is written well: her character arc is all over the place and almost entirely defined by her pining over the boy she liked as a 12 year old. Not to mention that despite her noteworthy accomplishments, the story never gives her much of a chance to show it off (with only one or two exceptions). The only well-written female characters with any significant amount of screentime are Tsunade and maybe Konan\u2014we don't really see enough of anyone else to judge the quality of their character writing.",

Telling women that they have options is not the same as forcing it on them.\n\n>Recently some politicians have tried to require women to register for the draft and that absolutely needs to be stopped though.\n\nWhy? I understand if it's because you oppose the draft as a concept, but otherwise, why wouldn't you want any able-bodied individual to register? Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?",

Have you not noticed how corrupt they are now?\n\nWhat does the supposed corruption of the news have to do with promoting the non-adherence to gender roles? And I'm not even talking about the news, I'm talking about the stuff that actually influences our culture: books, movies, television, etc.\n\n>It's honestly so patronizing and condescending to say women need to be told that there are other options.\n\nThis is a cop out, a call to emotion that ignores centuries of societal conditioning and inertia. Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",

I get it was the nine tails twins and several experienced shinobi, but Tobirama should\u2019ve been able to defeat them.\n\n The senju were giga strong and Tobirama was one of the best shinobi next to Hashirama. I honestly think the only reason Hashirama was stronger was because of wood style.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a dumb explanation that the only reason he lost was because he was low on chakra. My man was one of the smartest shinobi. He could\u2019ve managed. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be bothered as much if they just showed the fight and how he died",

We know this because actual physical strength has had almost no correlation with combat ability in the series, outside of outliers like Guy and Lee. Not to mention, Hinata is a practitioner of a combat style that is specifically designed to not require large amounts of force\u2014it's literally called \"The Gentle Fist\".\n\n>There were a few here and there actually but that just proves it wasn't because of men oppressing women.\n\n... Are you trying to say that the existence of exceptions to a given rule implies that the rule doesn't actually exist?\n\n>If women were as strong as men on average they would have had equal rights since the beginning of humanity.\n\nFun fact: there's historical data to suggest that early hunter-gatherer societies were far more egalitarian than most people assume, with men and women having equal status and say in how things were run; the power gap appears to have developed when they made the transition to settled agriculture, after which there was an incentive to accumulate resources and have more children, which men were naturally more suited to since they didn't have to deal with pregnancy or it's related issues. Strength is not always the determining factor of status within a society, early or modern.\n\n>Hinata is kind of a boring character but Sakura is actually one of the few well written female characters\n\nI agree that Hinata is boring, but I don't know how you can make the claim that Sakura is written well: her character arc is all over the place and almost entirely defined by her pining over the boy she liked as a 12 year old. Not to mention that despite her noteworthy accomplishments, the story never gives her much of a chance to show it off (with only one or two exceptions). The only well-written female characters with any significant amount of screentime are Tsunade and maybe Konan\u2014we don't really see enough of anyone else to judge the quality of their character writing.",

Telling women that they have options is not the same as forcing it on them.\n\n>Recently some politicians have tried to require women to register for the draft and that absolutely needs to be stopped though.\n\nWhy? I understand if it's because you oppose the draft as a concept, but otherwise, why wouldn't you want any able-bodied individual to register? Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?",

Have you not noticed how corrupt they are now?\n\nWhat does the supposed corruption of the news have to do with promoting the non-adherence to gender roles? And I'm not even talking about the news, I'm talking about the stuff that actually influences our culture: books, movies, television, etc.\n\n>It's honestly so patronizing and condescending to say women need to be told that there are other options.\n\nThis is a cop out, a call to emotion that ignores centuries of societal conditioning and inertia. Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",

We know this because actual physical strength has had almost no correlation with combat ability in the series, outside of outliers like Guy and Lee. Not to mention, Hinata is a practitioner of a combat style that is specifically designed to not require large amounts of force\u2014it's literally called \"The Gentle Fist\".\n\n>There were a few here and there actually but that just proves it wasn't because of men oppressing women.\n\n... Are you trying to say that the existence of exceptions to a given rule implies that the rule doesn't actually exist?\n\n>If women were as strong as men on average they would have had equal rights since the beginning of humanity.\n\nFun fact: there's historical data to suggest that early hunter-gatherer societies were far more egalitarian than most people assume, with men and women having equal status and say in how things were run; the power gap appears to have developed when they made the transition to settled agriculture, after which there was an incentive to accumulate resources and have more children, which men were naturally more suited to since they didn't have to deal with pregnancy or it's related issues. Strength is not always the determining factor of status within a society, early or modern.\n\n>Hinata is kind of a boring character but Sakura is actually one of the few well written female characters\n\nI agree that Hinata is boring, but I don't know how you can make the claim that Sakura is written well: her character arc is all over the place and almost entirely defined by her pining over the boy she liked as a 12 year old. Not to mention that despite her noteworthy accomplishments, the story never gives her much of a chance to show it off (with only one or two exceptions). The only well-written female characters with any significant amount of screentime are Tsunade and maybe Konan\u2014we don't really see enough of anyone else to judge the quality of their character writing.",

Telling women that they have options is not the same as forcing it on them.\n\n>Recently some politicians have tried to require women to register for the draft and that absolutely needs to be stopped though.\n\nWhy? I understand if it's because you oppose the draft as a concept, but otherwise, why wouldn't you want any able-bodied individual to register? Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?",

Have you not noticed how corrupt they are now?\n\nWhat does the supposed corruption of the news have to do with promoting the non-adherence to gender roles? And I'm not even talking about the news, I'm talking about the stuff that actually influences our culture: books, movies, television, etc.\n\n>It's honestly so patronizing and condescending to say women need to be told that there are other options.\n\nThis is a cop out, a call to emotion that ignores centuries of societal conditioning and inertia. Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",

We know this because actual physical strength has had almost no correlation with combat ability in the series, outside of outliers like Guy and Lee. Not to mention, Hinata is a practitioner of a combat style that is specifically designed to not require large amounts of force\u2014it's literally called \"The Gentle Fist\".\n\n>There were a few here and there actually but that just proves it wasn't because of men oppressing women.\n\n... Are you trying to say that the existence of exceptions to a given rule implies that the rule doesn't actually exist?\n\n>If women were as strong as men on average they would have had equal rights since the beginning of humanity.\n\nFun fact: there's historical data to suggest that early hunter-gatherer societies were far more egalitarian than most people assume, with men and women having equal status and say in how things were run; the power gap appears to have developed when they made the transition to settled agriculture, after which there was an incentive to accumulate resources and have more children, which men were naturally more suited to since they didn't have to deal with pregnancy or it's related issues. Strength is not always the determining factor of status within a society, early or modern.\n\n>Hinata is kind of a boring character but Sakura is actually one of the few well written female characters\n\nI agree that Hinata is boring, but I don't know how you can make the claim that Sakura is written well: her character arc is all over the place and almost entirely defined by her pining over the boy she liked as a 12 year old. Not to mention that despite her noteworthy accomplishments, the story never gives her much of a chance to show it off (with only one or two exceptions). The only well-written female characters with any significant amount of screentime are Tsunade and maybe Konan\u2014we don't really see enough of anyone else to judge the quality of their character writing.",

Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",

Have you not noticed how corrupt they are now?\n\nWhat does the supposed corruption of the news have to do with promoting the non-adherence to gender roles? And I'm not even talking about the news, I'm talking about the stuff that actually influences our culture: books, movies, television, etc.\n\n>It's honestly so patronizing and condescending to say women need to be told that there are other options.\n\nThis is a cop out, a call to emotion that ignores centuries of societal conditioning and inertia. Both men and women need to understand that the traditional path for women shouldn't be set in stone, and there's plenty of them that don't understand that (arguably most of them, from a global perspective). This is especially true for developing countries that haven't progressed as far socially as most developed ones have. I cannot count the number of times I've seen women who wanted different things from their life be forced to give it all up to settle down and raise a family, or the number of times I've seen women who genuinely believe that their place is \"in the kitchen\", so to speak. And this is in my circles, in which people have an above average level of education and exposure to the world, people I generally thought were above that kind of thing until I learned otherwise\u2014it is orders of magnitude worse for most of my country. \n\nYou may be in better circumstances wherever you are, but thinking that a social effort is unnecessary just because you don't see the problem around you is a myopic position, born of a privileged experience not representative of the world at large.\n\n>The draft selects people at random and the average strength and stamina of women is lower than that of men.\n\nWhat about men who are below average in physical capabilities? By your logic, they should also be prevented from drafted, yes? If so, there's no reason to exclude women entirely: just have a certain set of criteria that must be met, and anyone who meets it would be drafted.\n\nAlso, did you not read my comment? This part specifically:\n\n>Even if you believe women aren't suited for frontline combat, there are a hundred other war-time operations that need staffing, so what logical reason would there be to artificially limit your selection pool?\n\nYou haven't answered that question yet.",
