            "body": "So Zoro getting lost again aside....hear me out.\n\nMadara would've made a better Kage than Hashirama.\n\nReasoning:\n\n\u2014Madara and Hashirama were near equal in strength/reputation.\n\n\u2014He's much shrewder and more tactically inclined than Hashirama, but not as paranoid and cynical about it as Tobirama.\n\n\u2014Prior to be \"betrayed\" by his clan and tricked by black zetsu (and later watching the world go to shit as he slowly aged and decayed), he was actually a pretty reasonable\u2014and arguably good\u2014dude. Probably somewhere between War Arc and Boruto Era Sasuke for comparison.\n\nWhat this means:\n\n\u2014Hashirama likely would've been one of his closest advisors and consults\u2014if not in an official capacity, then at least unofficially. (Think like Shikamaru and Sasuke are for Naruto.) This pretty much guarantees he'll rarely, if ever go TOO far \n\n\u2014He wasn't nearly as naive and trusting as Hashirama so he wouldn't hand out the bijuu like candy to make \"friends\". He'd definitely probably still capture them all though, meaning the full and unfiltered power of the 9 would belong solely to Konoha.\n\n\u2014He'd also be quick to use force to stop budding problems from growing into big problems. Although Hashi would totally force him to find peaceful solutions occasionally.\n\n\u2014Rather they appreciate him or not, he'd pretty much ensure his clan had a permanent place of prominence and purpose within the village. Plus him just being First Hokage in general would make the village as a whole view the Uchiha more favorably by default. These factors together would pretty much ensure the thought of rebellion never even crossed the Uchiha's mind unless extraneous circumstances happened.\n\n\u2014His respect for Hashirama would pretty much ensure he gave the Senju a similar seat of permanent power and prominence in the village.\n\n\u2014The 1st Shinobi War would play out very, very differently\u2014assuming there even was one in the first place. Worst case scenario, a pseudo Joint Shinobi Alliance would have to face off against Konoha proper at its absolute APEX, consisting of Madara, Hashirama, Tobirama, ALL 9 of the bijuu\u2014BEFORE sealing was a well known practice and Jinchuriki were unheard of\u2014, the Prime Uchiha, Senju, Sarutobi, Hyuuga, and more, ALL WHILE being backed up their sister clan/village the Uzumaki/Hidden Whirpool (which prior to its destruction, was strong enough to be considered the unofficial 6th great ninja village.)\n\nA more likely outcome though, is that that same overly stacked version of Konoha + the Uzumaki would've been fighting 2 to 4 different armies that were competing against each other as well.\n\nEither way, Konoha wins with varying degrees of difficulty, and has MASSIVE rewards to reap. (Territory annexation, destruction of rivals, passive migration of people and clans to the village, etc, etc..)\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nMadara would've been a damn good Hokage. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n\"What shall you do about the second one Onoki?\"~ A Fucking Legend.",
