    "body": "Use this reply to make him feel special, valued, appreciated, and that you\u2019re not with him ONLY for the money.\n\n\u201cI became a sugar baby for financial support, among other things. So money is definitely very important to me.\n\n\u201cBut I have standards and won\u2019t be with an SD who just give me lots of money. \n\n\u201cI only want to be with SD that I enjoy hanging out with. I've screened and rejected many POT who offers me lots of money but we don't match. I really enjoy spending time with you and I have been having a really great time with you. \n\n\u201cI really like that you... *&lt;Insert what you like about him, or what you have enjoyed. Give as specific details as possible. The more specific the better&gt;*\n\n*&lt;Praise him, boost his ego. Make him feel good about himself&gt;*\n\n*e.g I really like how you make me laugh. I really like that you always ask how I\u2019m doing. I really like that you make sure I finish first. I like that you have a hot body. I like that you have a very big cock. I like how you make me feel. yada yada*\n\n\"I love how we... *&lt;insert what you like about the SR.&gt;*\n\n*e.g. how we connected so well without feeling awkward. How we have so many mutual interest.*\n\n\u201cAnd I feel so lucky to have found you and have you as my SD. After reading all the horror stories about terrible SD, I\u2019m just so glad to be with you.\n\n\u201cSo no, I\u2019m NOT just seeing you for the money. Money is important to me, but so do the other things.\n\n*Then, if he\u2019s not that insecure or if you really need to drive home the point:*\n\n\"But financial support is my top most priority right now like what I\u2019ve mentioned  (And I won\u2019t see you without money, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re really asking.)\n\n=\n\nBTW if you\u2019re an SD, please don\u2019t ever ask this question. There\u2019s just no point to it, and will cause unnecessary discomfort to your SB",

It\u2019s like the SB asking, \u201cHow would you feel about financially supporting me if I no longer wanted to be intimate?\u201d I know that platonic SRs exist\u2014I quite accidentally found myself in one for a while\u2014but most SDs would politely decline, and would be justified in doing so. \n\nLikewise, most SBs would quickly take their leave if their SD suddenly stopped providing financial support, and pretending that isn\u2019t true is delusional at worst, and willfully ignorant at best. However, no SD wants to hear that, and none of us wants to *say* it. Of course I only choose SDs that I genuinely connect with, find attractive, enjoying spending time with and truly appreciate as people! I don\u2019t waste my time with anyone I don\u2019t actually like, so I\u2019m not *technically* just with them for financial support because I could also get that from many SDs I\u2019m not at all interested in. I always feel deeply for whomever I\u2019m seeing and care for them, on a personal level. I make sure to say this, often! What I don\u2019t want to say is, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not only with you for the money,\u201d because I feel it opens a can of worms that might quickly make a mess of everything. \n\nAny SD that asks a question like this is doing so to either have you stroke his ego, or use your answer against you as a weapon, down the line. If I say yes (which isn\u2019t true, but also isn\u2019t entirely untrue), I sound like a shallow bitch. If I say no, he might take advantage of that out of context and try to rope me into a vanilla relationship, when I absolutely didn\u2019t agree to ever doing such a thing. I make my terms and expectations clear from the M&G, and expect any SD to do the same without exception. I\u2019d quite frankly say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re even asking, babe. I thought we were on the same page regarding this SR. I feel as though a question like this sets me up to fail regardless of the answer, which is pretty unfair.\u201d\n\nEdit: all that said, if this question *is* asked and you *don\u2019t* mind answering it, I definitely agree that OP\u2019s example of how to respond is a good one! \n\nI wasn\u2019t at all trying to take away from that.",

Almost every SR will remain just that, a *sugar relationship,* until it ends. Transitions to vanilla relationships are uncommon. If anything, a SR transitioning to something \u201cmore serious\u201d will still involve financial support/gifts/trips etc., and the parties involved will become SBF/SGF. \n\nIf I \u201creally like\u201d my SD, is that a reason to stop being intimate? What if I decide I like him so much I\u2019d marry him, and say, \u201cnow that we\u2019re engaged I would like to save intimacy for our wedding night so it\u2019s *special*?\u201d Such an abrupt and extreme change would probably be unacceptable in the eyes of the SD. Same goes for financial support, in most cases.\n\nWhen the SR begins, terms and expectations from both sides should be thoroughly discussed and agreed to. Those terms should rarely be changed. In most cases, a change will mean more of something\u2014a higher allowance from the SD and more time/dates/intimacy from the SB, for example. Not less. I have a friend who is happily married to her SD. He financially supports them, she raises their son, *and* he still gives her a monthly allowance (that\u2019s quite generous).",

As I replied to on SD who seemed surprised I was looking for an allowance, \"Well, I'm on SA for a reason.\"\n\nDon't be so fucking thick. \n\nThe way I often respond to this question (which I agree is a ridiculous question to ask) is to say, \"Look, the money is really helpful, and it has helped make life much easier for me. But it's not ALL about the money. I do like you [for x, y, z, reasons] and love spending time with you, and the money helps me have a more comfortable lifestyle.\"\n\nBut really...don't ask SBs this question. You will either get your feelings hurt or lied to in some capacity.",

Okay. \n\nWe all want the complete package and we would like to think we are that to others, I get it. Feeling like someone only tolerates you is a bad feeling. Maybe if you feel like you have to ask that question there's actually other questions you need to ask more, because you're feeling something amiss in your relationship. Asking a pointed question like that is unproductive. What is making you feel only just tolerated? Are you not feeling like you have much to talk about, are you having trouble connecting emotionally? Is something troubling them and it is bleeding over into your time together? \n\nIt just seems like a very argumentative, immature question that requires an SB to manage your emotions rather than fixing anything. You're both still people, this is still a kind of relationship- you might need to communicate and work stuff out.",

Almost every SR will remain just that, a *sugar relationship,* until it ends. Transitions to vanilla relationships are uncommon. If anything, a SR transitioning to something \u201cmore serious\u201d will still involve financial support/gifts/trips etc., and the parties involved will become SBF/SGF. \n\nIf I \u201creally like\u201d my SD, is that a reason to stop being intimate? What if I decide I like him so much I\u2019d marry him, and say, \u201cnow that we\u2019re engaged I would like to save intimacy for our wedding night so it\u2019s *special*?\u201d Such an abrupt and extreme change would probably be unacceptable in the eyes of the SD. Same goes for financial support, in most cases.\n\nWhen the SR begins, terms and expectations from both sides should be thoroughly discussed and agreed to. Those terms should rarely be changed. In most cases, a change will mean more of something\u2014a higher allowance from the SD and more time/dates/intimacy from the SB, for example. Not less. I have a friend who is happily married to her SD. He financially supports them, she raises their son, *and* he still gives her a monthly allowance (that\u2019s quite generous).",

Almost every SR will remain just that, a *sugar relationship,* until it ends. Transitions to vanilla relationships are uncommon. If anything, a SR transitioning to something \u201cmore serious\u201d will still involve financial support/gifts/trips etc., and the parties involved will become SBF/SGF. \n\nIf I \u201creally like\u201d my SD, is that a reason to stop being intimate? What if I decide I like him so much I\u2019d marry him, and say, \u201cnow that we\u2019re engaged I would like to save intimacy for our wedding night so it\u2019s *special*?\u201d Such an abrupt and extreme change would probably be unacceptable in the eyes of the SD. Same goes for financial support, in most cases.\n\nWhen the SR begins, terms and expectations from both sides should be thoroughly discussed and agreed to. Those terms should rarely be changed. In most cases, a change will mean more of something\u2014a higher allowance from the SD and more time/dates/intimacy from the SB, for example. Not less. I have a friend who is happily married to her SD. He financially supports them, she raises their son, *and* he still gives her a monthly allowance (that\u2019s quite generous).",
