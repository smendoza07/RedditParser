    "body": "Over the last few days I've seen multiple posts from women that look like some version of:\n\n1. I have diagnosed mental illness, but haven't been to a therapist for some time, how can I find an SD?\n2. I got sick and gained a lot of weight, and haven't gone to the gym or dieted or anything, how can I find an SD?\n3. I have (racial characteristic X) and I refuse to tell you about anything interesting about me, how can I find an SD?\n\nNews flash: if you don't act as though you are valuable, it will be hard for other people to believe you are valuable.\n\nThere's an old joke: \"Pussy costs money; dick is free.\" And sure, that's true, but it doesn't mean that \\*your\\* pussy costs money. How much money have you spent on yourself lately? And if you don't have money, how much self-care? If you don't give a crap about yourself, why will some random stranger on the internet?\n\nI'm not saying you have to be a gym rat or in perfect health. But what can you do that makes you exciting and fun to be around? Your hobbies don't have to get you on TV, but maybe you are the best tequila drinker north of the border, or literally anything that could be considered a talking point.\n\nYou can't expect some older guy to sweep in and save you. Be the hero of your own life. If you're trying, but underwater, you will generate a lot more interest than if you aren't trying at all.",

You don't need a $300/month gym but rather the discipline to walk, run, dance, take free self defense instruction, bicycle etc.  For many if they devoted the time they waste on social media to exercise and reading they would be healthier and more interesting.",
