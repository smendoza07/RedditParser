A lot of people call sasuke a whiny person (putting it lightly) because he seems to hold so much resentment for no reason, but being one upped for your entire life just for your whole family to die to that same person who\u2019s always better than you is a completely unique experience. In some ways, sasuke\u2019s motivations were more logical than itachi\u2019s, although that may fall on itachi originally being a villain.",

And it did mess Sasuke up. He couldn't live without having a goal or working towards something fast and hard with constant action. The poor boy had no idea how to simply exist.\n\nI know Naruto wouldn't have any drama without the massacre but I feel for Sasuke because if he could be the kid who fed Naruto after the bell test when he had no reason to, shielded sakura from those mist chunin brothers and (more blatantly) took the needles for naruto in wave even when he said a team would drag him down, after watching his clan getting killed at 7 on repeat for 24-hours, he must be a really nice person underneath all the bluntness. i can see why naruto and sakura were obsessed with him.",

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc. It gives those moments more meaning, and I really appreciate small things like that.",

The only change we see is with shikamaru running the exam. However, the point here is that itachi took a test that was supposed to be more difficult than the level of those taking it, and finished it easily with no help. The same goes for minato. Even if the exam was somehow different for them (which it wasn\u2019t for itachi, since we see his test paper looks exactly like the ones naruto, sasuke, and the others used in their exam) passing such an exam by yourself so early is no small feat.",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Naruto and Sakura were the only persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

But that doesn't end up determining intelligence.\n\nEdit: also, questioning what you know is a good and necessary excercise to do!

And Hinata should have one of the best educations out of the rookie 9 as she was a heir. In a filler episode, it was shown that she had to learn a lot. In the DB, she also ranks pretty good in intelligence, but DB stats are inaccurate most of the time.

All the pain he caused, just because of his unchecked teenage emotions, doesn't excuse all the damage he caused. Forgiving Sasuke is understandable. Despite everything he *attempted* to do, the only thing Sasuke actually managed to do was kill Danzo, who was another cause of all the problems in Konoha. Even forgiving Orochimaru is hard to understand for me, because he killed the Kazekage, third Hokage, abducted children from all over to do his weird little experiments, and tried to steal Sasuke's body.\n\n\nNaruto has horrible judgement.",

I think she hesitated not because she was afraid, but because she *didn't want to*. Kishimoto is a shit writer for female characters, and he was absolutely inconsistent with Sakura. A medical ninja is not afraid to practice medicine. Sakura is not a coward. The only time she ever broke down truly is when (I think) Kabuto's genjutsu (that she was supposed to be skilled in detecting, remember? Cause Kishimoto sure didn't) made it look like Sasuke was pierced with shuriken and bleeding to death, back in the Forest of Death arc.\n\n\nHer only weakness is Sasuke. She didn't hesitate.

A lot of people call sasuke a whiny person (putting it lightly) because he seems to hold so much resentment for no reason, but being one upped for your entire life just for your whole family to die to that same person who\u2019s always better than you is a completely unique experience. In some ways, sasuke\u2019s motivations were more logical than itachi\u2019s, although that may fall on itachi originally being a villain.",

And it did mess Sasuke up. He couldn't live without having a goal or working towards something fast and hard with constant action. The poor boy had no idea how to simply exist.\n\nI know Naruto wouldn't have any drama without the massacre but I feel for Sasuke because if he could be the kid who fed Naruto after the bell test when he had no reason to, shielded sakura from those mist chunin brothers and (more blatantly) took the needles for naruto in wave even when he said a team would drag him down, after watching his clan getting killed at 7 on repeat for 24-hours, he must be a really nice person underneath all the bluntness. i can see why naruto and sakura were obsessed with him.",

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc. It gives those moments more meaning, and I really appreciate small things like that.",

The only change we see is with shikamaru running the exam. However, the point here is that itachi took a test that was supposed to be more difficult than the level of those taking it, and finished it easily with no help. The same goes for minato. Even if the exam was somehow different for them (which it wasn\u2019t for itachi, since we see his test paper looks exactly like the ones naruto, sasuke, and the others used in their exam) passing such an exam by yourself so early is no small feat.",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Naruto and Sakura were the only persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

But the problem with that, is that people tend to over-analyse characters just because they said something (what you\u2019re doing right now). But in reality, the writer just wanted to state a fact without the use of a narrator. \n\nWell, that\u2019s what I think, at least. I could be the one over-analysing or under-analysing.\n\nSo.. if sakura says that the questions are easy, it probably means that she\u2019s capable of answering them which means she\u2019s got to be pretty darn smart",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

But that doesn't end up determining intelligence.\n\nEdit: also, questioning what you know is a good and necessary excercise to do!

All the pain he caused, just because of his unchecked teenage emotions, doesn't excuse all the damage he caused. Forgiving Sasuke is understandable. Despite everything he *attempted* to do, the only thing Sasuke actually managed to do was kill Danzo, who was another cause of all the problems in Konoha. Even forgiving Orochimaru is hard to understand for me, because he killed the Kazekage, third Hokage, abducted children from all over to do his weird little experiments, and tried to steal Sasuke's body.\n\n\nNaruto has horrible judgement.",

Her role is to save Shinobi of the Allied Forces. Obito was not a Shinobi of the Allied Forces, in fact he started the War, and flip-flopped on his position once he realized he was nothing more than a tall child who was filled full of lies. Dead or alive, the eye can still be removed and transplanted to Kakashi, who already knows how to use it. \n\n\nThere was no need to save Obito. He should have died under that rock.",

And it did mess Sasuke up. He couldn't live without having a goal or working towards something fast and hard with constant action. The poor boy had no idea how to simply exist.\n\nI know Naruto wouldn't have any drama without the massacre but I feel for Sasuke because if he could be the kid who fed Naruto after the bell test when he had no reason to, shielded sakura from those mist chunin brothers and (more blatantly) took the needles for naruto in wave even when he said a team would drag him down, after watching his clan getting killed at 7 on repeat for 24-hours, he must be a really nice person underneath all the bluntness. i can see why naruto and sakura were obsessed with him.",

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc. It gives those moments more meaning, and I really appreciate small things like that.",

The only change we see is with shikamaru running the exam. However, the point here is that itachi took a test that was supposed to be more difficult than the level of those taking it, and finished it easily with no help. The same goes for minato. Even if the exam was somehow different for them (which it wasn\u2019t for itachi, since we see his test paper looks exactly like the ones naruto, sasuke, and the others used in their exam) passing such an exam by yourself so early is no small feat.",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

But that doesn't end up determining intelligence.\n\nEdit: also, questioning what you know is a good and necessary excercise to do!

And Hinata should have one of the best educations out of the rookie 9 as she was a heir. In a filler episode, it was shown that she had to learn a lot. In the DB, she also ranks pretty good in intelligence, but DB stats are inaccurate most of the time.

All the pain he caused, just because of his unchecked teenage emotions, doesn't excuse all the damage he caused. Forgiving Sasuke is understandable. Despite everything he *attempted* to do, the only thing Sasuke actually managed to do was kill Danzo, who was another cause of all the problems in Konoha. Even forgiving Orochimaru is hard to understand for me, because he killed the Kazekage, third Hokage, abducted children from all over to do his weird little experiments, and tried to steal Sasuke's body.\n\n\nNaruto has horrible judgement.",

And it did mess Sasuke up. He couldn't live without having a goal or working towards something fast and hard with constant action.

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc. It gives those moments more meaning, and I really appreciate small things like that.",

Even if one knew that you were supposed to cheat, it would only make you more fit to be a ninja, since the whole point of the written portion is testing surveillance skills. The only change we see is with shikamaru running the exam. However, the point here is that itachi took a test that was supposed to be more difficult than the level of those taking it, and finished it easily with no help. The same goes for minato. Even if the exam was somehow different for them (which it wasn\u2019t for itachi, since we see his test paper looks exactly like the ones naruto, sasuke, and the others used in their exam) passing such an exam by yourself so early is no small feat.",

Her chakra control is absolutely perfect and she got tree-walking right on the very first try. So maybe basic first-aid is okay, but teaching *everyone* a whole lot of medical jutsu is impossible\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: i forgot to mention. medical jutsu would also mean cramming over some bio lmao. sakura also seems to have a great memory and book smarts (like here, in the chunin exams for example) so she probably worked very, very hard and devoted her time to this. Others might like focusing on offense",

But the problem with that, is that people tend to over-analyse characters just because they said something (what you\u2019re doing right now). But in reality, the writer just wanted to state a fact without the use of a narrator. \n\nWell, that\u2019s what I think, at least. I could be the one over-analysing or under-analysing.\n\nSo.. if sakura says that the questions are easy, it probably means that she\u2019s capable of answering them which means she\u2019s got to be pretty darn smart",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

But that doesn't end up determining intelligence.\n\nEdit: also, questioning what you know is a good and necessary excercise to do!

In the DB, she also ranks pretty good in intelligence, but DB stats are inaccurate most of the time.

Also her douchecanoe of a father may have helped with destroying her self-worth in the first place.",

Despite everything he *attempted* to do, the only thing Sasuke actually managed to do was kill Danzo, who was another cause of all the problems in Konoha. Even forgiving Orochimaru is hard to understand for me, because he killed the Kazekage, third Hokage, abducted children from all over to do his weird little experiments, and tried to steal Sasuke's body.\n\n\nNaruto has horrible judgement.",

Dead or alive, the eye can still be removed and transplanted to Kakashi, who already knows how to use it. \n\n\nThere was no need to save Obito. He should have died under that rock.",

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc. It gives those moments more meaning, and I really appreciate small things like that.",

The only change we see is with shikamaru running the exam. However, the point here is that itachi took a test that was supposed to be more difficult than the level of those taking it, and finished it easily with no help. The same goes for minato. Even if the exam was somehow different for them (which it wasn\u2019t for itachi, since we see his test paper looks exactly like the ones naruto, sasuke, and the others used in their exam) passing such an exam by yourself so early is no small feat.",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

All the pain he caused, just because of his unchecked teenage emotions, doesn't excuse all the damage he caused. Forgiving Sasuke is understandable. Despite everything he *attempted* to do, the only thing Sasuke actually managed to do was kill Danzo, who was another cause of all the problems in Konoha. Even forgiving Orochimaru is hard to understand for me, because he killed the Kazekage, third Hokage, abducted children from all over to do his weird little experiments, and tried to steal Sasuke's body.\n\n\nNaruto has horrible judgement.",

And it did mess Sasuke up. He couldn't live without having a goal or working towards something fast and hard with constant action. The poor boy had no idea how to simply exist.\n\nI know Naruto wouldn't have any drama without the massacre but I feel for Sasuke because if he could be the kid who fed Naruto after the bell test when he had no reason to, shielded sakura from those mist chunin brothers and (more blatantly) took the needles for naruto in wave even when he said a team would drag him down, after watching his clan getting killed at 7 on repeat for 24-hours, he must be a really nice person underneath all the bluntness. i can see why naruto and sakura were obsessed with him.",

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc.

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

All the pain he caused, just because of his unchecked teenage emotions, doesn't excuse all the damage he caused. Forgiving Sasuke is understandable. Despite everything he *attempted* to do, the only thing Sasuke actually managed to do was kill Danzo, who was another cause of all the problems in Konoha. Even forgiving Orochimaru is hard to understand for me, because he killed the Kazekage, third Hokage, abducted children from all over to do his weird little experiments, and tried to steal Sasuke's body.\n\n\nNaruto has horrible judgement.",

With such a drastic event suddenly changing all aspects of life for sasuke, his only choice is to become fixated on a specific goal that\u2019s meant to bring him closure, which happened to be killing itachi since as an uchiha sasuke possesses a lot of hate, much more so after the massacre. All of this hate suddenly has nowhere to go when obito dumps on him that itachi was never at fault for what happened, so sasuke decides to redirect it at Konoha to avenge itachi, as a means to cope with how his life and purpose seem to be aimless now that itachi was never evil.\n\nBut team 7 is different from everyone else because they\u2019ve seen that sasuke has had previous willingness to give up the way hate and revenge controls his life. Even if it\u2019s a small chance, they want to bring back that sense of friendship which was able to fulfill sasuke in the time period where he was nowhere near strong enough to go after itachi. Power through orochimaru was just a more appealing option at that point.\n\nSasuke\u2019s still immature and irrational, but that\u2019s no reason to hate him when there\u2019s precedence for his actions and motivations. I do think there are better characters, however, and some of the choices made with sasuke\u2019s character could have been much better.",

However, with itachi it\u2019s more understandable since he has to play a part as a cold and emotionless villain, and an overall moral underlying motive guides him underneath that disguise, keeps him sane and determined. We\u2019ve also seen that itachi was traumatized early on with seeing how the third shinobi world war went down, probably causing him to lock away a lot of his emotions in order to focus on achieving his goals of peace. \n\nKakashi has less of an excuse in this situation, but he\u2019s similar to itachi in that he was also traumatized early on with Sakumo\u2019s death. However, I would also say that kakashi is the most emotionless character in the show, as itachi has shown emotion in things such as his speech to the uchiha police, his (fake) insanity when talking about the mangekyou during the sasuke fight, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s genius about making kakashi calm all the time, however, is that he becomes more of a complex character, open to the viewer\u2019s interpretation. You don\u2019t know what he might be thinking, or in the case of a new viewer, what he\u2019s gone through. It also emphasizes occasions where he does express emotion as important, such as kakashi smiling at naruto during the rasenshuriken training arc to show he has faith in his ability to surpass the fourth hokage, or kakashi\u2019s disbelief when he thought he saw minato, but in reality it was naruto\u2019s kcm2 cloak during the war arc. It gives those moments more meaning, and I really appreciate small things like that.",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

And at the same time, saying Sakura doesn't need to cheat, so that's how she will get the answers correct.\n\n3) Author shows us a bunch of people using different ninja abilities to cheat, including Neji's Byakugan.\n\n4) Author makes his way to the main character, Naruto, getting help from Hinata. \n\nYou) ~\"But we didn't see Hinata use her Byakugan so she must have answered them all on her own! So the questions must be pretty easy if Hinata can answer them too.\"\n\nResponse) ~\"I mean, maybe she didnt use her Byakugan. She probably DID use Byakugan, and there was no reason for us to see it twice since we saw Neji do it. But in the event that she didn't (because her personality is too timid to cheat), she also might have simply gotten the answers wrong. (Because the test is supposed to be too hard for even an above average person to answer). \n\nYou) ~\"But you can't say, in the event Hinata wrote her own answers, that she might have gotten them wrong. While at the same time you claim Sakura's are right, when we never got confirmation for either character!\"\n\nResponse) __No, that's not the point. The confirmation was given in step 1 and 2. The author told us Hinata cannot answer the questions, while Sakura can. He told us through Sakura's voice, so that's how you ended up over analyzing, because you're listening to Sakura as if she is fallibly over confidently saying something. In truth, she is being used to state a fact in replacement of a narrator saying it.__\n\nSo we can go back and forth on head canon all we want since you're right that nothing is explicitly confirmed, but it's very clear what the author's intention was here: Sakura is the only one shown that can answer the questions correctly without cheating. \n\nBiggest thing that's fairly up for debate is whether or not Hinata used Byakugan or simply tried her best and got incorrect answers. I would side with using Byakugan because she is still in a ninja exam and her timid personality isn't going to stop her from successfully completing \"the mission\".",

                    "body": "Just to add, i've read everything you've said and your argument does hold some merit, but it can be reasonably inferred that Hinata didn't cheat as well and i'd say she seemingly performed well too. \n1. It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",

It's confirmed on Narutopedia that she and Sakura were the only two persons who didn't cheat during the written exams. This is also supported by the fact that every single member of the Konoha 12 was shown to have been doing something during the test, be it cheating or working, with the author having her specifically sit beside Naruto and having the courage (albeit it's influenced by her crush) to offer to have him look, that must've meant something for her to be confident enough to have Naruto cheat from her paper knowing what's at stake. Thus, she likely was also doing well. \n2. Hinata is the first born of the Head of one of the most renowned clans in the whole show. In anime only episodes, it's been shown that from a tender age she's always had a strict and rigorous home schedule which included training and learning. So, it's pretty reasonable to say she's intelligent based on the demands of her upbringing and she therefore did well on the exam. \nI believe her intelligence is often overlooked, while on Team 8 Shino has the best analytical skills, she's always been shown to keep up easily and has always assessed situations well while on missions.",
