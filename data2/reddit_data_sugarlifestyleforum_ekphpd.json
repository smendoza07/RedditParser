    "body": "I got called a cheap hooker today because I didn\u2019t want to send a random man from the site a photo of my spread rear end for $50. All I could do is report him. \n\nStay safe ladies, and stand up for yourself. I took a collage app and made a collage to send with my report to SA so that they had plenty of info.\n\nEdit: collages help because SA only allows us one photo per report. Get them all the info you can.",

I didn\u2019t expect it at all, we had dinner, and I was in a SR with him for a little. \n\nI think a lot of people do it as a full time job so they may come off as desperate for money. I drive for LYFT and do other stuff so I\u2019m honestly more focused on finding a long term connection who I can count on to invest in me. \n\nIt\u2019s sooo hard in Southern California though where everyone treats each other as if they\u2019re so disposable it seems.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m actually house sitting for a guy I met on the site and he\u2019s paying me for it which is pretty cool because he knows I need the help and I get along with his adorable kitty whenever I come hangout !",

So that\u2019s why I asked for gas money if he wanted me to drop what I was doing to go hangout or meet up.\n\nI was saying he would need to pay for my gas if he wanted me to come at the moment he desired. Everything else was still being discussed",

I had one guy who actually brought me a chocolate bar and a card and it was SO SWEET! I didn\u2019t expect it at all, we had dinner, and I was in a SR with him for a little. \n\nI think a lot of people do it as a full time job so they may come off as desperate for money. I drive for LYFT and do other stuff so I\u2019m honestly more focused on finding a long term connection who I can count on to invest in me. \n\nIt\u2019s sooo hard in Southern California though where everyone treats each other as if they\u2019re so disposable it seems.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m actually house sitting for a guy I met on the site and he\u2019s paying me for it which is pretty cool because he knows I need the help and I get along with his adorable kitty whenever I come hangout !",
