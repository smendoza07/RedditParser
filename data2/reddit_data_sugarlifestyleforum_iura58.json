    "body": "I really just wanted to get this off my chest as I can't talk to anyone IRL bout it, feel bit shitty but ok as had a nice m&g today! \n\nm&g the other evening and he was very PDA from half an hour in. I feel sexually harassed really, he firstly came back from the bathroom and went in for a kiss in a very public outdoor terraced bar. (I then said how extreme pda makes me uncomfortable in any vanilla or sugar situation) Then it was his hand under my dress trying to touch my <area> constantly and full on grabbing my boob when we moved to a different spot inside. Again me repeatedly saying no please don't. And he's 'jokingly' still trying to grab my boobs ! \nThen there's him boasting about his money, job, investments and designer clothes, then had the audacity to haggle the arrangement price lower when it wasn't high to begin with.  \nThankfully he hasnt even tried to text me so thats a relief really.\nThanks for reading if you got this far \ud83d\ude02 just wanted to vent.",

IMO that wasn't just harassment -- he sexually assaulted you, repeatedly.\n\nI know it's easy to wonder \"why didn't she just get up and leave?\" but when it actually happens, sometimes victims are too nice or in shock or feeling threatened or other reasons why they want to leave or run but are unable to. \n\nThere are resources for people who have been assaulted, if you want additional people to talk to, to get support, help with pressing charges, etc. \n\ne.g. [https://www.rainn.org/about-national-sexual-assault-telephone-hotline](https://www.rainn.org/about-national-sexual-assault-telephone-hotline) has a phone number and a link to an online chat where you can talk to someone about it. Other resources here ([https://www.nsvrc.org/what-you-can-do](https://www.nsvrc.org/what-you-can-do)). \n\nAlso, I'm just listing those if you want them, obviously it's up to you on how you want to proceed.",

You're boasting about your fortune but you are so narcissistic that you think people won't notice your actions, which indicate money is scarce and you're already basically telling someone that they dont value you.\n\nWith the haggling I always go, \"That is how myself and others value me. I've never even had someone ever try to barter my value lower before. So you're saying you don't think I'm worth what I and others think I'm worth? Money must be very scarce for you if you are saying you cant afford it from the get go. Are you always trying to barter down? Do you do that with your dentist, massage therapist, cab driver? Then why are you doing that with me?\"",
