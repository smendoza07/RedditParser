Imagine the ridiculous chakra contortions just to write something down using two different puppet suits. \n\nAnd how does he even see? His main puppet is disassembled and reassembled during his fight with Sakura, so I don't suppose his puppet eyes are necessary for him to sense his surroundings. And his fleshy core lacks eyes altogether.",

For example, if the plate is made out of pure silver, which has a mohs hardness of ~2.5, a blade made out of pure iron would be able scratch it because it is has a mohs hardness of 4.5. But most practical uses of metal involve metal alloys, such as steel. In producing a practical steel blade or plate, you would need to anneal the metal by heating it to make it more ductile so you can shape it into your desired object. Once it's cooled, it will maintain its shape but wouldn't be fully hardened. A final step to harden the alloy is by quenching the metal, through heating it to a red hot phase and quickly submerging it in water. This allows all the molecules to line up in a rigid formation ro create hardened steel. So the head plate could be steel that hadn't gone through the quenching process, giving it a hardness of 4-4.5, and blades/knifes are always hardned because they wouldn't last very long if they werent, and hardened steel has a hardness of 7-8, which should be very effective at scratching the unhardened steel plate.",

Does a villain need to be terrifying for a arc to be good? \n\nProbably ur opinion but I don't see how villian not being terrifying makes the arc bad in any way. One piece is supposed to be freesprited beginning of an adventure. U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

It's just others are better in comparison to Alabasta and east blue saga. \n\nThose were classic golds and just got overshadowed by goats like ennies lobby and marineford. \n\nOne piece gets better by each arc as we get to know the world better but it doesn't mean earlier arcs were shit. I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline.

No spoilers here, but Oda is a HUGE fan of having big, winding story threads intertwine with each other and take time to pay off/wrap up, sometimes over multiple arcs. Now I'm not saying that every single line and every single minor interaction is some super important detail, but if there is a moment or episode where you say \"huh, that wasn't super entertaining, kinda boring even, wonder why it was there\", chances are it's Oda laying a foundational puzzle piece for something later.\n\nAre there filler episodes? Yes. Are there episodes chock-full of flashbacks and callbacks and do they, ultimately, not say much? Yes. But imagine if the whole \"Itachi killed everyone and Sasuke just hates that\" storyline had a lot more detail, minor involved characters, and was spread out over an arc or two instead of just being a piece of Sasuke backstory you learn at the top of the show. If you actually got to watch the lead up to it all, saw the act, got to move with Sasuke past it, and then an arc or so later, he starts at ninja middle school and meets Sakura and Naruto. That's what One Piece does, to a degree. Instead of having characters explain what happened to them prior to Trying To Get That Dang One Piece, that's the entire show.\n\nAgain, no spoilers here, but there might be arcs or storylines you aren't super invested in (for example, my partner and I didn't much care for the Skypeia Arc), but they're still always worth a watch for wacky antics,  decent fight scenes, and plenty of fodder for everyone's favorite argument game \"Which super power would you rather have, A or B?\" and \"Who would win in a fight, A or B?\"",

It starts a lot slower than Naruto but it's definitely worth it. The long-term storytelling and world-building are definitely what set One Piece apart.

                            "body": "What I really like in One Piece is the worldbuilding and the long-term narrative.\n\nNaruto has good worldbuilding (especially historical lore) but you always feel that there is a lot more that could have been covered and it feels like there are large gaps in the timeline that could be filled up. Like Kishimoto skates over the Ninja World Wars and while we do get some depth to them through some of the characters involved at the end of the day there is just so much we don't know. Like yeah seeing how Obito and Nagato reacted to the Wars was very interesting but I'd also like to know why the War started, who sided with who, why did they pick those sides, etc. I don't think Kishimoto realizes the problems he opens up when he introduces these massive events and then only focuses on facets of it.\n\nMeanwhile, with One Piece, Oda is a lot more careful with his planning. When Oda introduces something 90% of the time you get a satisfying explanation for it and the 10% is stuff that you know will be answered later in the future because Oda won't forget about it. On several occasions, Oda will introduce something and give it sufficient depth and then hundreds of chapters later circle back to it and connect it with the current predicament which only serves to enhance the whole thing. Also, the physical worldbuilding of One Piece is just unparalleled. Like he might be the most physically creative writer I've seen. That is something that immediately stuck out in One Piece to me. Kishimoto is pretty good with his aesthetic, especially with areas like the Hidden Rain but it's really not even close.\n\nLong-term narrative is an area where I absolutely adore One Piece. The bigger picture feels planned and Oda is great at pacing himself. Things are foreshadowed a lot better. Even in the arcs, I don't care much for, I still get excited to see the seeds planted for arcs that are to 3-4 years down the lines and Oda does a great job of bringing your attention to it as something to look out for. It makes things more exciting to revisit as well as gives you stuff to look forward to. With Kishimoto, it seems that he has ideas for the future but he doesn't do the best job of laying down the structure for them. I mean take the War, especially the later stages. Stuff like Indra vs Ashura had been introduced way earlier in the story but because Kishimoto didn't really emphasize it, it never felt like something we had to look forward to. So when he reintroduces it, instead of feeling like foreshadowing is being paid off it feels awkward and stilted.",

The story just starts goofy because it's a gaggle of teens and preteens with superpowers dreaming of being pirate royalty; a goofy premise indeed. For a fake example, if there's a villain who uses bunny-shaped bombs to blow up empty boats and spray confetti everywhere, there might be some wacky hijinks to stop them, but if there's a villain kidnapping and killing children to harvest their organs, it's all straight faces and to-the-point dialogue with action to match. (Hopefully I don't sound too fangirl-y when I say this) Oda has a masterful control over the emotional state of the story, meaning he knows when to lay on the drama and keep you biting your nails and when to allow the audience to relax, unwind, and process what's happened. It ebbs and flows, it breathes, and works best when you just go along for the ride.",

Multitude of characters; all of which are used very well, and a fun cast. If people get too stuck onto the artstyle and characters designs, then they miss out on the good storytelling that One Piece has, which although it looks goody and silly can get very serious, is cohesive and consistent in its writing quality, and can tackle some heavy handed things rather well.  \n\nAlthough that is a common complaint about One Piece, it's artstyle and character designs put people off, which is a shame in my opinion. \n\nIn addition, it moves at a slow pace, and some people may not be willing to watch 130 episodes before they feel invested. However, if someone was willing to give it a trial run, if they feel nothing for the story by the time they're in episode 110, they should probably just drop the series because it is obviously not for them. If they're willing to watch till the end of the arc (130) then they make the decisions whether to continue or not. People say to watch up to episode 44 (as that's where many people get hooked onto the series), but I feel like 130 should be the make or break, as by then, probably all the good qualities of One Piece writing has been covered (so far).",

The powers are definitely more creative and I have to commend Oda for sticking to a consistent power ceiling but overall no fights in One Piece ever challenged Naruto for me. Not to say the fights are bad because they're still decent and you do get some really hype power-ups but they tend to be the part of the arc that I enjoy the least.\n\nFor me, One Piece's strength lies in its worldbuilding and storytelling. Oda introduces so many unique ideas and fleshed them out well. You very rarely have unanswered questions and when you do it just means Oda will tell you later on. Also, One Piece is definitely a more planned story than Naruto. Within the current arc Oda has the propensity to plant the seeds for arcs 3-4 years into the future.\n\nCharacters are something I feel I hold the minority opinion on. I prefer the Naruto characters to the One Piece characters. Now the One Piece characters are good and the main cast does have a lot of depth but they feel secondary to the plot. The only time Oda is willing to focus on them is if the plot dictates it. Meanwhile, Kishimoto uses his characters to form the plot. It basically comes down to me preferring a character-driven story over a plot-driven story.",

I got through over 100 chapters within a few weeks and I was completely hooked on and was anticipating every page turn. Anyway what I\u2019m saying is if you like the premise during the East Blue saga, you\u2019ll most likely love whats to come.",

Obviously you've seen other people talk about fights and world building, but I think One Piece is great because of the range of emotions and characters you get over Naruto, since it is much more of an adventure than Naruto constantly at war. They get to explore and meet people, so situations feel newer.\n\nPersonally I prefer Naruto pre time skip over shippuden and I would say that is more similar to one piece.\n\nNot too hate on Naruto, but it feels much more the story of Naruto(hence the name and all), than One Piece feels the story of Luffy.

Again just my opinion.\n\nMy bad, I misinterpreted. But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

I literally watched 2 dudes pushing each other for solid 4 minutes, recycling and repeating the scenes at least 5 times each. Since anime caught up to the manga they dragged that shiet out so much it became a noodle. Half of the page of the manga shouldn't be stretched to 5 minutes. They seem to have fixed this nowadays so it's fine\n\n\nAbout manga itself, I don't know that much but I have nothing but respect for that inhumane imagination of Oda.",

When people say an arc of Naruto was bad, they mean it (and often they mean the end of the war which is a shame because it's the end of the manga) or they talk about the anime and yes the anime is very very slow but I don't mind that.\n\nNaruto was absolutely great until Pain, it's an action manga which became a little bit too much centered about powers toward the end and a lot of people gave up because of the war and the story becoming a little bit weird (and some people I know stopped way before Kaguya so they probably would say something worse if they continued)\n\nIn One Piece, it's all about lore, stories and characters and Oda doesn't fear to skip an entire fight that we would have love to see just because it's not important to the plot. If you're here for the fighting, sure you'll get your fights, but it's not a fighting manga, it's an adventure manga similar to what Dragon Ball was before Piccolo and it's absolutely NORMAL to not like it.",

Legit just finished binging all of them. \n\nThe way Naruto treated his son, is as heartbreaking as Kurama\u2019s death. When Boruto fought Hinata\u2019s little sister at his grandpa\u2019s home to prove to his father that he has Byakugan in his right eye, Naruto looked at him the same way people in the Village did when he was thirteen. He defended STRANGERS for that at 16. But looks at his son knowing full well what he\u2019s doing?! And he spends more time making TV appearances for daytime talk shows than he does with his family. He even had the audacity to say \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a father because I never had one.\u201d Wasn\u2019t Iruka sensei the one who Naruto personally picked to fill the role of the father for Naruto and Hinata\u2019s wedding? He\u2019s smart enough to understand that the way he helped Gaara is how to be s dad to his only son. No wonder Boruto doesn\u2019t want to become Hokage. Boruto\u2019s pissed because he knows this fact: no one\u2019s ever too busy. If someone WANTS to make time for you, they will. Despite that, he went out of his way to earn his father\u2019s approval. You know, those cases he and his friends did? I watched Naruto grow up in real time. It\u2019s soul crushing he grew up this way. I hate the new director so much. Sorry for ranting. I\u2019m just really annoyed about that.",

For example, if the plate is made out of pure silver, which has a mohs hardness of ~2.5, a blade made out of pure iron would be able scratch it because it is has a mohs hardness of 4.5. But most practical uses of metal involve metal alloys, such as steel. In producing a practical steel blade or plate, you would need to anneal the metal by heating it to make it more ductile so you can shape it into your desired object. Once it's cooled, it will maintain its shape but wouldn't be fully hardened. A final step to harden the alloy is by quenching the metal, through heating it to a red hot phase and quickly submerging it in water. This allows all the molecules to line up in a rigid formation ro create hardened steel. So the head plate could be steel that hadn't gone through the quenching process, giving it a hardness of 4-4.5, and blades/knifes are always hardned because they wouldn't last very long if they werent, and hardened steel has a hardness of 7-8, which should be very effective at scratching the unhardened steel plate.",

Does a villain need to be terrifying for a arc to be good? \n\nProbably ur opinion but I don't see how villian not being terrifying makes the arc bad in any way. One piece is supposed to be freesprited beginning of an adventure. U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

It's just others are better in comparison to Alabasta and east blue saga. \n\nThose were classic golds and just got overshadowed by goats like ennies lobby and marineford. \n\nOne piece gets better by each arc as we get to know the world better but it doesn't mean earlier arcs were shit. I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline. But arc in itself was cool. \n\nU would also love crocodile if u like terrifying villains.",

It\u2019s so frustrating to watch a main character that\u2019s in his late teens make worse decisions than actual 4-year olds. \n\n\nBrook is pretty cool at thriller bark, but for some reason after the time skip, he\u2019s more cowardly than Usopp. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s so many of these small frustrating things that make one piece less than what it should be. \n\n\nAnd the thing that annoys me the most is the animation. \n\n\nThe animations are so extremely lazy it\u2019s hard to watch sometimes. Like some episodes literally feels like just 20 still pictures with mouths moving. \n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be 700+ episodes in if I didn\u2019t like it, but god damn..\n\n\nSorry had to vent.",

No spoilers here, but Oda is a HUGE fan of having big, winding story threads intertwine with each other and take time to pay off/wrap up, sometimes over multiple arcs. Now I'm not saying that every single line and every single minor interaction is some super important detail, but if there is a moment or episode where you say \"huh, that wasn't super entertaining, kinda boring even, wonder why it was there\", chances are it's Oda laying a foundational puzzle piece for something later.\n\nAre there filler episodes? Yes. Are there episodes chock-full of flashbacks and callbacks and do they, ultimately, not say much? Yes. But imagine if the whole \"Itachi killed everyone and Sasuke just hates that\" storyline had a lot more detail, minor involved characters, and was spread out over an arc or two instead of just being a piece of Sasuke backstory you learn at the top of the show. If you actually got to watch the lead up to it all, saw the act, got to move with Sasuke past it, and then an arc or so later, he starts at ninja middle school and meets Sakura and Naruto. That's what One Piece does, to a degree. Instead of having characters explain what happened to them prior to Trying To Get That Dang One Piece, that's the entire show.\n\nAgain, no spoilers here, but there might be arcs or storylines you aren't super invested in (for example, my partner and I didn't much care for the Skypeia Arc), but they're still always worth a watch for wacky antics,  decent fight scenes, and plenty of fodder for everyone's favorite argument game \"Which super power would you rather have, A or B?\" and \"Who would win in a fight, A or B?\"",

                    "body": "What I really like in One Piece is the worldbuilding and the long-term narrative.\n\nNaruto has good worldbuilding (especially historical lore) but you always feel that there is a lot more that could have been covered and it feels like there are large gaps in the timeline that could be filled up. Like Kishimoto skates over the Ninja World Wars and while we do get some depth to them through some of the characters involved at the end of the day there is just so much we don't know. Like yeah seeing how Obito and Nagato reacted to the Wars was very interesting but I'd also like to know why the War started, who sided with who, why did they pick those sides, etc. I don't think Kishimoto realizes the problems he opens up when he introduces these massive events and then only focuses on facets of it.\n\nMeanwhile, with One Piece, Oda is a lot more careful with his planning. When Oda introduces something 90% of the time you get a satisfying explanation for it and the 10% is stuff that you know will be answered later in the future because Oda won't forget about it. On several occasions, Oda will introduce something and give it sufficient depth and then hundreds of chapters later circle back to it and connect it with the current predicament which only serves to enhance the whole thing. Also, the physical worldbuilding of One Piece is just unparalleled. Like he might be the most physically creative writer I've seen. That is something that immediately stuck out in One Piece to me. Kishimoto is pretty good with his aesthetic, especially with areas like the Hidden Rain but it's really not even close.\n\nLong-term narrative is an area where I absolutely adore One Piece. The bigger picture feels planned and Oda is great at pacing himself. Things are foreshadowed a lot better. Even in the arcs, I don't care much for, I still get excited to see the seeds planted for arcs that are to 3-4 years down the lines and Oda does a great job of bringing your attention to it as something to look out for. It makes things more exciting to revisit as well as gives you stuff to look forward to. With Kishimoto, it seems that he has ideas for the future but he doesn't do the best job of laying down the structure for them. I mean take the War, especially the later stages. Stuff like Indra vs Ashura had been introduced way earlier in the story but because Kishimoto didn't really emphasize it, it never felt like something we had to look forward to. So when he reintroduces it, instead of feeling like foreshadowing is being paid off it feels awkward and stilted.",

The story just starts goofy because it's a gaggle of teens and preteens with superpowers dreaming of being pirate royalty; a goofy premise indeed. For a fake example, if there's a villain who uses bunny-shaped bombs to blow up empty boats and spray confetti everywhere, there might be some wacky hijinks to stop them, but if there's a villain kidnapping and killing children to harvest their organs, it's all straight faces and to-the-point dialogue with action to match. (Hopefully I don't sound too fangirl-y when I say this) Oda has a masterful control over the emotional state of the story, meaning he knows when to lay on the drama and keep you biting your nails and when to allow the audience to relax, unwind, and process what's happened. It ebbs and flows, it breathes, and works best when you just go along for the ride.",

Multitude of characters; all of which are used very well, and a fun cast. If people get too stuck onto the artstyle and characters designs, then they miss out on the good storytelling that One Piece has, which although it looks goody and silly can get very serious, is cohesive and consistent in its writing quality, and can tackle some heavy handed things rather well.  \n\nAlthough that is a common complaint about One Piece, it's artstyle and character designs put people off, which is a shame in my opinion. \n\nIn addition, it moves at a slow pace, and some people may not be willing to watch 130 episodes before they feel invested. However, if someone was willing to give it a trial run, if they feel nothing for the story by the time they're in episode 110, they should probably just drop the series because it is obviously not for them. If they're willing to watch till the end of the arc (130) then they make the decisions whether to continue or not. People say to watch up to episode 44 (as that's where many people get hooked onto the series), but I feel like 130 should be the make or break, as by then, probably all the good qualities of One Piece writing has been covered (so far).",

The powers are definitely more creative and I have to commend Oda for sticking to a consistent power ceiling but overall no fights in One Piece ever challenged Naruto for me. Not to say the fights are bad because they're still decent and you do get some really hype power-ups but they tend to be the part of the arc that I enjoy the least.\n\nFor me, One Piece's strength lies in its worldbuilding and storytelling. Oda introduces so many unique ideas and fleshed them out well. You very rarely have unanswered questions and when you do it just means Oda will tell you later on. Also, One Piece is definitely a more planned story than Naruto. Within the current arc Oda has the propensity to plant the seeds for arcs 3-4 years into the future.\n\nCharacters are something I feel I hold the minority opinion on. I prefer the Naruto characters to the One Piece characters. Now the One Piece characters are good and the main cast does have a lot of depth but they feel secondary to the plot. The only time Oda is willing to focus on them is if the plot dictates it. Meanwhile, Kishimoto uses his characters to form the plot. It basically comes down to me preferring a character-driven story over a plot-driven story.",

They get to explore and meet people, so situations feel newer.\n\nPersonally I prefer Naruto pre time skip over shippuden and I would say that is more similar to one piece.\n\nNot too hate on Naruto, but it feels much more the story of Naruto(hence the name and all), than One Piece feels the story of Luffy.

One Piece has its flaws too but that part wasnt about it. if we want to talk about One Piece flaws we could talk about idk how its not realistic when it comes to killing characters while Naruto is much more consistent\n\nit kind of does, thats semantics. its not that they are badly written as in wrong, its lazy writing. they usually have no depth and are very one dimensional, again, Tsunade being an important exception. Oda has problematic female character designs but imo the writing has been solid",

Again just my opinion.\n\nMy bad, I misinterpreted. But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

There were times I straight up thought his crew was about to die and I didn\u2019t know how the show would continue. It\u2019s the best story I\u2019ve seen in an anime, and it has amazing character development which is what had me hooked. You learn to love all of the characters. It\u2019s a great journey",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

When people say an arc of Naruto was bad, they mean it (and often they mean the end of the war which is a shame because it's the end of the manga) or they talk about the anime and yes the anime is very very slow but I don't mind that.\n\nNaruto was absolutely great until Pain, it's an action manga which became a little bit too much centered about powers toward the end and a lot of people gave up because of the war and the story becoming a little bit weird (and some people I know stopped way before Kaguya so they probably would say something worse if they continued)\n\nIn One Piece, it's all about lore, stories and characters and Oda doesn't fear to skip an entire fight that we would have love to see just because it's not important to the plot. If you're here for the fighting, sure you'll get your fights, but it's not a fighting manga, it's an adventure manga similar to what Dragon Ball was before Piccolo and it's absolutely NORMAL to not like it.",

Sanji arc was cool but nothing as great as naruto's arcs. Ik one piece will get better but the arcs you mentioned are honestly average arcs. Wtf was that Wapol arc, worse than naruto filler. Pacing is kinda slow too. Albasta arc is slow af.",

Does a villain need to be terrifying for a arc to be good? \n\nProbably ur opinion but I don't see how villian not being terrifying makes the arc bad in any way. One piece is supposed to be freesprited beginning of an adventure. U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

It's just others are better in comparison to Alabasta and east blue saga. \n\nThose were classic golds and just got overshadowed by goats like ennies lobby and marineford. \n\nOne piece gets better by each arc as we get to know the world better but it doesn't mean earlier arcs were shit. I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline. But arc in itself was cool. \n\nU would also love crocodile if u like terrifying villains.",

                            "body": "An important thing to keep in mind with One Piece is that if something seems irrelevant, it most likely isn't. No spoilers here, but Oda is a HUGE fan of having big, winding story threads intertwine with each other and take time to pay off/wrap up, sometimes over multiple arcs. Now I'm not saying that every single line and every single minor interaction is some super important detail, but if there is a moment or episode where you say \"huh, that wasn't super entertaining, kinda boring even, wonder why it was there\", chances are it's Oda laying a foundational puzzle piece for something later.\n\nAre there filler episodes? Yes. Are there episodes chock-full of flashbacks and callbacks and do they, ultimately, not say much? Yes. But imagine if the whole \"Itachi killed everyone and Sasuke just hates that\" storyline had a lot more detail, minor involved characters, and was spread out over an arc or two instead of just being a piece of Sasuke backstory you learn at the top of the show. If you actually got to watch the lead up to it all, saw the act, got to move with Sasuke past it, and then an arc or so later, he starts at ninja middle school and meets Sakura and Naruto. That's what One Piece does, to a degree. Instead of having characters explain what happened to them prior to Trying To Get That Dang One Piece, that's the entire show.\n\nAgain, no spoilers here, but there might be arcs or storylines you aren't super invested in (for example, my partner and I didn't much care for the Skypeia Arc), but they're still always worth a watch for wacky antics,  decent fight scenes, and plenty of fodder for everyone's favorite argument game \"Which super power would you rather have, A or B?\" and \"Who would win in a fight, A or B?\"",

            "body": "What I really like in One Piece is the worldbuilding and the long-term narrative.\n\nNaruto has good worldbuilding (especially historical lore) but you always feel that there is a lot more that could have been covered and it feels like there are large gaps in the timeline that could be filled up. Like Kishimoto skates over the Ninja World Wars and while we do get some depth to them through some of the characters involved at the end of the day there is just so much we don't know. Like yeah seeing how Obito and Nagato reacted to the Wars was very interesting but I'd also like to know why the War started, who sided with who, why did they pick those sides, etc. I don't think Kishimoto realizes the problems he opens up when he introduces these massive events and then only focuses on facets of it.\n\nMeanwhile, with One Piece, Oda is a lot more careful with his planning. When Oda introduces something 90% of the time you get a satisfying explanation for it and the 10% is stuff that you know will be answered later in the future because Oda won't forget about it. On several occasions, Oda will introduce something and give it sufficient depth and then hundreds of chapters later circle back to it and connect it with the current predicament which only serves to enhance the whole thing. Also, the physical worldbuilding of One Piece is just unparalleled. Like he might be the most physically creative writer I've seen. That is something that immediately stuck out in One Piece to me. Kishimoto is pretty good with his aesthetic, especially with areas like the Hidden Rain but it's really not even close.\n\nLong-term narrative is an area where I absolutely adore One Piece. The bigger picture feels planned and Oda is great at pacing himself. Things are foreshadowed a lot better. Even in the arcs, I don't care much for, I still get excited to see the seeds planted for arcs that are to 3-4 years down the lines and Oda does a great job of bringing your attention to it as something to look out for. It makes things more exciting to revisit as well as gives you stuff to look forward to. With Kishimoto, it seems that he has ideas for the future but he doesn't do the best job of laying down the structure for them. I mean take the War, especially the later stages. Stuff like Indra vs Ashura had been introduced way earlier in the story but because Kishimoto didn't really emphasize it, it never felt like something we had to look forward to. So when he reintroduces it, instead of feeling like foreshadowing is being paid off it feels awkward and stilted.",

The story just starts goofy because it's a gaggle of teens and preteens with superpowers dreaming of being pirate royalty; a goofy premise indeed. For a fake example, if there's a villain who uses bunny-shaped bombs to blow up empty boats and spray confetti everywhere, there might be some wacky hijinks to stop them, but if there's a villain kidnapping and killing children to harvest their organs, it's all straight faces and to-the-point dialogue with action to match. (Hopefully I don't sound too fangirl-y when I say this) Oda has a masterful control over the emotional state of the story, meaning he knows when to lay on the drama and keep you biting your nails and when to allow the audience to relax, unwind, and process what's happened. It ebbs and flows, it breathes, and works best when you just go along for the ride.",

Multitude of characters; all of which are used very well, and a fun cast. If people get too stuck onto the artstyle and characters designs, then they miss out on the good storytelling that One Piece has, which although it looks goody and silly can get very serious, is cohesive and consistent in its writing quality, and can tackle some heavy handed things rather well.  \n\nAlthough that is a common complaint about One Piece, it's artstyle and character designs put people off, which is a shame in my opinion. \n\nIn addition, it moves at a slow pace, and some people may not be willing to watch 130 episodes before they feel invested. However, if someone was willing to give it a trial run, if they feel nothing for the story by the time they're in episode 110, they should probably just drop the series because it is obviously not for them. If they're willing to watch till the end of the arc (130) then they make the decisions whether to continue or not. People say to watch up to episode 44 (as that's where many people get hooked onto the series), but I feel like 130 should be the make or break, as by then, probably all the good qualities of One Piece writing has been covered (so far).",

The powers are definitely more creative and I have to commend Oda for sticking to a consistent power ceiling but overall no fights in One Piece ever challenged Naruto for me. Not to say the fights are bad because they're still decent and you do get some really hype power-ups but they tend to be the part of the arc that I enjoy the least.\n\nFor me, One Piece's strength lies in its worldbuilding and storytelling. Oda introduces so many unique ideas and fleshed them out well. You very rarely have unanswered questions and when you do it just means Oda will tell you later on. Also, One Piece is definitely a more planned story than Naruto. Within the current arc Oda has the propensity to plant the seeds for arcs 3-4 years into the future.\n\nCharacters are something I feel I hold the minority opinion on. I prefer the Naruto characters to the One Piece characters. Now the One Piece characters are good and the main cast does have a lot of depth but they feel secondary to the plot. The only time Oda is willing to focus on them is if the plot dictates it. Meanwhile, Kishimoto uses his characters to form the plot. It basically comes down to me preferring a character-driven story over a plot-driven story.",

They get to explore and meet people, so situations feel newer.\n\nPersonally I prefer Naruto pre time skip over shippuden and I would say that is more similar to one piece.\n\nNot too hate on Naruto, but it feels much more the story of Naruto(hence the name and all), than One Piece feels the story of Luffy.

I'm allowed to think differently of the story without hearing \"if you dont see it i think its because you dont want to see it\".\n\nAlso, \"not well-written\" doesn't mean \"badly written\". Hinata isn't a well-written character but I wouldn't say she's a badly-written character either. And if we're talking about problematic female writing Oda really isn't much better than Kishimoto.",

One Piece has its flaws too but that part wasnt about it. if we want to talk about One Piece flaws we could talk about idk how its not realistic when it comes to killing characters while Naruto is much more consistent\n\nit kind of does, thats semantics. its not that they are badly written as in wrong, its lazy writing. they usually have no depth and are very one dimensional, again, Tsunade being an important exception. Oda has problematic female character designs but imo the writing has been solid",

Again just my opinion.\n\nMy bad, I misinterpreted. But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

I literally watched 2 dudes pushing each other for solid 4 minutes, recycling and repeating the scenes at least 5 times each. Since anime caught up to the manga they dragged that shiet out so much it became a noodle. Half of the page of the manga shouldn't be stretched to 5 minutes. They seem to have fixed this nowadays so it's fine\n\n\nAbout manga itself, I don't know that much but I have nothing but respect for that inhumane imagination of Oda.",

When people say an arc of Naruto was bad, they mean it (and often they mean the end of the war which is a shame because it's the end of the manga) or they talk about the anime and yes the anime is very very slow but I don't mind that.\n\nNaruto was absolutely great until Pain, it's an action manga which became a little bit too much centered about powers toward the end and a lot of people gave up because of the war and the story becoming a little bit weird (and some people I know stopped way before Kaguya so they probably would say something worse if they continued)\n\nIn One Piece, it's all about lore, stories and characters and Oda doesn't fear to skip an entire fight that we would have love to see just because it's not important to the plot. If you're here for the fighting, sure you'll get your fights, but it's not a fighting manga, it's an adventure manga similar to what Dragon Ball was before Piccolo and it's absolutely NORMAL to not like it.",

If you don't enjoy One Piece by the time your in Alabasta, it's probably not a series for you. Of course, that's over 100 episodes in, and some would rather not dedicate their time to that for a series they may not enjoy.",

Does a villain need to be terrifying for a arc to be good? \n\nProbably ur opinion but I don't see how villian not being terrifying makes the arc bad in any way. One piece is supposed to be freesprited beginning of an adventure. U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

It's just others are better in comparison to Alabasta and east blue saga. \n\nThose were classic golds and just got overshadowed by goats like ennies lobby and marineford. \n\nOne piece gets better by each arc as we get to know the world better but it doesn't mean earlier arcs were shit. I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline. But arc in itself was cool. \n\nU would also love crocodile if u like terrifying villains.",

                    "body": "An important thing to keep in mind with One Piece is that if something seems irrelevant, it most likely isn't. No spoilers here, but Oda is a HUGE fan of having big, winding story threads intertwine with each other and take time to pay off/wrap up, sometimes over multiple arcs. Now I'm not saying that every single line and every single minor interaction is some super important detail, but if there is a moment or episode where you say \"huh, that wasn't super entertaining, kinda boring even, wonder why it was there\", chances are it's Oda laying a foundational puzzle piece for something later.\n\nAre there filler episodes? Yes. Are there episodes chock-full of flashbacks and callbacks and do they, ultimately, not say much? Yes. But imagine if the whole \"Itachi killed everyone and Sasuke just hates that\" storyline had a lot more detail, minor involved characters, and was spread out over an arc or two instead of just being a piece of Sasuke backstory you learn at the top of the show. If you actually got to watch the lead up to it all, saw the act, got to move with Sasuke past it, and then an arc or so later, he starts at ninja middle school and meets Sakura and Naruto. That's what One Piece does, to a degree. Instead of having characters explain what happened to them prior to Trying To Get That Dang One Piece, that's the entire show.\n\nAgain, no spoilers here, but there might be arcs or storylines you aren't super invested in (for example, my partner and I didn't much care for the Skypeia Arc), but they're still always worth a watch for wacky antics,  decent fight scenes, and plenty of fodder for everyone's favorite argument game \"Which super power would you rather have, A or B?\" and \"Who would win in a fight, A or B?\"",

The story just starts goofy because it's a gaggle of teens and preteens with superpowers dreaming of being pirate royalty; a goofy premise indeed.

(Hopefully I don't sound too fangirl-y when I say this) Oda has a masterful control over the emotional state of the story, meaning he knows when to lay on the drama and keep you biting your nails and when to allow the audience to relax, unwind, and process what's happened.

One Piece has its flaws too but that part wasnt about it. if we want to talk about One Piece flaws we could talk about idk how its not realistic when it comes to killing characters while Naruto is much more consistent\n\nit kind of does, thats semantics. its not that they are badly written as in wrong, its lazy writing. they usually have no depth and are very one dimensional, again, Tsunade being an important exception. Oda has problematic female character designs but imo the writing has been solid",

Again just my opinion.\n\nMy bad, I misinterpreted. But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

When people say an arc of Naruto was bad, they mean it (and often they mean the end of the war which is a shame because it's the end of the manga) or they talk about the anime and yes the anime is very very slow but I don't mind that.\n\nNaruto was absolutely great until Pain, it's an action manga which became a little bit too much centered about powers toward the end and a lot of people gave up because of the war and the story becoming a little bit weird (and some people I know stopped way before Kaguya so they probably would say something worse if they continued)\n\nIn One Piece, it's all about lore, stories and characters and Oda doesn't fear to skip an entire fight that we would have love to see just because it's not important to the plot. If you're here for the fighting, sure you'll get your fights, but it's not a fighting manga, it's an adventure manga similar to what Dragon Ball was before Piccolo and it's absolutely NORMAL to not like it.",

U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

It's just others are better in comparison to Alabasta and east blue saga. \n\nThose were classic golds and just got overshadowed by goats like ennies lobby and marineford. \n\nOne piece gets better by each arc as we get to know the world better but it doesn't mean earlier arcs were shit. I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline.

            "body": "An important thing to keep in mind with One Piece is that if something seems irrelevant, it most likely isn't. No spoilers here, but Oda is a HUGE fan of having big, winding story threads intertwine with each other and take time to pay off/wrap up, sometimes over multiple arcs. Now I'm not saying that every single line and every single minor interaction is some super important detail, but if there is a moment or episode where you say \"huh, that wasn't super entertaining, kinda boring even, wonder why it was there\", chances are it's Oda laying a foundational puzzle piece for something later.\n\nAre there filler episodes? Yes. Are there episodes chock-full of flashbacks and callbacks and do they, ultimately, not say much? Yes. But imagine if the whole \"Itachi killed everyone and Sasuke just hates that\" storyline had a lot more detail, minor involved characters, and was spread out over an arc or two instead of just being a piece of Sasuke backstory you learn at the top of the show. If you actually got to watch the lead up to it all, saw the act, got to move with Sasuke past it, and then an arc or so later, he starts at ninja middle school and meets Sakura and Naruto. That's what One Piece does, to a degree. Instead of having characters explain what happened to them prior to Trying To Get That Dang One Piece, that's the entire show.\n\nAgain, no spoilers here, but there might be arcs or storylines you aren't super invested in (for example, my partner and I didn't much care for the Skypeia Arc), but they're still always worth a watch for wacky antics,  decent fight scenes, and plenty of fodder for everyone's favorite argument game \"Which super power would you rather have, A or B?\" and \"Who would win in a fight, A or B?\"",

The story just starts goofy because it's a gaggle of teens and preteens with superpowers dreaming of being pirate royalty; a goofy premise indeed. For a fake example, if there's a villain who uses bunny-shaped bombs to blow up empty boats and spray confetti everywhere, there might be some wacky hijinks to stop them, but if there's a villain kidnapping and killing children to harvest their organs, it's all straight faces and to-the-point dialogue with action to match. (Hopefully I don't sound too fangirl-y when I say this) Oda has a masterful control over the emotional state of the story, meaning he knows when to lay on the drama and keep you biting your nails and when to allow the audience to relax, unwind, and process what's happened. It ebbs and flows, it breathes, and works best when you just go along for the ride.",

IMO Kishimoto did better than Oda when it came to character writing.\n\nYou're coming across as very defensive of One Piece. I read One Piece too my guy. I'm allowed to think differently of the story without hearing \"if you dont see it i think its because you dont want to see it\".\n\nAlso, \"not well-written\" doesn't mean \"badly written\". Hinata isn't a well-written character but I wouldn't say she's a badly-written character either. And if we're talking about problematic female writing Oda really isn't much better than Kishimoto.",

One Piece has its flaws too but that part wasnt about it. if we want to talk about One Piece flaws we could talk about idk how its not realistic when it comes to killing characters while Naruto is much more consistent\n\nit kind of does, thats semantics. its not that they are badly written as in wrong, its lazy writing. they usually have no depth and are very one dimensional, again, Tsunade being an important exception. Oda has problematic female character designs but imo the writing has been solid",

Again just my opinion.\n\nMy bad, I misinterpreted. But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

Does a villain need to be terrifying for a arc to be good? \n\nProbably ur opinion but I don't see how villian not being terrifying makes the arc bad in any way. One piece is supposed to be freesprited beginning of an adventure. U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

It's just others are better in comparison to Alabasta and east blue saga. \n\nThose were classic golds and just got overshadowed by goats like ennies lobby and marineford. \n\nOne piece gets better by each arc as we get to know the world better but it doesn't mean earlier arcs were shit. I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline.

They were set up in Naruto, the threat is real so even though they are not three dimensional masterpieces of an antagonist they do the job. The criticism that it get boring is truly solid, but with the later episodes I don't think it is the case. Although obliously that is my opinion.",

One Piece has its flaws too but that part wasnt about it. if we want to talk about One Piece flaws we could talk about idk how its not realistic when it comes to killing characters while Naruto is much more consistent\n\nit kind of does, thats semantics. its not that they are badly written as in wrong, its lazy writing. they usually have no depth and are very one dimensional, again, Tsunade being an important exception. Oda has problematic female character designs but imo the writing has been solid",

But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline. But arc in itself was cool. \n\nU would also love crocodile if u like terrifying villains.",

But I' don't think I'm being defensive of Naruto. In fact, the parent comment is about me underappreciating Naruto after having read One Piece.\n\nI'll agree Kishimoto's template is very lazy (because he basically subscribes to traditional gender roles) and Oda does a better job in that aspect by giving them more independent goals. But when I say problematic it's something else. The designs really don't bother me much, Oda sexualizes characters but that's common for the genre. Kishimoto is the exception and even he indulges to a degree. I'm talking about other stuff. I think Thriller Bark is a good example here. Nami gets sexually assaulted in the shower, then gets drugged and disrobed, and an unconscious Nami is to be forcibly married to the sexual assaulter. And the entire situation is played for laughs. I was hoping when Sanji came he would point out how disgusting the situation was but instead, he's basically complaining that he couldn't do that. That's a pretty fucked up moral of the story. Like I get perv humor is a big thing in Japan but that's way over the line and it's also when Sanji's character started to degrade for me.",

The characters all have their moments, but in stereotypical anime fashion they all have a personality quirk that dominates everything they say, and it can get grating. One yells a lot, one likes fighting, one is shy, etc. It can be endearing at times, but to me it came off as lazy at best and annoying at worst.\n\nCharacter development is also okay. Some get it more than others. Not as many characters get development as in, say, One Piece, and those that do get development don't get as much of it as would the best characters from Naruto. It's about in the middle. The main character is mostly a flat character arc.\n\nStory is well paced. You might have heard this next criticism before, and it'll make instant sense upon watching the first couple episodes, but the show really does feel like a Naruto clone. At the very least it feels like it was explicitly made to be a replacement for Naruto.",

U can't just throw anyone when they are just picking up basic crew. \n\nAnd u here talking about pacing when hiruzen was hanging on Orochimaru's sword for whole ass year. \n\n\nU somehow pulled wapol here when it never happened in first 100 episodes to somehow trash op. Lol u know about half of first 100 episodes are filler and 20-30 about  hiruzen taking his last breath? \n\nAlso we never reached ababasta infirst 100.\n\nArlong was cool enough villan and better than zabuza at least. Mihawk's presence was also great. \n\nIf u pull alabasta here then crocodile was much much better and terrifying villain than anyone we say in half of Naruto.\n\n(*u don't have to nitpick reasons to say u don't like it. U can just u didn't like it. If u bring something foolish as that then someone will surely come and say that's not the case.)",

I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline.

I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline.

I don't who told u that but I assure, no one feels that way on one piece sub. \n\nLogue town and baratie were cool as well imo. \n\nIf u take east blue as something where luffy gets his first crewmate (and 5 main protagonists of op story) rather than luffy fighting strong villains then u would love it more. \n\nEast blue villains are fodder in comparison to what u are about to see in grandline. But arc in itself was cool. \n\nU would also love crocodile if u like terrifying villains.",
