    "body": "... is fucking fantastic. I feel like I\u2019ve uncovered some great secret. Why have I been wasting my time with 25-year-olds who I have to directly ask to reciprocate oral (and am often denied!) - when there is a 59-year-old man who pauses intercourse every 3 minutes to go down on me? And the skill level. Holy shit. 40 years of experience really pays off!\n \nCredit where credit is due. I tip my hat to you, old dudes of the sugar bowl! Y\u2019all really know wassup.",

This has happened not once but twice with (different) younger SBs (my sweet spot is mid-20s). After maybe 2nd or 3rd intimate date...we've had a lovely dinner and maybe some other fun activity out...then back at the hotel, I've played her for hours...slowly up to the edge--then back again--up to the edge, back again--then OVER THE EDGE! Lather, rinse, repeat until she'd lost track of orgasms, time, the cosmos...  I hopped up to use the can, and come back to the bedroom to find her sobbing--WTF?? \"Oh My God...no one's EVER made me feel like that...so amazing...and you've done that with me every time we've done it...and you're fucking PAYING me!!!\" Just doin' my job, M'am.",

I've since learned that if I can please a woman she will please me 5x.  Most women I've been with don't want to have to tell me what to do, they want me to know what to do!
