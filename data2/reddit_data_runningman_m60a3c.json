    "body": "A large-scale promotional project has kicked off to promote 200 Korean actors globally. \n\nThe Korean Film Council has joined forces with the actors and photographers to launch the promotional campaign. \n\nThe 200 actors, 100 men and 100 women, were chosen based on their box office performance and the contribution they made to Korean films over the past decade. First, the council will produce a book in English that contains the actors\u2019 photos and stories and hand out copies of the book to those involved with the Cannes, Berlin, and Venice film festivals, as well as global OTT producers. \n\nThe council is also creating \u201cMoving Trailers\u201d that each show an actor\u2019s filmography and release them on their website for global film industry people and audiences to see.\n\nCongratulations to our talented actors kwang soo & jihyo \ud83d\ude0e",
