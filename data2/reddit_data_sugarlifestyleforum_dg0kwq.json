    "body": "A few weeks ago I recieved a message on seeking from this gorgeous SD. Heart throb good looking. I'm sure most of you have read my past posts. I'm a plus size SB, 35 years old and have 3 kids. Along with stretch marks, a c-section scar and a tummy. Not ideal SB material at all, but that's all ok because I'm just me. Anyway, I still thought to myself there is no way this guy is going to be interested in me. After a few messages were exchanged, he asked if I had time to meet up that day. I did, and we met.  He is even hotter in person, Italian, chiseled, smelled incredible. The meet was fantastic. We clicked, laughed, I was comfortable. We went to a waterfall and during the walk he held my hand, and then asked if it was ok if he kissed me. That kiss, omfg.  \n\nWe have seen each other twice since then. Most recent was yesterday. And the first time we had sex. I was terrified  for him to see me naked. Long story short, it was incredible. After, we were laying there talking about how much fun we have together, and the possibilities of what else we will do together, different things we can explore. The next thing I know he is staring at me, , playing with my hair and said you're beautiful, do you know that ? So, there I was, laying next to this incredible man, the type of man I never think will look my way and he is telling me I'm beautiful.  Is this real life ? These moments are worth all the crap we all go through. I don't have the type of success a younger perfect 10 has but yesterday confirmed , once again, that I am an incredible woman and there are many things about me that are desirable to SD's and men in general. Not that validation from men or any one matters, you have to believe that you are awesome on your own.  The confidence boost is an amazing high, I'm still on cloud nine. My point is, if you are struggling in anything, life, the bowl, work, etc your monents will come, even if they are few and far between, you will still be blown away and glad you didn't give up. I know some people say well that's all nice but it's unrealistic to make it sound like everyone will have these experiences in the bowl.  Fair enough but coming from someone who doesn't fit the typical SB bill, it sure is happening to me. It's been said a million times, but confidence is key, always.",

            "body": "I can't quantify it, but in my opinion, many women undervalue their appearance.\n\nI once had an SB who billed herself as \"Curvy\" which can mean almost anything.   She too had the C-section scar, which she used as a tattoo platform for lots of flowers....I called it her garden (and I loved paying a visit to her garden).   She was cute, but not classically 'beautiful'.  But, OMG, she was awesome and the sex was insane.   She met a guy in vanilla world or we would still be a sugar couple.   I often looked at her and thought...she has no idea how hot she is.\n\nOn the flip side, I've met many women in the bowl who took great pictures and considered themselves to be hot...but they were luke warm at best and not very fun to hang out with.\n\nJudging others is easy but understanding our own worth is very difficult.",

I  watched all the pretty cheerleader types get dates to prom, boyfriends, roses on valentine's day. So now when a man wants me, I have a bad habit of thinking \"Sir, are you lost ?\" Lol. Outwardly I appear confident but internally I'm telling myself there is no way this guy actually wants me. Then something like this happens and I'm blown away.",
