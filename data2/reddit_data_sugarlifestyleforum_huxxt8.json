    "body": "* a 64 year old unattractive and 300+ lb man who said he wanted a woman 30-40, slim, intelligent, sensual, and cultured. He wouldn\u2019t offer PPM or allowance and he doesn\u2019t like fine dining. He wants someone who likes him for him. \n\n* a 28 year old man, ugly, with gynecomastia, missing a tooth, who wants a \u201csexy hot girl for fun, but she shouldn\u2019t be all about my wallet\u201d \n\n* 70 year old who is into hard sadism, \u201cfilming\u201d, \u201cphotography\u201d, and \u201cweekends at my remote cabin\u201d. \u201cI can go for many rounds so you must be energetic\u201d. He was offering to pay for food only. \n\n\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThis shit doesn\u2019t even fly on vanilla sites. WHY do they try it? How delusional are they?",

I'm not even sure you read my response. Is it possible to be racist towards white people? Yes. Is recognizing toxic consistencies in the behaviors of white people who actively oppress every other race in the world, while not making sure to baby the feelings of every white person who doesnt think they're problematic, racist? No. I'm a white woman, I would not be upset with a black man for being uncomfortable being alone with me on account of the systematic power I potentially hold over him. Am I the type of white woman weaponizing cops against black men? No. Am I upset at the fear black men may have? No. Am I upset with the white women that caused that fear? Yes. I'm not going to scream that NOT ALL WHITE WOMEN DO THIS because enough do that it's a problem, and deflecting doesnt fix the problem, it makes you a part of it.",

I'm not even sure you read my response. Is it possible to be racist towards white people? Yes. Is recognizing toxic consistencies in the behaviors of white people who actively oppress every other race in the world, while not making sure to baby the feelings of every white person who doesnt think they're problematic, racist? No. I'm a white woman, I would not be upset with a black man for being uncomfortable being alone with me on account of the systematic power I potentially hold over him. Am I the type of white woman weaponizing cops against black men? No. Am I upset at the fear black men may have? No. Am I upset with the white women that caused that fear? Yes. I'm not going to scream that NOT ALL WHITE WOMEN DO THIS because enough do that it's a problem, and deflecting doesnt fix the problem, it makes you a part of it.",

No. I'm a white woman, I would not be upset with a black man for being uncomfortable being alone with me on account of the systematic power I potentially hold over him. Am I the type of white woman weaponizing cops against black men? No. Am I upset at the fear black men may have? No. Am I upset with the white women that caused that fear? Yes.

No. I'm a white woman, I would not be upset with a black man for being uncomfortable being alone with me on account of the systematic power I potentially hold over him.

No. I'm a white woman, I would not be upset with a black man for being uncomfortable being alone with me on account of the systematic power I potentially hold over him. Am I the type of white woman weaponizing cops against black men? No. Am I upset at the fear black men may have? No. Am I upset with the white women that caused that fear? Yes.

No. I'm a white woman, I would not be upset with a black man for being uncomfortable being alone with me on account of the systematic power I potentially hold over him. Am I the type of white woman weaponizing cops against black men? No. Am I upset at the fear black men may have? No. Am I upset with the white women that caused that fear? Yes.
