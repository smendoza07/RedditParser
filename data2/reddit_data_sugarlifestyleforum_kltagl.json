    "body": "So I have a bonafide stalker on my hands. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThis guy will not go away and has made an upward of 10+ new SA accounts to reach me and whomever else he\u2019s stalking.\n\nHere I am messaging over the holidays what seems to be a solid potential. Lots in common (again), shared humor (again) and an invitation to a have a meet/greet over lunch today.....\n\nThen as I respond and confirm that the time he picked is good...he hits me with a \u201cjust so you know when you walk in you will remember my face\u201d. \ud83e\udd74 I ask how is that because the profile pictures don\u2019t resonate with me as a familiar face. He says \u201cwell think about all the people you rejected and I\u2019m one of them\u201d.\n\nSo I ask who and what is he talking about. He named the place where we met during the summer and yes I did reject him nicely (complete catfish like not even the same person). \n\nHow many times do I have to report this guy before SA just stops collecting his money and giving him the green light??\n\nI have literally blocked every single account he has recreated and approached me on. Every account/profile is 360 different, no similarities, not even one. \n\nI give it to him that towards the end of solidifying plans he comes clean (again) and admits who he is but it\u2019s still creepy that he keeps approaching me as if he\u2019s going to get a different response after he reveals himself.",

S. SA will be useless on this matter, most likely. They want the $$$, and will always look for excuses to not ban revenue generators like your stalker.",

If OP genuinely feels from her gut that her life is threatened, she should absolutely take action. But some stalking is also mere annoyance. \n\nThere are various degrees of stalkerness. I'm sure OPs facebook, Instagram and SA page is stalked by hundreds of dudes. A few are probably running background checks on her every couple of weeks. Some neighbor dude may also be stalking her. From the story OP has told, dude is definitely obsessive, but the risk of physical harm is appears low. \n\n**Every potential SD she meets has the same risk as this dude**. As long as she meets in public, uses burner phones and takes an Uber back when she feels something is off, it's the best mitigation strategy.",

HA nope, the cops wouldn\u2019t even prosecute my ex boyfriend who violated an active personal protection order I had against him after he violated it 10 times AND I took him to court, gave him a \u201csuspended sentence\u201d ... \n\nWe have to fend for ourselves out here women just being normal (not sex workers) don\u2019t even get protection they deserve.  I second the person who says video chats are a necessary before meets.  Also always always always make sure you have someone knowing where you are when meeting up with these guys.  Shit if you want you can even message me and we can exchange info and you can always let me know where and when you\u2019re going to meet someone just to be safe.  Also maybe take some self defense courses or watch some YouTube videos on self defense, can\u2019t hurt, and set up an ARLO video camera outside your home if that is necessary. Can\u2019t put a price on your safety/piece of mind.  Please, Be careful out there! \u2764\ufe0f",

From the story OP has told, dude is definitely obsessive, but the risk of physical harm is appears low. \n\n**Every potential SD she meets has the same risk as this dude**.

But some stalking is also mere annoyance. \n\nThere are various degrees of stalkerness. I'm sure OPs facebook, Instagram and SA page is stalked by hundreds of dudes. A few are probably running background checks on her every couple of weeks. Some neighbor dude may also be stalking her. From the story OP has told, dude is definitely obsessive, but the risk of physical harm is appears low. \n\n**Every potential SD she meets has the same risk as this dude**. As long as she meets in public, uses burner phones and takes an Uber back when she feels something is off, it's the best mitigation strategy.",
