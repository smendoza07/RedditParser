I think white hair looks great on dark skin and I wanted to keep the majority of my hair black to contrast. But to get that color requires multiple bleaches. After the first bleach I got so many different shades of light yellow in my head and I\u2019m hating how my hair looks. Even though it doesn\u2019t look terrible\n\nNow one more bleach and we\u2019ll be there. But I\u2019ll have to pay the hairdresser again and pay my barber for the cut and retwist which together will be $200. Or.. I could chop it off for $30 lol that\u2019s why I\u2019m considering starting over. They\u2019ve just been really high maintenance and expensive lately.",

Pulls a lot white women and nerdy black women (anime lovers, cosplayers, people like that)\n\n\n2. It's universal however it seems like black women around the ages 28-35, are slightly more attracted.\n\n\n3-5. I haven't had my dreads like this, I only had them like in my profile picture (the Ja Morant/pineapple) but  the way I style my dreads it attracted Arabs, lightskin black women, and valley girl white girls (the white girls that enjoy Starbucks, Target, etc). \n\nLike I said this is all generalizations based on my experience but that's what I noticed when I had different hairstyles. I will also to add when I had the Odell Beckham Jr hairstyle that was universal as well. \n\nAs a Redditor I will say pick whatever makes you feel good because all of them look nice. If I were you however I would go with 5 just because I miss my dreads (but that's for personal reasons).",
