    "body": "Went for coffee with a POT SD yesterday. Chose a neat little spot that he hadn't heard of in a very unique neighborhood. We grabbed a coffee and sat down and just started talking and could not stop. He was so open and honest, and made me feel incredibly beautiful and smart. All around a super great guy. \n\nI had told him over text that I was a bit of a wine snob, having traveled to a particular wine region many times. He told me he didn't know a ton about wine, and suggested we wander over to a wine store so that I could teach him about my favorites. Again - he made me feel so smart and special. It was amazing! We went to the wine store and I gave him a bit of a tutorial on the different wineries and which wines I loved the most. He then told me he was going to choose a bottle based on what I told him and that I was to choose a favorite bottle. Then he bought them both for me! He asked if I'd like to have a picnic in the park for one of our upcoming dates, and suggested I bring the wine for us to share. He was very thoughtful and such a lovely man. \n\nWe've made plans to have dinner on Saturday evening at a quaint little restaurant neither of us has ever been to, and I am so excited to see him! I am so glad I held out for the right one, after going on many unsuccessful M&G's with salt daddy's. Feeling like I'm on cloud 9 right now and just had to share!!",
