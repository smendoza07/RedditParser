    "body": "Ladies, this one is for you. \n\nI have what many aspiring SBs might consider a dream SR in terms of gifts/support. Divided out, my guy provides me with my area\u2019s average monthly allowance worth of gifts and support each week. I stopped keeping track months ago. Thinking about it actually blows my mind a bit. Sitting with that thought actually makes me somewhat uncomfortable...\n\nBecause I love him.\n\nWe spent the past week together packing and moving my stuff (and my kids\u2019 stuff!) to a new apartment. It felt so normal, almost uncomfortably normal. By the time we were finished on the last night and too exhausted to even cuddle to sleep, I worried that I have no mystery left, no sex appeal. When he left in a hurry to go pick up his wife the next day, I cried. He didn\u2019t see it, but I barely made it back into my apartment, because I know that due to the nature of how our relationship began, he could easily get bored and find a newer woman to have sex with. Someone to start fresh with all of the fun and none of the real life complications. \n\nNow, part of that was exhaustion, but I really miss him when he\u2019s gone. It feels like he is supposed to be here, like there is a hole in my life when he\u2019s out living his.\n\nI love him.\n\nI want him, but I know if that my personal trust issues don\u2019t get in the way, familiarity will.\n\nI love him.\n\nI pay attention to how he likes to be touched and complimented and give it to him regularly. I let him know how much I appreciate everything he does, from writing a check to holding the door. I admire him for the man that he his, for the wisdom that he shares. And I cry, not often, but it does happen, because my man is not mine.\n\nHe knows how much I love him, that\u2019s why he treats me so well.\n\n\n\n\nFor those of you who are new here, take time to read these posts and think carefully before joining the bowl. For every high, there is a low and it\u2019s all a part of the game.",

Be joyous in what you have  if that's the way you feel.  Probably what he appreciates the most.  My guess is that he feels his investment in you is great  first for whom you are including being a good mother.  His helping you pack is a pretty strong validation. \n\nWhen you visualize disaster your feet will surely lead the way.",

I already know how easy it is for him to have an affair. I don\u2019t want to question where he is or who he\u2019s texting. I struggle sometimes with the line of our relationship. I have to keep expectations and future fantasies in check.",
