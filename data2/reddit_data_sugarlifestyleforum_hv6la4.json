    "body": "TL;DR Why are there so many posts of SBs avoiding the allowance talk or agreeing to arrangements without money?\n\nI recently received some great career news, so I haven't been on SLF for a bit. Catching up on some threads when I notice a slight trend in posts where SBs aren't getting allowances. Why?\n\n\"I'm already financial independent\" - but you could have more.\n\n\"My parents support me enough\" - but you could have more.\n\n\"We have so much chemistry\" - but...\n\nI genuinely don't understand. Surely the whole point of an SR are the mutual benefits \ud83d\udc31+\ud83d\udcb5?\n\n(Even 'experience/ gift only' arrangements are befuddling to me but at least in those situations an agreement has been made)",

I need to know what the other person is looking for and what kind of help they want. That's all I'm saying. \n\nIf a girl says she is looking for allowance I'll suggest we start with PPM, if she doesn't have a number in mind I'll throw one out based on a past arrangement that is less than the max I can afford. If we've already developed a real connection by the time this conversation happens I'm ok talking about an allowance right off the bat and even throwing out a number. I just need her to be engaged in the conversation and tell me what she wants and needs. \n\nIf she tells me she doesn't need or expect anything, I'm going to take that at face value and assume she wants a vanilla relationship. Sometimes that's an accurate assumption and I've met vanilla partners on SA. Sometimes its not and when the direct financial support doesn't happen the relationship fizzles out. There are plenty of fish in the sea. I'm willing to miss out on someone who is not confident and comfortable enough with their own needs to participate in the conversation like an adult.",

I lifted today and will be doing BJJ in the morning. I put my pics in front of women on Tinder with my age set to 27 and hidden. No touching up, either, hair peppered with gray and lines on my face.

Part of dating much younger women is that it takes happily ever after right off the table. \n\nI'm also hooked. I monopolized 18 years of women under 30 over 3 LTRs, the last being ironically the youngest. I'm hooked. I love the youthful energy (and fertility, even with a condom on).",

If he fails to meet his commitment then speak up and terminate if necessary.  Good sugar relationships almost always involve both respect and trust and failure to provide allowance as promised is a breach of that trust. \n\nI also make it a point to mention to a new SB that her smile affects my brain and that if what she receives is less than our agreement it is a mistake and PLEASE let me know.  I will never reduce an allowance without discussing it (the only time I have done this was with a monthly allowance where she was missing too many meets and  we went back to a PPM with a concurrent increase in reliability ).  Finally, it goes without saying that you don't leave a stack of bills on the bedside table.  New bills , in an envelope that's inserted into her coat pocket, boot or purse (only if it is open) .  My experience is that this process is considered by most great SB to be an added benefit of the relationship. \n\nThere are those who want to pervert the relationship to the point where the allowance is delivered only if they feel like it.

Allowance keeps things on track as an arrangement ,not IRL dating. Unfortunately people are using it inappropriately.  At the same time, I agree that Pros should not be using it either. There are plenty of vanilla and escort sites all for those purposes.",

But having your age as 27, albeit hidden, is a bad idea. You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most. You want to swim in a pool of people that are ok with your age, that's the most efficient way.\n\n>I got lots of matches a few months ago, but the age talk was always rough.

I don't think I could keep it up in an LTR, or in Mississippi. \n\nSo now you have me thinking of Seeking again. \n\nI reinvented myself. I got laid off at the beginning of the Great Recession and lived on student loans, getting my math degree at 41 and launching my career. I'm making full payments and saving for retirement, but I'm 20 years behind. I simply don't have money to throw around. \n\nHowever, I'm good looking, smart, funny, and genuinely conscientious. I'm looking to traffic in boredom, not desperation. I think that the hardcore SB's wouldn't even look twice at me, since I'd be showcasing my slick pad, hand drums, and somewhat muscular frame. It's obvious I'm single by choice.  \n\nThere seems to be mixed feelings around here about using Seeking as strictly vanilla, which is why this post caught my eye.\n\nI directly paid once. I'll never forget it: \"You're fine. What do you need me for? Let me guess, you don't get out much?\" those words sting 30 years later.  Honestly, I could spread a little sugar around, but I can't break the promise to myself to never do that again.",

I've already monopolized 18 years of women under 30, over 3 LTR's. I'm done monopolizing women.

But I've been to many meet n greets where I try to tactfully discuss money and the SD gets really uncomfortable or tries to change the topic as fast as possible. \nAnd there are soooooooo many guys on Seeking that have \"don't want someone who's just after my money\" in their profiles.  I've never bothered with those guys but makes me think that alot of guys are wary of girls that are too needy or greedy. \nThis I think, is partially why wealthier SD's end up with financially independent women.  Because desperation is unattractive. I was living paycheck to paycheck when I started sugar dating, but I did my best to *appear* comfortable.  However not being able to flat out ask for what I thought was fair, turned me off to the whole thing.  Ironically the only sugar relationship that ended up getting anywhere was with a good friend that knew that I was in a tough spot and wanted to see me succeed.\nEventually I gave up on sugar dating and transitioned to escorting, where I could name my price and charge per hour. \nI would still love to find a SD that is willing to make it worth my while, but the time/energy I have put into finding one in the past has proven not to have a good return on investment.\n\n*I should acknowledgw that I was at a bit of a disadvantage because I fall into the BBW category. I figured that it would rule me out for alot of the high rollers but I think it ended up hindering me more than I initially anticipated. Maybe not, it's hard to tell, but I always got the impression that guys weren't willing to pay as high of an allowance because I'm not thin.",

Both middle aged and attractive but not very motivated or financially stable, both also less than 6mo each. Had they been in their 20s (even to mid 30s) like myself I\u2019d understand and could overlook it. \u2018Cause who tf knows a stable person in their 20s whose lives weren\u2019t already predetermined for them?. Anyway. Every date, every dinner, every adventure, every gas station stop, every everything I always paid for it, even helped with a bill or two. Looking back on it was I foolish, yes. But in my heart I felt like I was helping because they were never mean, nasty or rude and always expressed gratitude and appreciation. But after the last guy I just knew I couldn\u2019t do it again. I learned that I don\u2019t mind helping but I won\u2019t do it all. I wanted to feel what it was like to be on the receiving end without expectation of return. To be cared for and admired so much that someone just wants to do for you, treat you, dine you, gift you, shower you with tokens of affection and appreciation. Whether it be $20 for lunch or a 2 day getaway at no cost. Because I\u2019m that type of person. So I guess truly I didn\u2019t want a SD, but it was a suggested way to find the type of gentleman who\u2019s ambitious, driven, and may have hard days/times but is willing to put in work to get hisself out of it. I respect & find that more attractive in a man more than the actual dollar value his taxes show. I tried the ppm but the deliberate exchange for $ because I spend time with someone just didn\u2019t sit right with me. If I\u2019m around you I want to be, period. And I don\u2019t ask for $ b/c frankly I wasn\u2019t raised that way, and even if I did want someone else to pay for anything just b/c I knew they would I couldn\u2019t bring myself to make the words, it just feels so against my nature. But random cash apps and gift w/o asking is always awesome! Just to wake up or come out of a meeting like \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d hellooooooo sally!!!! Tokens of appreciation & \u201cI\u2019m thinking of you\u201d expressed in ANY way is always appreciated! It\u2019s different for each person. But there\u2019s a little insight from someone who fits the profile of the question perfectly \ud83d\ude05",

I need to know what the other person is looking for and what kind of help they want. That's all I'm saying. \n\nIf a girl says she is looking for allowance I'll suggest we start with PPM, if she doesn't have a number in mind I'll throw one out based on a past arrangement that is less than the max I can afford. If we've already developed a real connection by the time this conversation happens I'm ok talking about an allowance right off the bat and even throwing out a number. I just need her to be engaged in the conversation and tell me what she wants and needs. \n\nIf she tells me she doesn't need or expect anything, I'm going to take that at face value and assume she wants a vanilla relationship. Sometimes that's an accurate assumption and I've met vanilla partners on SA. Sometimes its not and when the direct financial support doesn't happen the relationship fizzles out. There are plenty of fish in the sea. I'm willing to miss out on someone who is not confident and comfortable enough with their own needs to participate in the conversation like an adult.",

If he fails to meet his commitment then speak up and terminate if necessary.  Good sugar relationships almost always involve both respect and trust and failure to provide allowance as promised is a breach of that trust. \n\nI also make it a point to mention to a new SB that her smile affects my brain and that if what she receives is less than our agreement it is a mistake and PLEASE let me know.  I will never reduce an allowance without discussing it (the only time I have done this was with a monthly allowance where she was missing too many meets and  we went back to a PPM with a concurrent increase in reliability ).  Finally, it goes without saying that you don't leave a stack of bills on the bedside table.  New bills , in an envelope that's inserted into her coat pocket, boot or purse (only if it is open) .  My experience is that this process is considered by most great SB to be an added benefit of the relationship. \n\nThere are those who want to pervert the relationship to the point where the allowance is delivered only if they feel like it.

But having your age as 27, albeit hidden, is a bad idea. You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most. You want to swim in a pool of people that are ok with your age, that's the most efficient way.\n\n>I got lots of matches a few months ago, but the age talk was always rough.

However, that could be worth revisiting these days.  \n\n> It's kind of unattractive and actually not at all accurate.\n\nI roll with some young studs in BJJ and they routinely kick my ass :D \n\n> Porn obsessed low-T fatties span all age ranges, trust me!\n\nOh, I do. \n\nIt's weird....I've been single (with one FB) for a few years, and I live in a good looking corner of a good looking city in a good looking state. I don't think I could keep it up in an LTR, or in Mississippi. \n\nSo now you have me thinking of Seeking again. \n\nI reinvented myself. I got laid off at the beginning of the Great Recession and lived on student loans, getting my math degree at 41 and launching my career. I'm making full payments and saving for retirement, but I'm 20 years behind. I simply don't have money to throw around. \n\nHowever, I'm good looking, smart, funny, and genuinely conscientious. I'm looking to traffic in boredom, not desperation. I think that the hardcore SB's wouldn't even look twice at me, since I'd be showcasing my slick pad, hand drums, and somewhat muscular frame. It's obvious I'm single by choice.  \n\nThere seems to be mixed feelings around here about using Seeking as strictly vanilla, which is why this post caught my eye.\n\nI directly paid once. I'll never forget it: \"You're fine. What do you need me for? Let me guess, you don't get out much?\" those words sting 30 years later.  Honestly, I could spread a little sugar around, but I can't break the promise to myself to never do that again.",

I'm a rock of stability in the raging torrents of a global pandemic. \n\n> Do you really think these women want to be a forever girlfriend and waste their best years\n\nAbsolutely not. I've already monopolized 18 years of women under 30, over 3 LTR's. I'm done monopolizing women. I have less of an issue with commitment and more of an issue of getting used to being the fun guy you fuck while looking for something better. \n\n> to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong\n\nI agree entirely. That said, I was lying to Tinder, not the women. I did nothing to conceal the lines in my face or gray in my hair. And the advice I've read for \"salt game\" advises you do exactly that. Um, no. I won't do that.",

That's all I'm saying. \n\nIf a girl says she is looking for allowance I'll suggest we start with PPM, if she doesn't have a number in mind I'll throw one out based on a past arrangement that is less than the max I can afford. If we've already developed a real connection by the time this conversation happens I'm ok talking about an allowance right off the bat and even throwing out a number. I just need her to be engaged in the conversation and tell me what she wants and needs. \n\nIf she tells me she doesn't need or expect anything, I'm going to take that at face value and assume she wants a vanilla relationship. Sometimes that's an accurate assumption and I've met vanilla partners on SA. Sometimes its not and when the direct financial support doesn't happen the relationship fizzles out.

I lifted today and will be doing BJJ in the morning. I put my pics in front of women on Tinder with my age set to 27 and hidden. No touching up, either, hair peppered with gray and lines on my face.

I monopolized 18 years of women under 30 over 3 LTRs, the last being ironically the youngest. I'm hooked. I love the youthful energy (and fertility, even with a condom on).",

I will never reduce an allowance without discussing it (the only time I have done this was with a monthly allowance where she was missing too many meets and  we went back to a PPM with a concurrent increase in reliability ).  Finally, it goes without saying that you don't leave a stack of bills on the bedside table.  New bills , in an envelope that's inserted into her coat pocket, boot or purse (only if it is open) .

But having your age as 27, albeit hidden, is a bad idea. You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most. You want to swim in a pool of people that are ok with your age, that's the most efficient way.\n\n>I got lots of matches a few months ago, but the age talk was always rough.

I don't think I could keep it up in an LTR, or in Mississippi. \n\nSo now you have me thinking of Seeking again. \n\nI reinvented myself. I got laid off at the beginning of the Great Recession and lived on student loans, getting my math degree at 41 and launching my career. I'm making full payments and saving for retirement, but I'm 20 years behind. I simply don't have money to throw around. \n\nHowever, I'm good looking, smart, funny, and genuinely conscientious. I'm looking to traffic in boredom, not desperation. I think that the hardcore SB's wouldn't even look twice at me, since I'd be showcasing my slick pad, hand drums, and somewhat muscular frame. It's obvious I'm single by choice.  \n\nThere seems to be mixed feelings around here about using Seeking as strictly vanilla, which is why this post caught my eye.\n\nI directly paid once. I'll never forget it: \"You're fine. What do you need me for? Let me guess, you don't get out much?\" those words sting 30 years later.  Honestly, I could spread a little sugar around, but I can't break the promise to myself to never do that again.",

I'm a rock of stability in the raging torrents of a global pandemic. \n\n> Do you really think these women want to be a forever girlfriend and waste their best years\n\nAbsolutely not. I've already monopolized 18 years of women under 30, over 3 LTR's. I'm done monopolizing women. I have less of an issue with commitment and more of an issue of getting used to being the fun guy you fuck while looking for something better. \n\n> to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong\n\nI agree entirely. That said, I was lying to Tinder, not the women. I did nothing to conceal the lines in my face or gray in my hair. And the advice I've read for \"salt game\" advises you do exactly that. Um, no. I won't do that.",

But I don't have a boiler plate \"offer.\" I've had successful relationships from SA that were anywhere on the spectrum from vanilla with gifts/experiences, to informal direct financial support, to a structured PPM or allowance. I need to know what the other person is looking for and what kind of help they want. That's all I'm saying. \n\nIf a girl says she is looking for allowance I'll suggest we start with PPM, if she doesn't have a number in mind I'll throw one out based on a past arrangement that is less than the max I can afford. If we've already developed a real connection by the time this conversation happens I'm ok talking about an allowance right off the bat and even throwing out a number. I just need her to be engaged in the conversation and tell me what she wants and needs. \n\nIf she tells me she doesn't need or expect anything, I'm going to take that at face value and assume she wants a vanilla relationship. Sometimes that's an accurate assumption and I've met vanilla partners on SA. Sometimes its not and when the direct financial support doesn't happen the relationship fizzles out. There are plenty of fish in the sea. I'm willing to miss out on someone who is not confident and comfortable enough with their own needs to participate in the conversation like an adult.",

But having your age as 27, albeit hidden, is a bad idea. You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most. You want to swim in a pool of people that are ok with your age, that's the most efficient way.\n\n>I got lots of matches a few months ago, but the age talk was always rough.

However, that could be worth revisiting these days.  \n\n> It's kind of unattractive and actually not at all accurate.\n\nI roll with some young studs in BJJ and they routinely kick my ass :D \n\n> Porn obsessed low-T fatties span all age ranges, trust me!\n\nOh, I do. \n\nIt's weird....I've been single (with one FB) for a few years, and I live in a good looking corner of a good looking city in a good looking state. I don't think I could keep it up in an LTR, or in Mississippi. \n\nSo now you have me thinking of Seeking again. \n\nI reinvented myself. I got laid off at the beginning of the Great Recession and lived on student loans, getting my math degree at 41 and launching my career. I'm making full payments and saving for retirement, but I'm 20 years behind. I simply don't have money to throw around. \n\nHowever, I'm good looking, smart, funny, and genuinely conscientious. I'm looking to traffic in boredom, not desperation. I think that the hardcore SB's wouldn't even look twice at me, since I'd be showcasing my slick pad, hand drums, and somewhat muscular frame. It's obvious I'm single by choice.  \n\nThere seems to be mixed feelings around here about using Seeking as strictly vanilla, which is why this post caught my eye.\n\nI directly paid once. I'll never forget it: \"You're fine. What do you need me for? Let me guess, you don't get out much?\" those words sting 30 years later.  Honestly, I could spread a little sugar around, but I can't break the promise to myself to never do that again.",

I'm a rock of stability in the raging torrents of a global pandemic. \n\n> Do you really think these women want to be a forever girlfriend and waste their best years\n\nAbsolutely not. I've already monopolized 18 years of women under 30, over 3 LTR's. I'm done monopolizing women. I have less of an issue with commitment and more of an issue of getting used to being the fun guy you fuck while looking for something better. \n\n> to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong\n\nI agree entirely. That said, I was lying to Tinder, not the women. I did nothing to conceal the lines in my face or gray in my hair. And the advice I've read for \"salt game\" advises you do exactly that. Um, no. I won't do that.",

                    "body": "Sure - I can communicate what I'm open to and will answer questions about past arrangements. But I don't have a boiler plate \"offer.\" I've had successful relationships from SA that were anywhere on the spectrum from vanilla with gifts/experiences, to informal direct financial support, to a structured PPM or allowance. I need to know what the other person is looking for and what kind of help they want. That's all I'm saying. \n\nIf a girl says she is looking for allowance I'll suggest we start with PPM, if she doesn't have a number in mind I'll throw one out based on a past arrangement that is less than the max I can afford. If we've already developed a real connection by the time this conversation happens I'm ok talking about an allowance right off the bat and even throwing out a number. I just need her to be engaged in the conversation and tell me what she wants and needs. \n\nIf she tells me she doesn't need or expect anything, I'm going to take that at face value and assume she wants a vanilla relationship. Sometimes that's an accurate assumption and I've met vanilla partners on SA. Sometimes its not and when the direct financial support doesn't happen the relationship fizzles out. There are plenty of fish in the sea. I'm willing to miss out on someone who is not confident and comfortable enough with their own needs to participate in the conversation like an adult.",

But having your age as 27, albeit hidden, is a bad idea. You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most.

One thing to erase 3-4 years, but to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong... Even if one feels young at heart this is pretty fucked up and deceptive!",

I've already monopolized 18 years of women under 30, over 3 LTR's. I'm done monopolizing women. I have less of an issue with commitment and more of an issue of getting used to being the fun guy you fuck while looking for something better. \n\n> to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong\n\nI agree entirely. That said, I was lying to Tinder, not the women. I did nothing to conceal the lines in my face or gray in my hair. And the advice I've read for \"salt game\" advises you do exactly that. Um, no. I won't do that.",

Sometimes that's an accurate assumption and I've met vanilla partners on SA. Sometimes its not and when the direct financial support doesn't happen the relationship fizzles out.

But having your age as 27, albeit hidden, is a bad idea. You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most.

One thing to erase 3-4 years, but to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong... Even if one feels young at heart this is pretty fucked up and deceptive!",

You're going to be shown to girls who are looking for men in their twenties and an older guy who randomly pops up is almost certainly going to elicit a confused face and an immediate left swipe for most.

I've already monopolized 18 years of women under 30, over 3 LTR's. I'm done monopolizing women.

That said, I was lying to Tinder, not the women. I did nothing to conceal the lines in my face or gray in my hair. And the advice I've read for \"salt game\" advises you do exactly that. Um, no. I won't do that.",

Their tones were incredulous. They were annoyed. If they thought I was generous, they'd have taken a different tack. \n\nPlus, they'd be swiping on dudes being way more honest about their ages. \n\nThere's nothing generous in my profile. If I put a profile up on Seeking, it won't be generous, either. No games. \n\nIf I wasn't exceptionally good looking, I wouldn't even try.",

They are not getting any benefits from you even if they would be open to a vanilla relationship.\n\nDo you really think these women want to be a forever girlfriend and waste their best years on a broke dude nearing 50's who has commitment issues lol. All this because you think you look good for your age and you work out \ud83d\ude44\n\nAt least the SD's that offer experiences instead of allowance still pay for vacations, shopping etc. You basically want a hot young woman just because you happen to exist and you take care of your body...\n\nAnd it's super shitty to lie 20 years of your age. One thing to erase 3-4 years, but to pretend you are 27 when you will soon be 50 is all kinds of wrong... Even if one feels young at heart this is pretty fucked up and deceptive!",
