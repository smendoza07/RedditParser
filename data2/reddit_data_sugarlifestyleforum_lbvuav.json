    "body": "I feel like someone needs to pinch me.\n\nTwo days ago I spent the night under the stars here in Cali with my SD and two of his other SB's I'd just met. We had cocktails and drank and bullshitted snuggled under blankets, and then our SD made us all fillet mignon while we supervised.  It was my first night out and about in years.\n\nTonight we're all going to have a pajama party with smores while I jam on one of his guitars.\n\nThen I'll be going home to MY apartment where no one will be there to hurt me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis must be a dream. Sugaring is a dream.",

I don't (well, didn't!) have any friends here, and she's SO KIND.
