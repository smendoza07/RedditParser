And the funny thing is I'm a Somin fan, but I don't worship her some some of you fools do in here, y'all are just as bad as the Song Ji Hyo fans who attack Somin for idiotic reasons.

I just simply said I didn't think she was \"cute\" with the new haircut & the members feel the same except for SJH who said she was \"pretty\"\n\nEven Somin commented on the fact that people were looking at her strange after the haircut, so I guess she is also \"unproductive\" and \"negative\" for bringing up other peoples opinions that don't match her own. \n\n\"Look at So Min's cute new bangs!...Ha Ha & So Min & Jong Kook  l Running Man Ep 624\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X\\_NEhj\\_12G4&t=97s",

Your vocabulary and your way of presenting your opinion is what's wrong here. You didn't say you don't think she looks cute.

It's as if you are arguing about her being cute, as if that is something to even argue about! You also mentioned other members, as if to support what you were saying - kind of like a \"if they can say it, so can I\". \n\nI hope you realize that you can voice an opinion freely, but it isn't nice to argue about someone's looks. She can make fun of herself. Her close friends can do it for variety sake too. But you're a stranger. Think about how your comment looks and sounds. \n\nAnd why would you feel the need to bring up SJH here? This is not about her and her fans. I don't understand why everything has to be turned into a fan war and comparison. I would have said the same thing if you commented this under a picture of SJH. There are usually no mean comments like this for her pictures as the moderators are huge fans of her and immediately delete any bad comments. I wish they would do the same for JSM. There are a couple of people (not you) who routinely write dismissive and rude comments under her pics and nothing gets done.",

I'm sure there are a few who just go around downvoting any comments saying something positive about JSM and SJH. \n\nI didn't know what you meant, but took the time (literally 12 seconds!) To google it and found out you're not calling her something bad. So I decided to share the link. Most people won't do this. (I hope this doesn't sound like I'm gloating. I'm just way too invested in this show and have a bit of time and also google everything.)",

It is sad that you call fans of a person a cult. \n\nA happy and healthy person wouldn't feel the need to ruin other people's joy and rain on their parade. Only a sad person would. It is sad that your only contribution to a positive thread is negativity; and negativity that you felt you needed to voice! Which is even more sad.
