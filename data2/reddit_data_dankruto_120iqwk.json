He says or does the dumbest shit at the worst time, which is not just frustrating but potentially dangerous.\n\nI can see getting fed up with that shit when you\u2019re around it for 8 hours while chasing a cat or weeding gardens in the sticky heat. \n\nShould she learn to control her temper better and keep her hands to herself? Yes. I think she gets better at this and at being more thoughtful and considerate towards people (especially Naruto) as she gets older. \n\nDo best friends still get to smack each other upside the head once in awhile if they\u2019re being particularly annoying? In the context of a show like Naruto with slapstick comedy elements, I\u2019d say yes. (But I had 3 brothers so that may affect my opinion here.)\n\nCharacters with no flaws or development aren\u2019t interesting, and it\u2019s just unfortunate that Kishimoto didn\u2019t take the time and effort to properly show Sakura mature and outgrow some of the worst of her character flaws.",

You may be right that she\u2019s louder than I recall, but I think I\u2019d remember if it was that major of a character trait.

She left \u201cquiet\u201d three stops back and just whispers \u201cano\u201d to her own chest while fidgeting instead of speaking like a normal, functioning teenager. She can hardly say three audible words to people she\u2019s been in school with for years. That\u2019s not quiet, that\u2019s a pathological anxiety disorder. I  just feel pity for her. \n\nI also wish I had a nickel for every time a Sakura-hater quoted that one thoughtless comment she made when she was 12. It was a big foot-in-mouth moment, but those happen to everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like she made fun of Naruto\u2019s orphan status often.\n\nI guess I\u2019d be wasting my energy trying to discuss this further. But it is possible to acknowledge Sakura\u2019s good points while still being a Hinata fan. I admitted Sakura had flaws.\n\nThat said, girls socially mature faster and I remember how annoying 12 year old boys were when I was that age, and it makes me feel like her behavior isn\u2019t totally unconscionable.",

That sucks , Imagine seeing one of ur fav characters nerfed like that , that's the worst thing possible ( u can't even call it a nerf , it's straight insulting the cool sasuke character ) \n\n.

He tried to burn down her village and kill her parents and was only stopped by Zetsu who told him about Danzo, making him change his mind and go to the Land of Iron. Dude legit threatened to kill Naruto and enslave the world and her response is not to support Naruto in any way but confess her feelings for Sasuke on the spot.  \n\n\nI think IRL her friends and family would make an intervenction and try to pull her out of this toxicity.",

She does whatever he wants without questioning. He arrives home after being missing for ten years and she doesn't shout at him, or give him a dressing down for missing their daughter's childhood or anything, she just gets horny and passes out.  \n\n\nThe very first time Sakura complains about anything regarding Sasuke, was on a filler episode of Boruto, where she is having a Girl's Night and drunkily says that Sasuke is a jerk and who is never at home. Ino says that she and Sai can't stop arguing with each other sometimes. While Hinata says that she and Naruto never really argue about anything, making the other girls angry because Hinata was bragging, but then they laugh. Very realistic moment, but unfortunately, it's filler.",

Also we tend to forget that his family is composed of the best Doctor in Konoha who is obviously busy, a Daughter who is also an Uchiha and happens to be a Chunnin constantly going on missions too, and he has to somehow track down aliens that are coming to literally kill him and his family. He\u2019s not trying to stay away from the village but him being there makes the entire village a target, even more so with Naruto as Hokage.\nPpl like to talk bad about Boruto but tbh these last few episodes were straight gas. We got to see Sasuke and Sakura talking about EXACTLY this, and that they aren\u2019t worried about it. The one who brought it up was Sasuke, he even made Sakura a chakra engagement ring because he was on a mission were it was customary to have a wedding ring and it made him miss Sakura. Sakura took a dangerous mission to BE at Sasukes side and shit got dicey. Only proving that Sasuke is basically in constant war, but it won\u2019t stop him from coming home and seeing his daughter.\nTLDR: Sasuke and Sakuras relationship is complicated and long distance, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t fully love and trust each other, or that Saskue isn\u2019t trying. He\u2019s just the Last Uchiha Ex-Rinnegan 2nd strongest shinobi in history who had a terrorist phase. So uhh\u2026 that comes with consequences",

He says or does the dumbest shit at the worst time, which is not just frustrating but potentially dangerous.\n\nI can see getting fed up with that shit when you\u2019re around it for 8 hours while chasing a cat or weeding gardens in the sticky heat. \n\nShould she learn to control her temper better and keep her hands to herself? Yes. I think she gets better at this and at being more thoughtful and considerate towards people (especially Naruto) as she gets older. \n\nDo best friends still get to smack each other upside the head once in awhile if they\u2019re being particularly annoying? In the context of a show like Naruto with slapstick comedy elements, I\u2019d say yes. (But I had 3 brothers so that may affect my opinion here.)\n\nCharacters with no flaws or development aren\u2019t interesting, and it\u2019s just unfortunate that Kishimoto didn\u2019t take the time and effort to properly show Sakura mature and outgrow some of the worst of her character flaws.",

You may be right that she\u2019s louder than I recall, but I think I\u2019d remember if it was that major of a character trait.

She left \u201cquiet\u201d three stops back and just whispers \u201cano\u201d to her own chest while fidgeting instead of speaking like a normal, functioning teenager. She can hardly say three audible words to people she\u2019s been in school with for years. That\u2019s not quiet, that\u2019s a pathological anxiety disorder. I  just feel pity for her. \n\nI also wish I had a nickel for every time a Sakura-hater quoted that one thoughtless comment she made when she was 12. It was a big foot-in-mouth moment, but those happen to everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like she made fun of Naruto\u2019s orphan status often.\n\nI guess I\u2019d be wasting my energy trying to discuss this further. But it is possible to acknowledge Sakura\u2019s good points while still being a Hinata fan. I admitted Sakura had flaws.\n\nThat said, girls socially mature faster and I remember how annoying 12 year old boys were when I was that age, and it makes me feel like her behavior isn\u2019t totally unconscionable.",

She does whatever he wants without questioning. He arrives home after being missing for ten years and she doesn't shout at him, or give him a dressing down for missing their daughter's childhood or anything, she just gets horny and passes out.  \n\n\nThe very first time Sakura complains about anything regarding Sasuke, was on a filler episode of Boruto, where she is having a Girl's Night and drunkily says that Sasuke is a jerk and who is never at home. Ino says that she and Sai can't stop arguing with each other sometimes. While Hinata says that she and Naruto never really argue about anything, making the other girls angry because Hinata was bragging, but then they laugh. Very realistic moment, but unfortunately, it's filler.",

Also we tend to forget that his family is composed of the best Doctor in Konoha who is obviously busy, a Daughter who is also an Uchiha and happens to be a Chunnin constantly going on missions too, and he has to somehow track down aliens that are coming to literally kill him and his family. He\u2019s not trying to stay away from the village but him being there makes the entire village a target, even more so with Naruto as Hokage.\nPpl like to talk bad about Boruto but tbh these last few episodes were straight gas. We got to see Sasuke and Sakura talking about EXACTLY this, and that they aren\u2019t worried about it. The one who brought it up was Sasuke, he even made Sakura a chakra engagement ring because he was on a mission were it was customary to have a wedding ring and it made him miss Sakura. Sakura took a dangerous mission to BE at Sasukes side and shit got dicey. Only proving that Sasuke is basically in constant war, but it won\u2019t stop him from coming home and seeing his daughter.\nTLDR: Sasuke and Sakuras relationship is complicated and long distance, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t fully love and trust each other, or that Saskue isn\u2019t trying. He\u2019s just the Last Uchiha Ex-Rinnegan 2nd strongest shinobi in history who had a terrorist phase. So uhh\u2026 that comes with consequences",

He says or does the dumbest shit at the worst time, which is not just frustrating but potentially dangerous.\n\nI can see getting fed up with that shit when you\u2019re around it for 8 hours while chasing a cat or weeding gardens in the sticky heat. \n\nShould she learn to control her temper better and keep her hands to herself? Yes. I think she gets better at this and at being more thoughtful and considerate towards people (especially Naruto) as she gets older. \n\nDo best friends still get to smack each other upside the head once in awhile if they\u2019re being particularly annoying? In the context of a show like Naruto with slapstick comedy elements, I\u2019d say yes. (But I had 3 brothers so that may affect my opinion here.)\n\nCharacters with no flaws or development aren\u2019t interesting, and it\u2019s just unfortunate that Kishimoto didn\u2019t take the time and effort to properly show Sakura mature and outgrow some of the worst of her character flaws.",

She left \u201cquiet\u201d three stops back and just whispers \u201cano\u201d to her own chest while fidgeting instead of speaking like a normal, functioning teenager. She can hardly say three audible words to people she\u2019s been in school with for years. That\u2019s not quiet, that\u2019s a pathological anxiety disorder. I  just feel pity for her. \n\nI also wish I had a nickel for every time a Sakura-hater quoted that one thoughtless comment she made when she was 12. It was a big foot-in-mouth moment, but those happen to everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like she made fun of Naruto\u2019s orphan status often.\n\nI guess I\u2019d be wasting my energy trying to discuss this further. But it is possible to acknowledge Sakura\u2019s good points while still being a Hinata fan. I admitted Sakura had flaws.\n\nThat said, girls socially mature faster and I remember how annoying 12 year old boys were when I was that age, and it makes me feel like her behavior isn\u2019t totally unconscionable.",

That sucks , Imagine seeing one of ur fav characters nerfed like that , that's the worst thing possible ( u can't even call it a nerf , it's straight insulting the cool sasuke character ) \n\n. I wish they just kill him , he already has been a joke in Boruto due to loosing rinnegan and being out of chakra all the time",

Also we tend to forget that his family is composed of the best Doctor in Konoha who is obviously busy, a Daughter who is also an Uchiha and happens to be a Chunnin constantly going on missions too, and he has to somehow track down aliens that are coming to literally kill him and his family. He\u2019s not trying to stay away from the village but him being there makes the entire village a target, even more so with Naruto as Hokage.\nPpl like to talk bad about Boruto but tbh these last few episodes were straight gas. We got to see Sasuke and Sakura talking about EXACTLY this, and that they aren\u2019t worried about it. The one who brought it up was Sasuke, he even made Sakura a chakra engagement ring because he was on a mission were it was customary to have a wedding ring and it made him miss Sakura. Sakura took a dangerous mission to BE at Sasukes side and shit got dicey. Only proving that Sasuke is basically in constant war, but it won\u2019t stop him from coming home and seeing his daughter.\nTLDR: Sasuke and Sakuras relationship is complicated and long distance, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t fully love and trust each other, or that Saskue isn\u2019t trying. He\u2019s just the Last Uchiha Ex-Rinnegan 2nd strongest shinobi in history who had a terrorist phase. So uhh\u2026 that comes with consequences",

He says or does the dumbest shit at the worst time, which is not just frustrating but potentially dangerous.\n\nI can see getting fed up with that shit when you\u2019re around it for 8 hours while chasing a cat or weeding gardens in the sticky heat. \n\nShould she learn to control her temper better and keep her hands to herself? Yes. I think she gets better at this and at being more thoughtful and considerate towards people (especially Naruto) as she gets older. \n\nDo best friends still get to smack each other upside the head once in awhile if they\u2019re being particularly annoying? In the context of a show like Naruto with slapstick comedy elements, I\u2019d say yes. (But I had 3 brothers so that may affect my opinion here.)\n\nCharacters with no flaws or development aren\u2019t interesting, and it\u2019s just unfortunate that Kishimoto didn\u2019t take the time and effort to properly show Sakura mature and outgrow some of the worst of her character flaws.",

I did say she needed to control her anger better(which would include the yelling).\n\nHinata is on the opposite end to her detriment. She left \u201cquiet\u201d three stops back and just whispers \u201cano\u201d to her own chest while fidgeting instead of speaking like a normal, functioning teenager. She can hardly say three audible words to people she\u2019s been in school with for years. That\u2019s not quiet, that\u2019s a pathological anxiety disorder. I  just feel pity for her. \n\nI also wish I had a nickel for every time a Sakura-hater quoted that one thoughtless comment she made when she was 12. It was a big foot-in-mouth moment, but those happen to everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like she made fun of Naruto\u2019s orphan status often.\n\nI guess I\u2019d be wasting my energy trying to discuss this further. But it is possible to acknowledge Sakura\u2019s good points while still being a Hinata fan. I admitted Sakura had flaws.\n\nThat said, girls socially mature faster and I remember how annoying 12 year old boys were when I was that age, and it makes me feel like her behavior isn\u2019t totally unconscionable.",

With that kind of relationship he may as well give her money each time he leaves XD.\n\nYeah, Sakura is definitely much more of a simp than Karin.",

Let's say Sarada marries Boruto (which seems what Kishimoto is going for) - she becomes Uzumaki Sarada, her children will have the Uzumaki name as well, and poof the Uchiha Clan is gone. UNLESS Sarada marries a civilian or a nobody like Sai, so he adopts her name instead. Ino did exactly that.\n\nHe should have a lot more children, expecially boys, if he realistically wants to keep his clan alive. But I doubt he gives a fuck about the Uchiha clan.",

She left \u201cquiet\u201d three stops back and just whispers \u201cano\u201d to her own chest while fidgeting instead of speaking like a normal, functioning teenager. She can hardly say three audible words to people she\u2019s been in school with for years. That\u2019s not quiet, that\u2019s a pathological anxiety disorder. I  just feel pity for her. \n\nI also wish I had a nickel for every time a Sakura-hater quoted that one thoughtless comment she made when she was 12. It was a big foot-in-mouth moment, but those happen to everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like she made fun of Naruto\u2019s orphan status often.\n\nI guess I\u2019d be wasting my energy trying to discuss this further. But it is possible to acknowledge Sakura\u2019s good points while still being a Hinata fan. I admitted Sakura had flaws.\n\nThat said, girls socially mature faster and I remember how annoying 12 year old boys were when I was that age, and it makes me feel like her behavior isn\u2019t totally unconscionable.",

She left \u201cquiet\u201d three stops back and just whispers \u201cano\u201d to her own chest while fidgeting instead of speaking like a normal, functioning teenager. She can hardly say three audible words to people she\u2019s been in school with for years. That\u2019s not quiet, that\u2019s a pathological anxiety disorder. I  just feel pity for her. \n\nI also wish I had a nickel for every time a Sakura-hater quoted that one thoughtless comment she made when she was 12. It was a big foot-in-mouth moment, but those happen to everyone, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like she made fun of Naruto\u2019s orphan status often.\n\nI guess I\u2019d be wasting my energy trying to discuss this further. But it is possible to acknowledge Sakura\u2019s good points while still being a Hinata fan. I admitted Sakura had flaws.\n\nThat said, girls socially mature faster and I remember how annoying 12 year old boys were when I was that age, and it makes me feel like her behavior isn\u2019t totally unconscionable.",
