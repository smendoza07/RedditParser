            "body": "First, I want to applaud your confidence for posting. It takes a lot to acknowledge that a change needs to be made, and to put it all out there to ask for help. For that, I say you\u2019re already doing great.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what you need to hear, but I\u2019ll put it more nicely than some of the others. Your lot in the genetic lottery as related to hair unfortunately just isn\u2019t a great one, and while it\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s not unsolvable. However, here\u2019s the ugly truth: there is a combination of issues at work here, none of which are to your benefit. These issues, while potentially solvable, will require effort and dedication on your part to fix. Nothing in life comes easy, and that\u2019s just how it is. \n\nOn a more cheery and constructive note, let\u2019s see what can be improved upon:\n\n1) Hair\n\n-With regards to male hair, for most of us it tends to fall out. You can beg and plead and buy creams and moisturizers and conditioners and every other supplement under the sun, but once you\u2019re past a certain point the options become more expensive, and the chances of success lessen. \n-Rogaine is used by many men in order to see long-term hair benefits, but this is not always effective. For some men, Rogaine and similar products do provide increased hair growth, but for others it has no effect at all. Combine with this, the fact that any **head** hair gained from Rogaine will eventually fall out when you stop, it\u2019s very much ineffective in the long term.\n\n-Expensive treatments such as hair implants, micro-blading of the head, and a few others I\u2019m not remembering do exist and can see monumental in some cases, but they are extremely cost prohibitive, and there is still a chance that the hair implants won\u2019t take to the recipient. \n\n-This technique is the best of all of them, cheapest, and literally cannot fail. Shaving the head, is the best route to take in this scenario. There is nothing wrong with having short hair, and I believe you will immediately feel better about yourself once you take the leap. Whatever style you decide to go for, with short hair you really can\u2019t go wrong. You\u2019ll spend less on shampoo and hair treatments, never have to worry about trying to style your hair, and best of all will never look out of place in any environment, there\u2019s short-haired and bald people literally everywhere, have you ever given them a second look?\n\n2) Beard\n\n-Your beard is very thin, as I\u2019m sure you can very well tell. It\u2019s been growing for a while, but you just aren\u2019t quite happy with how it\u2019s turning out right? The beard, just like hair, can be improved, but the fun thing about the beard is that it can be improved to a much better degree.\n\n-First off, go check out /r/minoxbeards, it\u2019s a sub dedicated to the use of Minoxadil (the key ingredient in Rogaine and other hair supplements) on a beard. The short version of a long story there is that, contrasting the head, beards can be permanently thickened with enough consistent use of Minox. It\u2019s not perfect, as again not everyone is affected by it, but there have even been FTM trans people there who have grown out some pretty impressive facial hair, honestly some better than my own. \n\n-If Minox isn\u2019t for you, you\u2019re beard could honestly be improved by getting a trim. Go to a good barber, one with good google reviews relating to beard service and maintenance. They can point you in the right direction there, and I\u2019d bet beyond a shadow of a doubt that there\u2019s something they can do for you.\n\n3)Weight (The Rough One)\n\n-This is not an attack on you or your body, and I do **not** and will not suggest in any way that you deserve any sort of ridicule or shame as a result. \n\n-With that out of the way, the best way to look better and be more comfortable in your own skin, is to make progress towards a more healthy weight. I am saying this as a bigger man to a bigger man. I used to be incredibly obese, but now I\u2019m going in the right direction towards a healthy weight. If you really want to see where I\u2019m at now, there\u2019s a couple pics in my post history of what I look like relatively recently. The point that I\u2019m trying to make is that ever since I\u2019ve started making conscientious choices to improve my overall bodily health, I find that I feel better about myself and also receive complements from my friends and others when they see my progress. This feels great, and I\u2019d be hard pressed to say it doesn\u2019t pad my ego a bit every single time. If I can do this stuff, you can too, it won\u2019t kill you, in fact it\u2019ll make your life better.\n\n-Give /r/intermittentfasting a look, it\u2019s pretty effective. Essentially how it works is you set yourself a caloric limit, and give yourself a time period (typically later in the day) in which you allow yourself to eat. Anytime outside of the time you allot yourself to eat, you should only have water or coffee without cream or sugar. For more in-depth info, go check out the sub, it\u2019s super beginner friendly and they have a nice community centered around self improvement, with some insane success stories.\n\n-If you\u2019re looking for something else, also check out /r/CICO and /r/loseit, both being excellent subs for motivation, research, and providing friendly and accepting communities. Seriously, they\u2019re great.\n\n-Remember that weight loss is accomplished in the kitchen, muscles in the gym.\n\n-If you feel so inclined to check out the gym (I do, if that helps to motivate) check around in your local area for the best rates, location, setup, etc. I like to have a gym close to home to make it easy, but YMMV. Check out /r/weightlifting for good beginner guides and general advice for working out in the gym, /r/cardio for all the good stuff on running. Whichever avenue you choose, remember to start out slow and work your way up, a flame that\u2019s all tinder will burn bright, but only for a few seconds. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll of this information is now yours to do with what you like. You can heed my advice, heed the advice of others, or heed none at all and remain the same, the choice is up to you. You could remain entirely the same and live a fine life, but what if you did try? Just think about it. All of this info is just what I have gathered over the years and what has worked for me, and for that reason it isn\u2019t perfect. It may take some figuring out, but I am confident that you, too, could benefit. I wish you good luck, and hope to hear back from you in a bit on this sub with a before and after post, success stories are always great for those who haven\u2019t quite built up the confidence for posting.\n\n(Edited for clarity)",

I have social anxiety, so it actually took me about an hour to post a picture of myself on Reddit. As for Rogaine, I used it for about a year with little to no results, so I'm thinking a shorter haircut is gonna be my go-to. Hair loss runs in my family, so it was just a matter of time. As for using minox on my beard, it's not something I've thought of doing, but it's worth a shot. Finally, as for weight (the touchy subject that I don't mind discussing), I've actually been losing weight, slowly but surely. 60 pounds since July (from 330 to 270), and that's just from changing my diet. I think if I incorporated exercise, I would see more changes. However, I've been dealing with a disk issue in my lower back, and I have found it difficult to find workouts that don't leave me in pain. Although, I'm thinking just walking might help out to burn a couple extra calories (as soon as it's not so cold here in Wisconsin).",

Or go full on Dr. Phil. The hairs seem to be extremely thin and your hairline is very far back. \n\nFor the beard maybe allow the stache and chin to grow in fully and just do a short beard all around, edges trimmed regularly. However looking at the thinness of your cheek area for the beard, it seems thin as well, so... idk for the beard I guess. \n\nThis is just my opinion so see what others think as well and see what you can do.

Actually what I\u2019d recommend is this to improve the facial part of your beard, because I think you could look good with one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Minoxbeards/\n\nIn addition to thinning, the issue for the hair on top is that the sides are too long, that\u2019s not doing the thinning top part any favors. You could get away with buzzing the sides and using some American crew fiber to stick the top up a little bit and add some volume, but eventually you\u2019ll probably just have to buzz it. In fact, if you\u2019re using Minoxadil anyway for the beard, you might as well use it on top of your head and on your eyebrows. Might work wonders. So anyway, yeah you might be able to get a few more good years out of the hair on top if you\u2019re interested, but you\u2019ll want to style it every day after showering / blow-drying. Use a volumizing conditioner and the American crew fiber and see what happens.\n\nGlasses - I\u2019d recommend contacts or some black plastic rimmed glasses with some character, that say \u201cI\u2019m doing this on purpose\u201d. Just a personal opinion, though. I switch off between those and contacts day-to-day.\n\nGood luck, and as always, come back and show us the results so we can keep helping! :)",

As for using minox on my beard, it's not something I've thought of doing, but it's worth a shot. Finally, as for weight (the touchy subject that I don't mind discussing), I've actually been losing weight, slowly but surely. 60 pounds since July (from 330 to 270), and that's just from changing my diet. I think if I incorporated exercise, I would see more changes. However, I've been dealing with a disk issue in my lower back, and I have found it difficult to find workouts that don't leave me in pain. Although, I'm thinking just walking might help out to burn a couple extra calories (as soon as it's not so cold here in Wisconsin).",

More often than not, people end up with very generic looking square glasses that look like they are from the 90s. Good looking square glasses are much harder to find than good looking round glasses. For people who are just getting into assembling a fashionable look, they will have a much easier time finding a good looking pair of rounder glasses. Round glasses on a round face can look fantastic as well. \n\nAt any rate, he should get both. I just bought 4 pairs of prescription glasses from zenni, and the average cost was about $25. He should get a few varieties.",

I just wanted to say that it\u2019s fantastic to hear that you\u2019re already in the process of getting healthier, and I apologize for any offense (if any was incurred) over my assumption that you haven\u2019t already been trying. 330 to 270 is awesome, so I guess you probably don\u2019t need my help there, but I\u2019ll leave it up for others who may be in a similar situation to you but haven\u2019t posted. As for the disk injury, I\u2019d definitely say walking sounds like a great idea, it\u2019s low-impact and the rewards compound over time, so you\u2019re not rushing anything that shouldn\u2019t be rushed. Anyways, great job so far! Keep up the progress, work towards the hair, and you\u2019ll be feeling great about yourself in no time.",

My recommendation is to perform cardio exercises - which for me are swimming and cycling...both low impact cardio exercises and can get your heart rate up.  With the pool, you can progressively work your way up. Start by running in the pool, pushing floats underwater, and of course swimming laps.  For cycling, its all about your heart rate.  Just make sure you\u2019re working and not taking a lazy stroll.",
