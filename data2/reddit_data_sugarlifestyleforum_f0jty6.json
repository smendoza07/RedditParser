    "body": "After what feels like forever, I finally met my POT SB again today. After our M&G last Friday, we made plans for this Saturday (tomorrow) but couldn\u2019t wait till then. She happened to be in my suburbs today and I was bored at work and so we decided to hang out at my apartment.\n\nBeautiful things happened (lol) and I knew for sure that I wanted to make her my SB.\n\nWhen she had to leave, I walked her to her car and we held hands all the way there. It felt liberating to be able to hold hands with a girl, have my arm around her waist and kiss her in public. I hope she\u2019ll be the one to help me come out one day.\n\nAfter she left, I actually texted her with \u201cWill you be my SB?\u201d And she said Yes! lol I\u2019m gonna die from being cringeworthy as hell.\n\nMy queer SB is cute, sexy, hot, communicates well and is actually eager to meet me as many times she could. It helps that she grew up in my suburbs and still has family out here so it\u2019s nothing out of her way.\n\nI\u2019m truly excited for this SR \ud83d\ude0a",
