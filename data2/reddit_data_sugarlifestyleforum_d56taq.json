    "body": "My out of town SB that I see from time to time, yet we chat a few times a week asked for a little $ recently and said she\u2019d pay me back when she got paid. \n\nI send her $ quite often for whatever, nails, drinks with her friends, help with a bill, just the hell of it, etc.  This ask for some reason she said she\u2019d pay me back. I didn\u2019t respond to that part but sent the $ happily. \n\nSaturday lo and behold I got a Venmo notification and there was the money. \n\nI immediately sent it back with a lengthy Thank You note. \n\nShe texted me not long after telling me to take the money back, that everything was fine now. I thanked her again and told her everything IS fine and I appreciated her paying it back. But now she has everything in order plus a few extra dollars to enjoy. \n\nGirls like this, living up to their word and being so kind, are what I love most about life.",
