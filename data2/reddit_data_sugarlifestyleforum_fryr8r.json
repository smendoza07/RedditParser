Because many SDs have learned from experience that many/most curvy girls list themselves as average or athletic, and the Curvy category is filled with women who should have chosen A Few Pounds Extra or Overweight.   It's preference.  Just like so many SBs choose SDs who can offer $X allowance and might avoid those who can only offer $X/5 (not just avoid them, in many cases, but run around calling them splenda)",

Once in a while, I'll uncheck slim and search Athletic only, and go through the \"athletes\" on a case-by-case basis to find the needles in a haystack as many abuse the \"Athletic\" category.\n\n*Successful Athletic Encounters:*\n\n* SB1-Athletic (24) - A former college athlete disclosed on the profile; determined to be an NCAA tennis player.\n\n* SB2-Athletic (26) - A former NCAA fencer (fencing scholarship);  Recently traveled to Milan, Italy for an international fencing competition.\n\n* SB3-Athletic (23) - A former ballerina.\n\n* SB4-Athletic (21) - Hiphop dancer/choreographer\n\nAll of the above have been successful experiences.",
