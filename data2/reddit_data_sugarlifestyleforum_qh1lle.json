    "body": "First of all I\u2019ll love to point out the double standards that \u2018sugar daddies\u2019 on Reddit seem to have when it comes to sugar relationships. The comments [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/qgqzbv/ppm_and_time_spent/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) talking about the sugar baby being escorty because she times her dates but in my opinion it\u2019s you SDs that treat the sugar babies like escorts the way you dole out allowances or should I say PPMs  based on the degree of intimacy. \n\nYou keep saying that Sugar dasing isn\u2019t vanilla so why do you insist on doing everything like it\u2019s a vanilla relationship at least the only thing that favours you. Most of your sugar babies have not future with you, the relationship might never progress so why do you insist on draining her energy for a relationship that\u2019s honestly really transactional( I honestly don\u2019t care if you love each other or not, it\u2019s still transactional). Also I\u2019ll like to add that the biggest lie I\u2019ve heard so far is that you don\u2019t have to be wealthy to be a sugar daddy, well that\u2019s a load of crap because you have no problem telling these poor girls that their value as an SB is based on their physical appearance so why are you salty when women prefer men with larger pockets. I\u2019m glad women are waking up and realizing what being in a sugar relationship entails and aren\u2019t taking the bare minimum from men who want to live out their provider fantasies whilst working on a limited budget. \n\nYou claim to be secure in your masculinity as a sugar daddy but you convulse at the thought of another man sending gifts on [SA](It means \u201csucker\u2026 attention all rinsers and scammers, contact this man immediately!\u201d) \nYou claim to be ready to provide in a sugar relationship but can\u2019t even gift a young woman two hundred dollars for getting ready to see you at a m&g. If we\u2019re just being honest, a lot of you are just too broke to afford actual escorts and a sugar relationship is your next best bet.  So girls take note of this and don\u2019t give up any sugar to any man who sees you as a walking sex doll. Stay safe and stop entertaining stingy men \ud83d\ude18\n\nP.s because I know what the comments are going to look like already \n1. This is not my personal first hand experience- I wouldn\u2019t tolerate such \n2. I\u2019m in a sugar relationship already and always looking out for something better so no I\u2019m not burnt out \n3. I\u2019m not bitter, men lack the ability to make me so.\n4. I\u2019m in no way saying rinsing is okay but some of you men have found a way to twist the meaning of the word, like do you even know what it means at this point? \n5. Also ladies don\u2019t be scared to be called an escort or a rinser by these men, they throw those words so carelessly that it hardly has meaning anymore. As long as you\u2019re a woman who expects more from a Sugar daddy you\u2019re suddenly an escort or a rinser.",

            "body": "I want to preface this by saying everyone deserves respect up front, regardless of if they are an escort or a SB. The umbrella of sex work is vast, and imo includes sugaring. \n\nSDs can absolutely behave like johns. That does happen. That does not negate the fact that the referenced post is showcasing an SB who is much more escort like. Having a hard stop of 2 hour dates is truly pay per hour.  Call a spade a spade. \n\nNow there\u2019s nothing wrong with this if she finds someone it meshes with. It\u2019s their prerogative. The problem is when the two people don\u2019t align.\n\nBoth parties have people who behave in this fashion, and it\u2019s as simple as nexting them if it\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for. This forum is comprised of a lot men that are looking for that relationship feel, so it\u2019s created an echo chamber. I think it\u2019s really silly to generalize unless you\u2019re going to pull up individual comments that are \u201cJohn like\u201d of those people who complained about \u201cescort like\u201d  behaviour in the thread (or others) to point out hypocrisy. Otherwise you\u2019re kind of shouting into the void. \n\nI see a lot of men here who pay allowance if they don\u2019t see their SB or if they don\u2019t get intimacy, so I guess I\u2019m just not drawing a parallel with this forum to what you\u2019re saying. M&G in my opinion shouldn\u2019t be paid, so we won\u2019t agree there anyway, but for the rest I think you\u2019re being a little hyperbolic on the representation of the forum. \n\nAlso, larger pockets does not equate to more generosity. I don\u2019t think anyone here would be annoyed you want someone who has more money, they would just tell you that it may not translate how you want it to.",

They flood the bowl and drag PPMs down and allow SDs to do the least and get the most. The SBs in communities like this, just by nature of taking the time to engage and learn, are outliers. The majority of SBs never come across a forum like this or any sort of community. Or they only see the platonic/online-only girls, realize that's not reality, and then either quit accept horrible treatment because they don't know that better is possible. \n\nThere's also a lot more SBs than SDs. So even if some portion of SBs are standing strong and demanding more, there are still plenty who will take their place. \n\nSDs are almost entirely in control of the bowl at large because of these dynamics. So of course they use it to their favor. And it's not even malicious - they're just doing what's \"normal\".",

Maybe they're super entitled because of their money or women with low self esteem (or perhaps just naive) have allowed them to become this way... Rich in the bank, but poor in matters of the heart.\n\nSpeaking from my perspective, SDs have a responsibility to be a provider and that means both emotional and monetary. This is what our experience and financial privilege affords us. Even if you're having a bad day, your struggles are microscopic compared to the struggles of a young SB trying to improve her life and reach her life goals.\n\nIt's quite sad to see SDs use their experience to take advantage rather than truly uplift their SBs as partners. This toxic behavior is what causes so many people to become jaded and disillusioned...\n\nFinal words: There's jaded, broke, lonely, and burned out people on both sides.

I get that it is frustrating and difficult to find someone online that cares for *your* well-being and takes *your* best interests to heart before their own. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's the same experience for SDs. We have a hard time finding generous women who will be affectionate, loving, and kind before asking for the moolah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEscorting imho is far less expensive than sugar-dating, both financially and emotionally. YMMV and it depends if you are looking for 'standard' escorts (who are largely high-volume providers) around three benjamins per hour or if you are going after the top 0.001% escorts who can be ten+ benjamins per hour.\n\nA sugar-baby, on the other hand, takes care, attention, thoughtfulness, as well as ongoing financial support. They are two completely different ways of pay-for-play and I believe those who prefer sugar-babies are those who *want* all the extra stuff -- that you cannot get from emotionally unavailable escorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you'd understand a little more if you could see both sides of the equation. Many SDs are torn between their love of youthful women and their thriftiness (a trait that inherently increases your chances of ever becoming wealthy enough to be a SD). Now there are of course exceptions, and once you reach a certain amount of money most people relax their purse strings. But take a look at Warren Buffett. Stingy as fuck! This guy is a multi-billionaire and last I checked he still eats at McDs for breakfast, has no chauffeur, and considers the house he bought 50+ years ago to be his most reckless and wasteful purchase ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWealth does not equate to generosity. You can find a middle-class SD willing to go broke to sustain a SR for several years, and you can find a whale who doesn't want to spend a dime over what's necessary to string you along.",

I don't know why any dude would get angry at the thought of men buying women they don't know gifts, that seems strange. Maybe you wouldn't do it, but lots of us wouldn't do lots of things. Just don't do it yourself and live and let live.  However, it's important to remember that gifting without meeting is rare, most guys want sex, in person.\n\nAs for paid M&G, same again, except this does involve the sugar babies time and she is the one without the wealth. I think some form of compensation, travel expense, dinner paid for at least is fair. And again, if some sugar babies want to be paid for M&G, that's their right, especially if we're gonna say, it's sugar daddy's right to meet a girl, then say \"oh I didn't like her in person.\" That's his right, we wouldn't argue it, so as long as SBs make it clear that DO expect to be paid for the M&G no SD should be getting angry at this.

There is a website called WYP that if appropriate for girls that want to be compensated for vanilla dates or meet and greets.  That\u2019s a more appropriate place for some young ladies and some ladies are on both sites.  SA has customs that have changed over time as rinsing because more common.  The behavior of the girls facilitated that change,  not the SD\u2019s.  For every action there is a reaction and many of the customs you don\u2019t like are due to behavior by the SB\u2019s.  If you have a full month allowance on first or second meeting they would disappear or become incredibly busy until the first of the month.  It\u2019s human behavior and it\u2019s why most employers pay weekly or biweekly\u2026 it would be less expensive and move convenient for all companies to pay once a month,  but human nature makes that impossible. \n\nHuman nature has caused early arrangement to be a bit more Transactional than we would all like.

There are a boat load of scammers on both sides.  Why would a girl meet anybody if she could get dozens of men sending her \u201ca few hundred dollars\u201d to get ready for a meet and greet.  Now for a second date after you have met,  that\u2019s a guys judgement call.  \n\nEscorts are much less expensive than sugar baby\u2019s in my area (SF).  Obviously it\u2019s a much different experience but it is 50-60% less than a weekly allowance.  Also zero time commitment or communication.  \n\nFinancially,  if a guy can afford an extra fifteen to two grand then he can be a legit sugar daddy in the right situation.  That can cover rent and a budget car payment or a chunk of tuition in most areas.  Does a guy need to be really wealthy to spend that kind of excess cash?  I don\u2019t think so.  \n\nI have been at this thirteen years,  dozens of SB\u2019s,  hundreds of m&g\u2019s,  7 figures plus in allowance\u2026 been through damn near every situation I can imagine including a SB dying,  a POT killing someone else,  and everything in between\u2026 I love it when an early 20\u2019s girl that\u2019s been doing this for 47 days is trying to tell me what a \u201creal SD\u201d is.

I usually prefer PPM, based on the fact that I travel a lot and the regularity of get-togethers is quite varying, however I also consider myself pretty generous and like to take care of someone that I'm in a relationship with.   I don't imagine many people are communicating with, or sending escorts gifts between seeing them.  \n\nFor me, that's just all part of having a really good relationship.  I want my SB to know how I feel about them, and feel like she's being taken care of.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I have nothing against any kind of sex worker -- I have friends that are sex-workers, it's just not something that interests me.",

I\u2019m not saying every single SD has to pay for the company of a younger woman, some do it for other reasons, but 90% do. Most SDs wouldn\u2019t be in the company of a young beautiful woman who is interested in him otherwise. So yes, they\u2019ll compensate a SB just for her time and attention. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re paying 1k for dinner and drinks. Or that they\u2019re paying a full allowance for a M&G. Or that they\u2019re having arrangements with no intimacy. But there are SDs who are compensating SBs for M&Gs. Don\u2019t let this forum fool you. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
