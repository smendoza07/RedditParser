I know my allowance I offer on my area is extremely fair, but it does not stop women from insulting me when I have the discussion with them.\n\nAgain, just move on. If you have higher expectations and you want to wait for that whale, more power to you, but don\u2019t insult me or for that matter other SBs who do lower allowances than you.",

The \"no negotiation\" crowd is definitely pretty universally guilty of this.\n\nI usually name my offer first.  But if an SB makes her request first, and it's more than I can offer but relatively close, I always explain to her that the most I can offer is $X.  Likewise, sometimes I make an offer and the SB requests a little more, and I accept it or not.  I have had fantastic SRs result from this.   You \"no negotiation\" types, keep doing it -- more SBs for me :)  I actually don't even really think of it as a negotiation, since I'm not looking for a winner and loser, just to see if we can come to a support level we're both happy with.\n\nIf you're a \"take it or leave, no negotiation \"type, that's great.  It's not better or worse than anything else, it's just a personal choice you've made, that you shouldn't tell the rest of us is the one right way to go.  It's definitively not.",

This forum, although it admittedly may not be representative of the real world, is chock-full of career women with their lives completely together who simply want to add to their already flourishing life. They should not have to defend themselves yet again so I shall do it for them. I also think there are basically two camps of sugaring. There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups. It does not mean anyone is less than or better than anyone else.",

What an SD offers doesn't define her \"value\" or \"worth\".   The reason people take this so personally is because they tie it into people and market value.  I just think it's way healthier to conceptualize this as: she has a level of financial support she wants or needs (which does not reflect her value as a person or the SD's value), the SD has a level of financial of support he can afford and would like to offer.  They match or they don't.\n\nI think the \"market value\" SDs and \"this is my worth\" SBs deserve each other.  Ironic that two sides of the same coin hate each other so much",

When I\u2019ve tried to tell women in the past on here that perhaps if they run into this their expectations are above norms, and not that the guy is cheap, they tend to blow up and call me a salt daddy.\n\nThere also tends to be a lot of older SBs on here that don\u2019t seem to understand that men on seeking in general are looking for the 25 and under crowd. Yes, you will find guys looking for older women, but most guys frankly are interested in the younger SBs. Just a reality. The thread that this is in response to has a long line of SBs in their 30\u2019s complaining about guys that look for women under 25 and saying they get \u201cEpstein vibes\u201d from those guys. It is nothing more than being jaded in a ton of cases.\n\nRead this chain...it\u2019s pretty freaking ridiculous.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/jwlfgk/stop_arguing_with_sbs_whove_stated_their_worth/gcqwvcf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

So you have a huge number of sbs looking for that whale when theres just not enough to go around. Granted, desirable women wont usually have too much issues, but those sds are snatched up pretty quickly. the majority of successful srs are operating at lower allowances than people would like to admit, with a few at the top raking it in. It's all an illusion on youtube. You shouldn't ever agree to a number you aren't comfortable with. And most sbs never find that perfect long term sd.",

Likewise, sometimes I make an offer and the SB requests a little more, and I accept it or not.  I have had fantastic SRs result from this.   You \"no negotiation\" types, keep doing it -- more SBs for me :)  I actually don't even really think of it as a negotiation, since I'm not looking for a winner and loser, just to see if we can come to a support level we're both happy with.\n\nIf you're a \"take it or leave, no negotiation \"type, that's great.

This forum, although it admittedly may not be representative of the real world, is chock-full of career women with their lives completely together who simply want to add to their already flourishing life. They should not have to defend themselves yet again so I shall do it for them. I also think there are basically two camps of sugaring. There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups. It does not mean anyone is less than or better than anyone else.",

We are all humans, with different values to different  people.\n\nI agree, but just think that doesn't go far enough.  The allowance an SB asks for isn't her \"worth\".  What an SD offers doesn't define her \"value\" or \"worth\".   The reason people take this so personally is because they tie it into people and market value.  I just think it's way healthier to conceptualize this as: she has a level of financial support she wants or needs (which does not reflect her value as a person or the SD's value), the SD has a level of financial of support he can afford and would like to offer.  They match or they don't.\n\nI think the \"market value\" SDs and \"this is my worth\" SBs deserve each other.  Ironic that two sides of the same coin hate each other so much",

This forum, although it admittedly may not be representative of the real world, is chock-full of career women with their lives completely together who simply want to add to their already flourishing life. They should not have to defend themselves yet again so I shall do it for them. I also think there are basically two camps of sugaring. There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups. It does not mean anyone is less than or better than anyone else.",

Didn\u2019t work at a job, she worked as a SB.  \n\nShe was drop dead gorgeous, worked out everyday, booked all our hotels & dinner dates. \n\nShe always scheduled at least one weekly date and was always there before I arrived.  \n\nThe definition of a whale for the other 95% ++ is : \n\nYour second to last sentence, last paragraph of your comment.  \n\nEvery SB wants that and these exceptional SDs are unfortunately pretty rare. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\n\nWithout being able to put a number on it, \u201cgenerous\u201d is in the eye of the beholder, but caring  for & wanting to better your SBs life is not in the eye of the beholder and should be expected by every SB.",

Teen is the most popular porn genre yet they\u2019re all legal age (supposedly)\n\nMen only like me because they think they can manipulate me easier due to lack of life experience, compared to an older more age appropriate SB who has a fully developed bullshit radar. \n\nI had an SD give a very generous amount a week plus gifts and was insulted I refused to meet again. He INSISTED I call him \u201cDaddy\u201d in a childlike tone and encouraged me to be more immature (the term he used was \u201cloose\u201d) \n\nI am very happy this is being discussed publicly because I\u2019ve only had mature discussions like these privately amongst other sex workers in general",

We are all humans, with different values to different  people.\n\nI agree, but just think that doesn't go far enough.  The allowance an SB asks for isn't her \"worth\".  What an SD offers doesn't define her \"value\" or \"worth\".   The reason people take this so personally is because they tie it into people and market value.  I just think it's way healthier to conceptualize this as: she has a level of financial support she wants or needs (which does not reflect her value as a person or the SD's value), the SD has a level of financial of support he can afford and would like to offer.  They match or they don't.\n\nI think the \"market value\" SDs and \"this is my worth\" SBs deserve each other.  Ironic that two sides of the same coin hate each other so much",

When I\u2019ve tried to tell women in the past on here that perhaps if they run into this their expectations are above norms, and not that the guy is cheap, they tend to blow up and call me a salt daddy.\n\nThere also tends to be a lot of older SBs on here that don\u2019t seem to understand that men on seeking in general are looking for the 25 and under crowd. Yes, you will find guys looking for older women, but most guys frankly are interested in the younger SBs. Just a reality. The thread that this is in response to has a long line of SBs in their 30\u2019s complaining about guys that look for women under 25 and saying they get \u201cEpstein vibes\u201d from those guys. It is nothing more than being jaded in a ton of cases.\n\nRead this chain...it\u2019s pretty freaking ridiculous.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/jwlfgk/stop_arguing_with_sbs_whove_stated_their_worth/gcqwvcf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

This forum, although it admittedly may not be representative of the real world, is chock-full of career women with their lives completely together who simply want to add to their already flourishing life. They should not have to defend themselves yet again so I shall do it for them. I also think there are basically two camps of sugaring. There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups.

Definitely. \n\nExamples-\n\nOne of my favorite old sages on here loves the \u201cbad girl\u201d vibe.  Typically they have a different tilt to them. \n\nOne of my favorite SBs on here is 20 (?).  She used to be a dancer.  She totally knows what\u2019s up.   \n\nBut at the end of the day if your motto is \u201cthe younger the better\u201d or \u201c30 is too old\u201d then deal with the massive amount of drama & BS that comes along with your decision, don\u2019t whiny ass post about it.  \n\nI know I\u2019m ranting but I\u2019m really not ranting at you.  \n\nI just can\u2019t stand the entitled BS, the difference is it should be expected from a young girl, not a SD.",

This forum, although it admittedly may not be representative of the real world, is chock-full of career women with their lives completely together who simply want to add to their already flourishing life. They should not have to defend themselves yet again so I shall do it for them. I also think there are basically two camps of sugaring. There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups.

Definitely. \n\nExamples-\n\nOne of my favorite old sages on here loves the \u201cbad girl\u201d vibe.  Typically they have a different tilt to them. \n\nOne of my favorite SBs on here is 20 (?).  She used to be a dancer.  She totally knows what\u2019s up.   \n\nBut at the end of the day if your motto is \u201cthe younger the better\u201d or \u201c30 is too old\u201d then deal with the massive amount of drama & BS that comes along with your decision, don\u2019t whiny ass post about it.  \n\nI know I\u2019m ranting but I\u2019m really not ranting at you.  \n\nI just can\u2019t stand the entitled BS, the difference is it should be expected from a young girl, not a SD.",

This forum, although it admittedly may not be representative of the real world, is chock-full of career women with their lives completely together who simply want to add to their already flourishing life. They should not have to defend themselves yet again so I shall do it for them. I also think there are basically two camps of sugaring. There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups.

There are those who firmly believe in a strict PPM style arrangement and those who others call \"whales or whale searchers.\" These two camps generally passionately believe their way of sugaring is the ethical or right way and so there are constant clashes between the two groups.

My question for you is if whale hunters are generally delusional young girls or professional SBs then what are whales? Whales being SDs (or SMs) who believe a real SD should be extremely generous and try to improve their SBs life as much as they reasonably can. Also, I agree that legitimate SBs know better than to be derogatory towards a legitimate POT SD.",

Didn\u2019t work at a job, she worked as a SB.  \n\nShe was drop dead gorgeous, worked out everyday, booked all our hotels & dinner dates. \n\nShe always scheduled at least one weekly date and was always there before I arrived.  \n\nThe definition of a whale for the other 95% ++ is : \n\nYour second to last sentence, last paragraph of your comment.  \n\nEvery SB wants that and these exceptional SDs are unfortunately pretty rare. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\n\nWithout being able to put a number on it, \u201cgenerous\u201d is in the eye of the beholder, but caring  for & wanting to better your SBs life is not in the eye of the beholder and should be expected by every SB.",

Didn\u2019t work at a job, she worked as a SB.  \n\nShe was drop dead gorgeous, worked out everyday, booked all our hotels & dinner dates. \n\nShe always scheduled at least one weekly date and was always there before I arrived.  \n\nThe definition of a whale for the other 95% ++ is : \n\nYour second to last sentence, last paragraph of your comment.  \n\nEvery SB wants that and these exceptional SDs are unfortunately pretty rare. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\n\nWithout being able to put a number on it, \u201cgenerous\u201d is in the eye of the beholder, but caring  for & wanting to better your SBs life is not in the eye of the beholder and should be expected by every SB.",
