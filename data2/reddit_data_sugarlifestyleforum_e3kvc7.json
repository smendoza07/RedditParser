    "body": "So, I am bar hopping with my SB. We are walking toward this bar that has watermelon martinis, on a beautiful night in Hollywood.  As we round a corner, this younger guy looks right at me, and says: \"Hey baby.\"  Look, I'm already two pineapple punches in, and it's a nice night. I don't know him, but I say \"hey baby,\" right back at him.  You know, just chill, like this happens to me all the time.  We walk past each other and he gives me this crazy look. Turns out, he was talking to some female who was absolutely silently behind me. Like, this chick trains ninjas, or something. I did what any honorable man would do, and actively hoped my SB didn't hear me say \"Hey baby.\"\n#\nSo she definitely heard me say it. My watermelon martini was significantly delayed because we had to stand there while she laughed at me. Seems like she could have waited till we got to the bar and there could have been some multi-tasking. Her advice was that I don't say \"hey baby\" to random men \"even if they started it.\"  \n#\nCome on. I'm the victim here. You don't just go in and drop a \"hey baby\" grenade into a crowded room and get upset by whoever flirts with you. I'm a nerd. In that moment, it was the one and only time I have ever been catcalled in my whole life. *I am going to own that shit when it happens*.  Sorry if I don't get so much practice at being objectified that I know the perfect Justin Bieber thing to say when it happens.",
