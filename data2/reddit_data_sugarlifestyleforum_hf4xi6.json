    "body": "I guess we're SBF/SGF now. :)\n\nShe's madly in love with me, and I, her.\n\nI had a talk with my wife and we're (currently) splitting amicably. She's fallen out of love with me just like I have with her.  She said she wants to keep it civil because she doesn't want to have to fight for alimony.  I agreed and then we both agreed on an allowance for her to live off of.\n\nI drew up paperwork and we both went to a notary and signed it.\n\nSo, we're working on separating out lives now as I move onto a new chapter...\n\nLife marches on!",

Sleeping in different beds but living together for the sake of our young children. We have 2 year old twins on top of our older two who are all younger than 10. So it is beneficial for us to all live together unless we were involved with someone else at this point. Then there is no need for the kids to live without either parent which can be traumatic",

I'm going through something like that and probably wont feel the need to file for an actual divorce unless I've found someone else. Sleeping in different beds but living together for the sake of our young children. We have 2 year old twins on top of our older two who are all younger than 10. So it is beneficial for us to all live together unless we were involved with someone else at this point. Then there is no need for the kids to live without either parent which can be traumatic",
