    "body": "Recently, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of profiles where SD are saying things like \u201cnot interested is giving $$$, but I\u2019m a mentor and that\u2019s more valuable\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t use $$$, I show my appreciation by mentorship or dinner\u201d, all while bragging in their bios about being rich and successful. The last couple of weeks, so many of the pot SD have messaged me have this in their bio or say this once the conversation turns into a discussion of expectations and money. Not to mention EVERY SINGLE ONE has something about kinks, being a dom/seeking a sub, BDSM, or something very sex-oriented. Is it just me or are other SB noticing an influx of these type of men?",

They can't actually afford an SD, or aren't actually planning on meeting anyone, but they're getting off (probably literally) on the idea of having an SB.\n\nBut, back when I had the time and money to be an SD, I was surprised to find that three times, I met up with a potential SB who refused to take my money. I really couldn't get my mind around it. In all three cases, as well as with every other girl I met up with, it was clear up front that I would be paying. I never went to any of these meetings with the intention or idea that I wouldn't be paying.\n\nThere must be more girls out there who are not doing this for the money, and the fact that it happened three times (I maybe met up with 12-15 girls over around a 5 year period) tells me that they're not all that rare. So some of these guys might just be guys that clued into this somehow, and are now looking for girls like that.\n\nWhat's stupid though is that that is not how I found those girls. I found those girls because I was looking for an SB in good faith. I always made it clear that I was expecting to pay, and always met up with girls both expecting and willing to pay for the meeting. If a girl changed her mind and decided she didn't want to take my money, I wasn't going to complain, but I strongly suspect that I would never have found or connected with them if I'd tried to just offer dinner and mentorship.\n\n(Also, this is very much not some sort of brag about how I do sex so good that they give me a freebie or something, in none of the cases was it like that at all.)",

That is a fantasy as this pretty never happens but what does happen is predatory men taking advantage of the newbies. And even if there are women on SA who want a vanilla relationship, there are plenty of millionaire match making sites. These sites have a strict policy of no sugar babies. Why cannot people who are looking for an SR have 1 site that isn\u2019t filled with vanillas or scammers? Just one site.",

The \u201cmentoring\u201d, it just comes across as a man who wants to mansplain and feel important, and somehow thinks that entitles him to a hot sugar babe. Especially as badly the time these guys aren\u2019t yet successful in their career, or have careers that couldn\u2019t help anyone else.\n\nSo recently a guy messaged me. He\u2019d contacted me a few years before and when it was clear he wasn\u2019t offering an allowance I said no. This time I was horny and he happened to mention being into the exact same kink I\u2019m into. So I met up with him and actually there was good chemistry so we started dating casually. The funny thing is, he\u2019d mentioned how he\u2019d had an SB before and took her for dinners, got her gifts etc. Well, I wasn\u2019t sleeping with him for that, but he\u2019s made zero offer of it. I even sent him links of kink related stuff, and I even bought a few items. He has made no offer to reimburse me or buy me anything. \nI like him as a friend and he lives nearby so I don\u2019t mind for sex when I\u2019m horny. But I know he only uses SA because he doesn\u2019t do well on dating apps and girls are more open to kink on SA. I\u2019ve encountered a few like this. With him he\u2019s young and decent looking so gets away with it. But I\u2019ve spoken to married dudes in their 50s who don\u2019t want to provide an allowance. Like, what else are they giving me? I don\u2019t want someone else\u2019s ideas of gifts, and I can get dinner bought for me by pretty much anyone.",

I got taken to amazing restaurants by men, not men who were too old or physically unattractive either as I didn\u2019t know at the time you could get an allowance I was only basing it off potential chemistry. And I realised that you can go to the nicest restaurant ever, but if the company isn\u2019t that which you\u2019d choose it\u2019s meaningless. No, please give me money so that if I want to, I can go to one of these places with my friends. Of course, I don\u2019t, I\u2019d far rather do other things with my money than go for a pretentious meal out. So why would I lower my standards of men just for the fancy restaurant, to be pressured into sex early (I received several angry post date messages for not putting out), just so they can make themselves feel important by \u201cmentoring\u201d me? It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get a dude I\u2019m actually into to take me out to places, although in non sugar I always aim to split the bill.",

I don't need to be paid on top of it, just that.  \n\n\nWhen you're a starving university student who's living on junk food and fending off advances from immature frat boys, an evening of sophistication doesn't sound bad. But of course it's important to note that I've never gone out fishing for that... rather, it's found me \"organically\".  \n\n\nAs per all the comments below, these guys are all either legitimately trying to treat SA as a conventional dating site (with a typically higher quality of women to choose from) or they're playing out fantasies. Either way, it's unfortunately a huge waste of time, and somewhat difficult to avoid I guess.   \n\n\nBut advice to SBs who are in it for the money (which is of course most of them) -- don't be afraid to broach this subject sooner than later. If the guy is a legit POT, he'll happily engage the discussion. This isn't conventional dating where you have to play some \"get to know you\" games and endless texts and calls. Be upfront about what you want, and do it sooner than later... for your benefit. So you don't waste time. The aforementioned guys are here to waste your time, and will string you along as long as you let them.",

Why would I want to do every day things with guys online for free that I can do on my own or with friends? \n\nAlso, even with the original launch about me, my point still stands. Who would want to date someone wealthy with not even receiving gifts or having a bill paid or something? I can do that with someone my age, my with a wealthy man that isn\u2019t generous? Doesn\u2019t make sense. The point of the website is for attractive, young women, that would typical be out of reach due to age, connect with wealthy men. Money is what ties it all together. \n\nI completely understand that a meal at Applebee\u2019s is great for some, but not me. \n\nI never did PPM, I always had allowances that could increase depending on what was going on that month (an extra trip so new clothes, extra money since the semester is starting for books, etc).",

They can't actually afford an SD, or aren't actually planning on meeting anyone, but they're getting off (probably literally) on the idea of having an SB.\n\nBut, back when I had the time and money to be an SD, I was surprised to find that three times, I met up with a potential SB who refused to take my money. I really couldn't get my mind around it. In all three cases, as well as with every other girl I met up with, it was clear up front that I would be paying. I never went to any of these meetings with the intention or idea that I wouldn't be paying.\n\nThere must be more girls out there who are not doing this for the money, and the fact that it happened three times (I maybe met up with 12-15 girls over around a 5 year period) tells me that they're not all that rare. So some of these guys might just be guys that clued into this somehow, and are now looking for girls like that.\n\nWhat's stupid though is that that is not how I found those girls. I found those girls because I was looking for an SB in good faith. I always made it clear that I was expecting to pay, and always met up with girls both expecting and willing to pay for the meeting. If a girl changed her mind and decided she didn't want to take my money, I wasn't going to complain, but I strongly suspect that I would never have found or connected with them if I'd tried to just offer dinner and mentorship.\n\n(Also, this is very much not some sort of brag about how I do sex so good that they give me a freebie or something, in none of the cases was it like that at all.)",

And even if there are women on SA who want a vanilla relationship, there are plenty of millionaire match making sites. These sites have a strict policy of no sugar babies.

And I\u2019ve played that game, you talk about chemistry, attraction, not being an escort etc. And it is different, you get choice, you get a connection with one person. But it is largely a game.

Going to Applebee\u2019s with a 50+ year old doesn\u2019t make sense to me when I can do that with a guy my age and still not have to pay. Getting away from dorm food was never an issue for me while in undergrad and still isn\u2019t in graduate school. Why would I want to do every day things with guys online for free that I can do on my own or with friends? \n\nAlso, even with the original launch about me, my point still stands. Who would want to date someone wealthy with not even receiving gifts or having a bill paid or something? I can do that with someone my age, my with a wealthy man that isn\u2019t generous? Doesn\u2019t make sense. The point of the website is for attractive, young women, that would typical be out of reach due to age, connect with wealthy men. Money is what ties it all together. \n\nI completely understand that a meal at Applebee\u2019s is great for some, but not me. \n\nI never did PPM, I always had allowances that could increase depending on what was going on that month (an extra trip so new clothes, extra money since the semester is starting for books, etc).",

That is a fantasy as this pretty never happens but what does happen is predatory men taking advantage of the newbies.

And I\u2019ve played that game, you talk about chemistry, attraction, not being an escort etc. And it is different, you get choice, you get a connection with one person. But it is largely a game. You get some girls who are new to it and still learning what they can get, but in the end, I think we\u2019re all wanting that financial support.

I got taken to amazing restaurants by men, not men who were too old or physically unattractive either as I didn\u2019t know at the time you could get an allowance I was only basing it off potential chemistry. And I realised that you can go to the nicest restaurant ever, but if the company isn\u2019t that which you\u2019d choose it\u2019s meaningless. No, please give me money so that if I want to, I can go to one of these places with my friends. Of course, I don\u2019t, I\u2019d far rather do other things with my money than go for a pretentious meal out. So why would I lower my standards of men just for the fancy restaurant, to be pressured into sex early (I received several angry post date messages for not putting out), just so they can make themselves feel important by \u201cmentoring\u201d me? It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get a dude I\u2019m actually into to take me out to places, although in non sugar I always aim to split the bill.",

Why would I want to do every day things with guys online for free that I can do on my own or with friends? \n\nAlso, even with the original launch about me, my point still stands. Who would want to date someone wealthy with not even receiving gifts or having a bill paid or something? I can do that with someone my age, my with a wealthy man that isn\u2019t generous? Doesn\u2019t make sense. The point of the website is for attractive, young women, that would typical be out of reach due to age, connect with wealthy men. Money is what ties it all together. \n\nI completely understand that a meal at Applebee\u2019s is great for some, but not me. \n\nI never did PPM, I always had allowances that could increase depending on what was going on that month (an extra trip so new clothes, extra money since the semester is starting for books, etc).",

I guess then I thought maybe a rich boyfriend was the way to go.\n\nSA is in my opinion a sex work site pretending not to be, where men can buy sex while being convinced they aren\u2019t. And I\u2019ve played that game, you talk about chemistry, attraction, not being an escort etc. And it is different, you get choice, you get a connection with one person. But it is largely a game. You get some girls who are new to it and still learning what they can get, but in the end, I think we\u2019re all wanting that financial support. Knowing how much I stroke men\u2019s egos as part of being a good SB, I honestly can\u2019t take much seriously that SDs say about SBs wants and needs. You have no idea what\u2019s going on in our heads, because you\u2019re paying for the fakeness. You\u2019re paying for something perfect. You\u2019re paying for the fantasy.",

Going to Applebee\u2019s with a 50+ year old doesn\u2019t make sense to me when I can do that with a guy my age and still not have to pay. Getting away from dorm food was never an issue for me while in undergrad and still isn\u2019t in graduate school. Why would I want to do every day things with guys online for free that I can do on my own or with friends? \n\nAlso, even with the original launch about me, my point still stands. Who would want to date someone wealthy with not even receiving gifts or having a bill paid or something? I can do that with someone my age, my with a wealthy man that isn\u2019t generous? Doesn\u2019t make sense. The point of the website is for attractive, young women, that would typical be out of reach due to age, connect with wealthy men. Money is what ties it all together. \n\nI completely understand that a meal at Applebee\u2019s is great for some, but not me. \n\nI never did PPM, I always had allowances that could increase depending on what was going on that month (an extra trip so new clothes, extra money since the semester is starting for books, etc).",
