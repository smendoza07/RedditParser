Both are much more flattering than the angle and hair part in the right photo. The left angle looks like a portrait, while the right angle looks very accidental selfie. The left part looks styled, while the right part looks messy. \n\nSo if you greatly prefer to keep your beard shorter, I think that\u2019s okay. The left is a bit nicer, but I think the other changes between pictures make more of an impact.",

I feel if u grew out the hair on ur head for a bit and got some volume, it would look amazing with the shorter beard. However, with ur current hair, maybe a mix of both, like shorter than the long beard, but a little longer than the short one. So it looks like you rocking a fine ass beard, but it doesn't seem like too much. once again, this is my opinion, you don't have to agree.",
