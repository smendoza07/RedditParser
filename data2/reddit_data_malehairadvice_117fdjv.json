What I'd reccomend is no shave november when that comes around - it's long enough to get a better image of where you're at. In a couple years if your think your growth is ok, try letting it grow for 6 weeks - iirc facial hair doesnt actually grow all at the same time, so when you grow it out for two weeks and then shave, that's a different set of hairs having their growth period - 6 weeks should be good to get a complete view of it. You can trim the long hairs and just leave stubble if it gets too messy - that way, you can see the pattern in the stubble with less of the scraggly undeveloped look. \n\nIf you really want to, you can do strength training for the increased testosterone. It's also apparently been shown that literally just talking to women has an effect on T levels lol",

In a couple years if your think your growth is ok, try letting it grow for 6 weeks - iirc facial hair doesnt actually grow all at the same time, so when you grow it out for two weeks and then shave, that's a different set of hairs having their growth period - 6 weeks should be good to get a complete view of it. You can trim the long hairs and just leave stubble if it gets too messy - that way, you can see the pattern in the stubble with less of the scraggly undeveloped look. \n\nIf you really want to, you can do strength training for the increased testosterone. It's also apparently been shown that literally just talking to women has an effect on T levels lol",
