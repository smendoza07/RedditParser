    "body": "One of the most interesting arrangements (and oddly one of the sweetest) was with a man who was completely unaware it was happening.\n\nI found a profile on SA that was so weird that I had to send a message. It was a woman, I\u2019ll call her Sarah. So Sarah is the ex-wife of Tom (also a pseudonym to protect the truly innocent). They have several children and co-parent as well as they can from cities a three hour drive away. She still loves him and believes they will end up together in the end but need a few years to heal.\n\nVia video call she explained that she was concerned that Tom didn\u2019t have much of a social life, and she had experience sugaring prior to their marriage, so she basically wanted to pay someone PPM plus expenses to go on dates with him and get him to have fun while also stepping out of his once-a-week-karaoke-night comfort zone. I thought it sounded sweet.\n\nWe got along great and agreed to terms. The PPM was low, but mostly because it would likely be completely platonic (we did discuss how we would proceed if that changed but it was unlikely) due to the fact that Tom is very conservative and doesn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage.\n\nI know, it sounds made up. Stay with me, it gets weirder!\n\nShe didn\u2019t want him to find out about this at all, so we had to figure out a way for me to meet him. There were a couple mishaps. For one, I was going to go try to introduce myself under the guise of complimenting his karaoke performance, but she texted me and said that through one of the kids she found out that he fell asleep on the couch and wouldn\u2019t be going.\n\nFinally there was a breakthrough! They took their children on a family vacation for spring break (shoutout to healthy coparenting), and she was staying at his house with them that night before driving home, so she convinced him to go out for drinks at a nearby dive bar and texted me frantically to see if I could make it.\n\nI was free that night so while I was putting on a quick face, she hashed out a plan. They were sitting at a table so when I arrived she would meet me at the bar and we would \u201cmake friends\u201d and she would bring the cute stray back to the table.\n\nWe drank, we all sang karaoke, we all danced with each other, and it was clear to me that not only was she still in love with him, he was still madly in love with her, and it would only ever be platonic between him and I. So Tom and I exchanged numbers, and Sarah and I pretended to while he paid the bar tab, so pleased that our plan finally worked, and in a way that she and I didn\u2019t have to hide knowing each other, bonus!\n\nSarah said she could afford up to 5 monthly in our initial call. He and I went on 3-4 dates a month for four months. We had a lot of fun and I was able to pull him out of his shell to try new places. Sarah was happy that he was having such a good time, and that there was clearly nothing romantic between Tom and I.\n\nTwo major changes ended our lovely little triangle. He moved to the far south side of our city, whereas I am north of city limits, and we did hang out once or twice afterward, but it was a bit of a pain for both of us. Then Sarah fell ill and was hospitalized and I stepped back so they could focus on her health.\n\nShe is the picture of health now, and I\u2019m still friends with and talk to both of them via social media regularly.\n\nIt\u2019s still one of my favorite arrangements. \ud83d\ude0a",

I grew up on a block in the midwest that consisted of mainly first generation greek imigrants. My best buddy Mark lived four doors down and his folks divorced when he was young but his Dad remarried a much younger lady named Amy. Amy's younger sister Carla came to live with them after she some kind of health issue ( I later learned it was an extended stay in re-hab for drugs). \n\nAnyway I had known Amy since I was in 3rd grade and she was always very nice to me. She was busy raising her two young children but was kind to me when I was around even though I could tell she hated her step son Mark. So one day the summer before my Senior year I walked down to see what Mark was up to and Amy answered the door and told me he wasn't home, but could I do her a favor? She said \"Hey, Jay...anyway you could spend some time with Carla, just get her out of the house, she can't drive and we just need some space....I'll pay you\". \n\nAnd that started a very interesting relationship that next 3 years until Carla moved back west after my sophomore year of college.....",
