Children usually aren't shown things like human experimentation, murder of a character's parents as well as elderly people and children, flayed and dismembered limbs, or nearly anything shown in the show. \n\nI personally find such aggressive responses as opposed to more caring responses that are intended to aid someone to be abhorrent.
