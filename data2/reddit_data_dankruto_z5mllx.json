They had similar levels of backup in their fights so those cancel out.",

But Sakura in Kakashi or the other two\u2019s positions, and she\u2019s over a barreling coughing up teeth.\n\nThe usefulness you\u2019re talking about are narrative beats, not actual unique or exceptional accomplishments that others couldn\u2019t achieve equally or with some mildly difficult effort.",

And i love how youre just writing off sakura saving naruto so many times like that isnt one of the greatest accomplishments in the entire show lol.\n\nAnd no one else would be able to even touch sakura in terms of medical field no matter how much training they had. She has near perfect chakra control possibly the best in the entire series. She is top 5 in terms of intelligence on top of having years and years of hard work and dedication. So please stop downplaying and writing off her accomplishments jus so you can hate",

She shouldn't be affected by drugs so that's bullshit (I'm supporting her here) \n\n>So, if weakened, drugged, low chakra Sakura was able to not only dodge and keep up with these lightning attacks that are ALSO buffed by Kurama cloaks, what does that say about her speed\n\nSo if she's that fast when she's weakened, then she's even faster at base\n\nSo she's faster than the Raikage.\n\nBy that logic, she could beat: Pain, Konan, Jiraiya, Itachi (Itachi couldn't dodge Lightning so he's slower than her) , Killer B, Orochimaru, Sarutobi, Neji, Asuma, Kakuzu, Ohnoki, Mei, Gaara, Sage mode Naruto, and many more.\n\n\n\nWell, can't argue with that, I guess.

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak. I think she can dispatch a lot of the other characters. I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

Her best bet would be a Jutsu like the Rasenshuriken, which hits everything with trillions of microscopic chakra needles and therefore could shred all of the insects.",

Im saying that she can't keep track of thousands of chakra eating insects that can multiply, attract more insects, maybe even get into her mouth or get into her eyes, ears, or nose, and cause a lot of problems that way, as they could infiltrate her chakra stream and disrupt its flow while actively consuming it.

Yet even so, in base, she proceeds to fight all of these guys at once, about 7 of them if I remember correctly.\n\nWhy didn't her Byakogou negate this? She shouldn't be affected by drugs so that's bullshit (I'm supporting her here) \n\n>So, if weakened, drugged, low chakra Sakura was able to not only dodge and keep up with these lightning attacks that are ALSO buffed by Kurama cloaks, what does that say about her speed\n\nSo if she's that fast when she's weakened, then she's even faster at base\n\nSo she's faster than the Raikage.\n\nBy that logic, she could beat: Pain, Konan, Jiraiya, Itachi (Itachi couldn't dodge Lightning so he's slower than her) , Killer B, Orochimaru, Sarutobi, Neji, Asuma, Kakuzu, Ohnoki, Mei, Gaara, Sage mode Naruto, and many more.\n\n\n\nWell, can't argue with that, I guess.

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak. I think she can dispatch a lot of the other characters. I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

Even if Sakura tries to focus her chakra away from the bugs, theres too many for her chakra to avoid. Her best bet would be a Jutsu like the Rasenshuriken, which hits everything with trillions of microscopic chakra needles and therefore could shred all of the insects.",

She has near perfect chakra control possibly the best in the entire series. She is top 5 in terms of intelligence on top of having years and years of hard work and dedication.

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

Put Sasuke against Choji\u2019s fight during the war, and they\u2019re grass. But Sakura in Kakashi or the other two\u2019s positions, and she\u2019s over a barreling coughing up teeth.\n\nThe usefulness you\u2019re talking about are narrative beats, not actual unique or exceptional accomplishments that others couldn\u2019t achieve equally or with some mildly difficult effort.",

And i love how youre just writing off sakura saving naruto so many times like that isnt one of the greatest accomplishments in the entire show lol.\n\nAnd no one else would be able to even touch sakura in terms of medical field no matter how much training they had. She has near perfect chakra control possibly the best in the entire series. She is top 5 in terms of intelligence on top of having years and years of hard work and dedication. So please stop downplaying and writing off her accomplishments jus so you can hate",

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak.

I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

I don\u2019t think the regenerative abilities of the Byakugou can protect her from some good old fashioned meth. I dunno what to say about that. \n\nIt's bullshit. The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon. Lol. \nGood talk, man",

I don\u2019t think the regenerative abilities of the Byakugou can protect her from some good old fashioned meth. I dunno what to say about that. \n\nYeah pretty much. Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak. I think she can dispatch a lot of the other characters. I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

Yet even so, in base, she proceeds to fight all of these guys at once, about 7 of them if I remember correctly.\n\nWhy didn't her Byakogou negate this? She shouldn't be affected by drugs so that's bullshit (I'm supporting her here) \n\n>So, if weakened, drugged, low chakra Sakura was able to not only dodge and keep up with these lightning attacks that are ALSO buffed by Kurama cloaks, what does that say about her speed\n\nSo if she's that fast when she's weakened, then she's even faster at base\n\nSo she's faster than the Raikage.\n\nBy that logic, she could beat: Pain, Konan, Jiraiya, Itachi (Itachi couldn't dodge Lightning so he's slower than her) , Killer B, Orochimaru, Sarutobi, Neji, Asuma, Kakuzu, Ohnoki, Mei, Gaara, Sage mode Naruto, and many more.\n\n\n\nWell, can't argue with that, I guess.

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak. I think she can dispatch a lot of the other characters. I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto.

Even if Sakura tries to focus her chakra away from the bugs, theres too many for her chakra to avoid. Her best bet would be a Jutsu like the Rasenshuriken, which hits everything with trillions of microscopic chakra needles and therefore could shred all of the insects.",

Even if Sakura tries to focus her chakra away from the bugs, theres too many for her chakra to avoid. Her best bet would be a Jutsu like the Rasenshuriken, which hits everything with trillions of microscopic chakra needles and therefore could shred all of the insects.",

Yet even so, in base, she proceeds to fight all of these guys at once, about 7 of them if I remember correctly.\n\nWhy didn't her Byakogou negate this? She shouldn't be affected by drugs so that's bullshit (I'm supporting her here) \n\n>So, if weakened, drugged, low chakra Sakura was able to not only dodge and keep up with these lightning attacks that are ALSO buffed by Kurama cloaks, what does that say about her speed\n\nSo if she's that fast when she's weakened, then she's even faster at base\n\nSo she's faster than the Raikage.\n\nBy that logic, she could beat: Pain, Konan, Jiraiya, Itachi (Itachi couldn't dodge Lightning so he's slower than her) , Killer B, Orochimaru, Sarutobi, Neji, Asuma, Kakuzu, Ohnoki, Mei, Gaara, Sage mode Naruto, and many more.\n\n\n\nWell, can't argue with that, I guess.

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak. I think she can dispatch a lot of the other characters. I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

Even just one insect hiding somewhere on her could end up meaning victory for Shino if he plays his cards right. Even if Sakura tries to focus her chakra away from the bugs, theres too many for her chakra to avoid. Her best bet would be a Jutsu like the Rasenshuriken, which hits everything with trillions of microscopic chakra needles and therefore could shred all of the insects.",

Im saying that she can't keep track of thousands of chakra eating insects that can multiply, attract more insects, maybe even get into her mouth or get into her eyes, ears, or nose, and cause a lot of problems that way, as they could infiltrate her chakra stream and disrupt its flow while actively consuming it. They could also start eating her flesh and insides which would require her to constantly use up chakra healing herself. Thousands of parasitic insects swarming you and using intelligent maneuvers is a way more effective weapon than you think.",

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak. I think she can dispatch a lot of the other characters. I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

Im saying that she can't keep track of thousands of chakra eating insects that can multiply, attract more insects, maybe even get into her mouth or get into her eyes, ears, or nose, and cause a lot of problems that way, as they could infiltrate her chakra stream and disrupt its flow while actively consuming it. They could also start eating her flesh and insides which would require her to constantly use up chakra healing herself. Thousands of parasitic insects swarming you and using intelligent maneuvers is a way more effective weapon than you think.",

She shouldn't be affected by drugs so that's bullshit (I'm supporting her here) \n\n>So, if weakened, drugged, low chakra Sakura was able to not only dodge and keep up with these lightning attacks that are ALSO buffed by Kurama cloaks, what does that say about her speed\n\nSo if she's that fast when she's weakened, then she's even faster at base\n\nSo she's faster than the Raikage.\n\nBy that logic, she could beat: Pain, Konan, Jiraiya, Itachi (Itachi couldn't dodge Lightning so he's slower than her) , Killer B, Orochimaru, Sarutobi, Neji, Asuma, Kakuzu, Ohnoki, Mei, Gaara, Sage mode Naruto, and many more.\n\n\n\nWell, can't argue with that, I guess.

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak.

I don\u2019t particularly care for Hinata but I think she can put a beating down on some pretty formidable and favored characters like Shikamaru, Temari, and others. \n\nBut once we start moving towards some of the bruisers like Sakura and Lee, then she starts to fall flat.",

I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto.

Sakura hits her strongest after the original series has already ended. She gets even more powerful in Sasuke Retsuden and learns some pretty insane new skills. All of this falls under Adult/Boruto Sakura though so I wouldn\u2019t apply these feats to War Arc Sakura or anything.\n\nAs for Hinata, this doesnt mean she\u2019s weak.

The Writers like to conveniently forget abilities and insert abilities that have no reason to exist. It happens all the time and we both know this. The writing and scaling is all over the place.\n\nYou have proven Sakura to be stronger than people she has no business being stronger than with 'feats'.\n\nIt's factual and bullshit. \n\nSame reason Naruto had no business beating Pain but they conveniently forgot the Rinnegan can see chakra when Naruto transformed into rocks.\n\nSame reason Sasuke loses to people he has no business losing to.\n\nThat's why I don't like to argue with feats. I once saw a guy use feats to prove Suigetsu beats sage mode Naruto. And it was factual. \n\nThey never explain why Sakura is that fast and it makes no sense in-universe, but she is and we can't delete it from Canon. \n\nThat's also why I stopped watching the show and go with my head canon.

She shouldn't be affected by drugs so that's bullshit (I'm supporting her here) \n\n>So, if weakened, drugged, low chakra Sakura was able to not only dodge and keep up with these lightning attacks that are ALSO buffed by Kurama cloaks, what does that say about her speed\n\nSo if she's that fast when she's weakened, then she's even faster at base\n\nSo she's faster than the Raikage.\n\nBy that logic, she could beat: Pain, Konan, Jiraiya, Itachi (Itachi couldn't dodge Lightning so he's slower than her) , Killer B, Orochimaru, Sarutobi, Neji, Asuma, Kakuzu, Ohnoki, Mei, Gaara, Sage mode Naruto, and many more.\n\n\n\nWell, can't argue with that, I guess.
