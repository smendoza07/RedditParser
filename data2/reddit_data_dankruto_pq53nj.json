Like I personally liked the idea of kaguya, but the clan as a whole is lame as hell and sorta takes the ninja aspect of Naruto away. Like don't get me wrong, the ninja aspect was always going down, because even in the zabuza arc, Naruto said he wasn't going to follow the path of the shinobi, which at the time meant ninjas, but by the end of the show, literally nobody could be considered a ninja except for Kakashi, and even then he had his susano. Like I respect it and im pretty sure it was always the plan, but man . . . Can we get actual ninjas back?\n\nMy main problem with boruto is the otsosuki and the characters themselves not being or fighting actual ninjas. Like your gonna tell me that just because 5 villages maid peace, that there's literally no more enemy ninjas? That's bullshit. And every time someone tries to defend boruto and the otsosuki they say \"well its a time of peace\" correction, its a barely managed peace treaty between the 5 main villages. They aren't the same. There's still tension between the lightning and the other villages, and the stone dont trust the leaf. This is evident in the stone village arc in boruto, and in the last when the raikage had a Chakra canon without telling the other kage causing tension between them. Especially the leaf since they had shinobi on the moon dealing with the problem. More specifically, they had hinata fucking hyuuga, shikamaru nara, and NARUTO UZUMAKI ON THE MOON! if they had died, the hyuga and nara go to war with the lightning, and the entire world does to since they killed the man who saved the entire fucking planet, and is seen as the next hokage by literally everyone on the fucking earth. There is definitely still hostile shinobi out there. Shouldve went into that, as well as the political side a little more instead of the trash ass filler we ended up with",

What mystic counter jutsu is Kakashi going to use? How is either party going to deceive the other to win?\" \n\nNow, when fights happen I already know what's going to happen.

There are plenty more problems in Boruto though . The villains are mostly really bland . The only villain that I have found interesting till now is Isshiki . Rest all are mostly boring . Another thing is Boruro as a protagonist is a bit weak . I dont know why but I dont like him . I like Kawaki though . The one thing for which I will give Boruto credit though is the good writing of new gen female characters especially Sarada . Sarada was a better character in the first 20 episodes than Sakura was in the 135 episodes of OG Naruto . So I would give them credit for this .",

They could go the MHA and JJK way with having the OP characters not look after small matters, and give time for the next gen to develop. Then introduce the isshiki level threat later on, and use Isshiki to disable naruto and Sasuke. This should be done when the characters are like 16 or something, so they have time to develop and take up responsibility.\n\nI wouldn't call what boruto did \"compensating\" I call it \"lazy writing\"",

Like I personally liked the idea of kaguya, but the clan as a whole is lame as hell and sorta takes the ninja aspect of Naruto away. Like don't get me wrong, the ninja aspect was always going down, because even in the zabuza arc, Naruto said he wasn't going to follow the path of the shinobi, which at the time meant ninjas, but by the end of the show, literally nobody could be considered a ninja except for Kakashi, and even then he had his susano. Like I respect it and im pretty sure it was always the plan, but man . . . Can we get actual ninjas back?\n\nMy main problem with boruto is the otsosuki and the characters themselves not being or fighting actual ninjas. Like your gonna tell me that just because 5 villages maid peace, that there's literally no more enemy ninjas? That's bullshit. And every time someone tries to defend boruto and the otsosuki they say \"well its a time of peace\" correction, its a barely managed peace treaty between the 5 main villages. They aren't the same. There's still tension between the lightning and the other villages, and the stone dont trust the leaf. This is evident in the stone village arc in boruto, and in the last when the raikage had a Chakra canon without telling the other kage causing tension between them. Especially the leaf since they had shinobi on the moon dealing with the problem. More specifically, they had hinata fucking hyuuga, shikamaru nara, and NARUTO UZUMAKI ON THE MOON! if they had died, the hyuga and nara go to war with the lightning, and the entire world does to since they killed the man who saved the entire fucking planet, and is seen as the next hokage by literally everyone on the fucking earth. There is definitely still hostile shinobi out there. Shouldve went into that, as well as the political side a little more instead of the trash ass filler we ended up with",

Another thing is Boruro as a protagonist is a bit weak . I dont know why but I dont like him . I like Kawaki though . The one thing for which I will give Boruto credit though is the good writing of new gen female characters especially Sarada . Sarada was a better character in the first 20 episodes than Sakura was in the 135 episodes of OG Naruto . So I would give them credit for this .",

They could go the MHA and JJK way with having the OP characters not look after small matters, and give time for the next gen to develop. Then introduce the isshiki level threat later on, and use Isshiki to disable naruto and Sasuke. This should be done when the characters are like 16 or something, so they have time to develop and take up responsibility.\n\nI wouldn't call what boruto did \"compensating\" I call it \"lazy writing\"",

Momo absorbed jutsu but I\u2019m not even sure if it was the rinnegan\u2019s ability or his own special one.\n\nLike I get that Pain had the Rinnegan for like 15 years, but the immortal alien gods had them a *bit* longer.

They got scrapped. I wanna know what those stories were meant to be about.

And since Naruto is a master at adding in chakra nature to jutsu, it shouldn't be a surprise that he spams Rasengan variations.\n\nAlso Naruto even at its most explosion-heavy was never DBZ. Every fight required strategy. I don't know any fights that were decided with beam tug-of-wars and the only time I saw an actual fight decided by sheer power was Madara vs the 5 Kage.",

They needed money. If u watched the Team 7 vs boro fight u can see tactics and other fights too. Ah yes Boruto the brat even though he stopped and in the manga he accepted his fate as a vessel and ready to die. In that case lets call Naruto an absent father. For fuck christ why do people watch a show if they hate it",

He\u2019s literally made thousands of mistakes. \n\nAnd then once he learned Sage mode it kinda just broke the power gap between him and Kage level enemies. Then he barely fought a weakened Sasuke, then used Sage mode to steal Kurama Chakra with his mom. So he just got huge power boosts after that. Then he literally fought an entire war and\u2026 well it makes sense why things ramp up so quickly. \n\nBut sharingan hacks are still kinda bullshit. I get alien god stuff but still\u2026 even the Otosuki don\u2019t possess some of that broken shit. Izanami and Izanagi. Susanno. Like Mangekyo honestly makes the Rinnegan look meh in half the people we\u2019ve seen besides Momoshiki. I haven\u2019t really gotten farther than that with the aliens though.",

Madara only uses the heaven meteor. Sasuke only ever uses the meteor and planetary devastation. \n\nEven the alien gods where these powers came from don\u2019t even really do anything. Momo absorbed jutsu but I\u2019m not even sure if it was the rinnegan\u2019s ability or his own special one.\n\nLike I get that Pain had the Rinnegan for like 15 years, but the immortal alien gods had them a *bit* longer.
