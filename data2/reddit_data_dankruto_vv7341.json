His great grandson returning the stress is fate and we know fate exist in Naruto. \n* Hiruzen wasn't able to sacrifice himself instead of Minato, causing a lot of issues, Naruto wouldn't want to make the same mistake with Sasuke's descendant who is Hokage (who's neice or child can be Sarada)\n* A surprise change of jailer, but, the difference is that Kurama chose to bond with Boruto to save Boruto. Kurama is sacrificing his freedom to save a child of his best friend and the one who saved him. \n* The movies being pure fan service badass fighta because that's the best thing about part 2 Naruto. The plot kinda went off the rails but a lot of the fights were top tier awesome sauce. \n* Frame the movies as Naruto telling them as stories to his kids, grand kids, or great grand kids. So... If anything doesn't ever line up we can just chalk it up to Naruto getting the story wrong or embellishing the facts lol. \n* The movies can show us how Sakura/Sasuke and Naruto/Hinata sat down and got to know each other and actually fall in love (both couples are a fucking mess and a half in canon).",

Getting stronger, learning, doing fucked up shit. Show Orochimaru being fucked up too the of course... Then the conclusion is Sasuke killing Orochimaru. Sasuke then goes to Team 7 and just assumes they will come help him take care of Itachi, which they do. Shit goes south bc Itachi fight and Sasuke splits from Naruto and Sakura (who were able to easily hold off Kisame bc teamwork makes the dream work).\n\n===\n\nKabuto... Someone finds him in the genjutsu and just like, idk, stabs him in the brain. He goes out like he lived, like a bitch. \n\n===\n\nNow, I think Orochimaru has the potential to be the big bad, especially if you take away the bullshit fate, alien big Bunny Mommy, and all that...

He was one of my all time favorite love to hate, sadistic anime villains ever.  His  sick experimentations gave me chills as a kid.

I would even scrap the Uzumaki being special... Yeah Naruto's father is the 4th, but Minato married someone who wasn't from a super special clan and Minato himself was just a hard worker... I mean, Minato was called a genius but a lot of his stuff came from Tobirama (Flying Thunder and Shadow Clones).\n\n===\n\nNaruto could have easily been a nobody if he didn't work hard. Which is what part one was all about. Being related to the 4th gave him no special advantages beyond being able to hijack Tobirama's techniques lol.\n\n===\n\nAliens can be a movie topic. Naruto is telling his kids or grandkids about the time Team Seven saved the world from aliens. \n\n===\n\nBig Bunny Mommy can be part of that alien story, perhaps she is sealed into the planet and if the aliens release her, the planet is destroyed. \n\n===\n\nWith Part 2 of the actual manga I would keep Pain as the primary antagonist. Have him and Naruto talk it out a bit early but make it clear that they both are right. Pain is a realist and Naruto is an idealist. Have them fight three times. Once away from the Leaf, Naruto pushes a few paths away, once where the leaf is destroyed (heavy casualties but some survive), and the final time where Naruto finally wins. \n\n===\n\nTobi isn't the mastermind, Tobi is just Tobi. The multiple twist villains was a really bad choice so leave it with Pain as Pain is everything you need in a villain.",

Perfectly!  \n\nI'm a big fan of Pain/ Nagato being the final villains.  Along with a deeper exploration of his and Naruto's opposing solutions to peace. Nagato made decent points about how only when faced with the true threat of pain and suffering will the nations end their endless wars and unite in shared fear.  We even see this as being the case during the 4th Shinobi War against the 2 Uchihas. \n\n It would've been great if Shippuden could've fully explored this conflict instead of hopping on the unambiguously evil \"trap all life in a dream forever\" plot Madara and Obito had going.  It went from an extremist with an actual solution for peace to two whinny boys lashing out at the world.  Killing 10s of thousands in a pointless war just to kill everyone else more slowly while trapped in a dream.\n\nAnother big problem I had by the end of Shippuden was the egregious amounts of characters crammed into parallels of Naruto and Sasuke. Pain/ Nagato was the last Naruto parallel we really needed.  Not another 1:1 clone of Naruto, but a vaguely similar character who was corrupted pretty early in life.   It fit more thematically with the Orochimaru and Jiraya also being more direct parallels to Naruto and Sasuke, plus Sakura and Tsunade.  Both showing different ways of how Naruto's life could've been much more different for the worse. \n\nBut then Kishi just had to keep churning one parallel after the next with Obito/ Kakashi/ Rin, Madara/ Hashirama, and Indra/ Ashura.",

First, it was shown that Orochimaru was never friends with Jiraiya, just Conrad's, Sasuke was shown to have cared for Team 7, called the precious before being willing to sacrifice his life so they can get away (versus Gaara). Secondly, Sasuke isn't really what I would call a scientist, he's more of a wrecking ball. Sasuke also doesn't do things because he's bored, he has a goal, one that he will see through. Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

His great grandson returning the stress is fate and we know fate exist in Naruto. \n* Hiruzen wasn't able to sacrifice himself instead of Minato, causing a lot of issues, Naruto wouldn't want to make the same mistake with Sasuke's descendant who is Hokage (who's neice or child can be Sarada)\n* A surprise change of jailer, but, the difference is that Kurama chose to bond with Boruto to save Boruto. Kurama is sacrificing his freedom to save a child of his best friend and the one who saved him. \n* The movies being pure fan service badass fighta because that's the best thing about part 2 Naruto. The plot kinda went off the rails but a lot of the fights were top tier awesome sauce. \n* Frame the movies as Naruto telling them as stories to his kids, grand kids, or great grand kids. So... If anything doesn't ever line up we can just chalk it up to Naruto getting the story wrong or embellishing the facts lol. \n* The movies can show us how Sakura/Sasuke and Naruto/Hinata sat down and got to know each other and actually fall in love (both couples are a fucking mess and a half in canon).",

Yeah Naruto's father is the 4th, but Minato married someone who wasn't from a super special clan and Minato himself was just a hard worker... I mean, Minato was called a genius but a lot of his stuff came from Tobirama (Flying Thunder and Shadow Clones).\n\n===\n\nNaruto could have easily been a nobody if he didn't work hard. Which is what part one was all about. Being related to the 4th gave him no special advantages beyond being able to hijack Tobirama's techniques lol.\n\n===\n\nAliens can be a movie topic. Naruto is telling his kids or grandkids about the time Team Seven saved the world from aliens. \n\n===\n\nBig Bunny Mommy can be part of that alien story, perhaps she is sealed into the planet and if the aliens release her, the planet is destroyed. \n\n===\n\nWith Part 2 of the actual manga I would keep Pain as the primary antagonist. Have him and Naruto talk it out a bit early but make it clear that they both are right. Pain is a realist and Naruto is an idealist. Have them fight three times. Once away from the Leaf, Naruto pushes a few paths away, once where the leaf is destroyed (heavy casualties but some survive), and the final time where Naruto finally wins. \n\n===\n\nTobi isn't the mastermind, Tobi is just Tobi.

Perfectly!  \n\nI'm a big fan of Pain/ Nagato being the final villains.  Along with a deeper exploration of his and Naruto's opposing solutions to peace. Nagato made decent points about how only when faced with the true threat of pain and suffering will the nations end their endless wars and unite in shared fear.  We even see this as being the case during the 4th Shinobi War against the 2 Uchihas. \n\n It would've been great if Shippuden could've fully explored this conflict instead of hopping on the unambiguously evil \"trap all life in a dream forever\" plot Madara and Obito had going.  It went from an extremist with an actual solution for peace to two whinny boys lashing out at the world.  Killing 10s of thousands in a pointless war just to kill everyone else more slowly while trapped in a dream.\n\nAnother big problem I had by the end of Shippuden was the egregious amounts of characters crammed into parallels of Naruto and Sasuke. Pain/ Nagato was the last Naruto parallel we really needed.  Not another 1:1 clone of Naruto, but a vaguely similar character who was corrupted pretty early in life.   It fit more thematically with the Orochimaru and Jiraya also being more direct parallels to Naruto and Sasuke, plus Sakura and Tsunade.  Both showing different ways of how Naruto's life could've been much more different for the worse. \n\nBut then Kishi just had to keep churning one parallel after the next with Obito/ Kakashi/ Rin, Madara/ Hashirama, and Indra/ Ashura.",

First, it was shown that Orochimaru was never friends with Jiraiya, just Conrad's, Sasuke was shown to have cared for Team 7, called the precious before being willing to sacrifice his life so they can get away (versus Gaara). Secondly, Sasuke isn't really what I would call a scientist, he's more of a wrecking ball. Sasuke also doesn't do things because he's bored, he has a goal, one that he will see through. Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

His great grandson returning the stress is fate and we know fate exist in Naruto. \n* Hiruzen wasn't able to sacrifice himself instead of Minato, causing a lot of issues, Naruto wouldn't want to make the same mistake with Sasuke's descendant who is Hokage (who's neice or child can be Sarada)\n* A surprise change of jailer, but, the difference is that Kurama chose to bond with Boruto to save Boruto. Kurama is sacrificing his freedom to save a child of his best friend and the one who saved him. \n* The movies being pure fan service badass fighta because that's the best thing about part 2 Naruto. The plot kinda went off the rails but a lot of the fights were top tier awesome sauce. \n* Frame the movies as Naruto telling them as stories to his kids, grand kids, or great grand kids. So... If anything doesn't ever line up we can just chalk it up to Naruto getting the story wrong or embellishing the facts lol. \n* The movies can show us how Sakura/Sasuke and Naruto/Hinata sat down and got to know each other and actually fall in love (both couples are a fucking mess and a half in canon).",

Which is what part one was all about. Being related to the 4th gave him no special advantages beyond being able to hijack Tobirama's techniques lol.\n\n===\n\nAliens can be a movie topic.

Perfectly!  \n\nI'm a big fan of Pain/ Nagato being the final villains.  Along with a deeper exploration of his and Naruto's opposing solutions to peace. Nagato made decent points about how only when faced with the true threat of pain and suffering will the nations end their endless wars and unite in shared fear.  We even see this as being the case during the 4th Shinobi War against the 2 Uchihas. \n\n It would've been great if Shippuden could've fully explored this conflict instead of hopping on the unambiguously evil \"trap all life in a dream forever\" plot Madara and Obito had going.  It went from an extremist with an actual solution for peace to two whinny boys lashing out at the world.  Killing 10s of thousands in a pointless war just to kill everyone else more slowly while trapped in a dream.\n\nAnother big problem I had by the end of Shippuden was the egregious amounts of characters crammed into parallels of Naruto and Sasuke. Pain/ Nagato was the last Naruto parallel we really needed.  Not another 1:1 clone of Naruto, but a vaguely similar character who was corrupted pretty early in life.   It fit more thematically with the Orochimaru and Jiraya also being more direct parallels to Naruto and Sasuke, plus Sakura and Tsunade.  Both showing different ways of how Naruto's life could've been much more different for the worse. \n\nBut then Kishi just had to keep churning one parallel after the next with Obito/ Kakashi/ Rin, Madara/ Hashirama, and Indra/ Ashura.",

First, it was shown that Orochimaru was never friends with Jiraiya, just Conrad's, Sasuke was shown to have cared for Team 7, called the precious before being willing to sacrifice his life so they can get away (versus Gaara). Secondly, Sasuke isn't really what I would call a scientist, he's more of a wrecking ball. Sasuke also doesn't do things because he's bored, he has a goal, one that he will see through. Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

His great grandson returning the stress is fate and we know fate exist in Naruto. \n* Hiruzen wasn't able to sacrifice himself instead of Minato, causing a lot of issues, Naruto wouldn't want to make the same mistake with Sasuke's descendant who is Hokage (who's neice or child can be Sarada)\n* A surprise change of jailer, but, the difference is that Kurama chose to bond with Boruto to save Boruto. Kurama is sacrificing his freedom to save a child of his best friend and the one who saved him. \n* The movies being pure fan service badass fighta because that's the best thing about part 2 Naruto. The plot kinda went off the rails but a lot of the fights were top tier awesome sauce. \n* Frame the movies as Naruto telling them as stories to his kids, grand kids, or great grand kids. So... If anything doesn't ever line up we can just chalk it up to Naruto getting the story wrong or embellishing the facts lol. \n* The movies can show us how Sakura/Sasuke and Naruto/Hinata sat down and got to know each other and actually fall in love (both couples are a fucking mess and a half in canon).",

Yeah Naruto's father is the 4th, but Minato married someone who wasn't from a super special clan and Minato himself was just a hard worker... I mean, Minato was called a genius but a lot of his stuff came from Tobirama (Flying Thunder and Shadow Clones).\n\n===\n\nNaruto could have easily been a nobody if he didn't work hard. Which is what part one was all about. Being related to the 4th gave him no special advantages beyond being able to hijack Tobirama's techniques lol.\n\n===\n\nAliens can be a movie topic. Naruto is telling his kids or grandkids about the time Team Seven saved the world from aliens. \n\n===\n\nBig Bunny Mommy can be part of that alien story, perhaps she is sealed into the planet and if the aliens release her, the planet is destroyed. \n\n===\n\nWith Part 2 of the actual manga I would keep Pain as the primary antagonist. Have him and Naruto talk it out a bit early but make it clear that they both are right. Pain is a realist and Naruto is an idealist. Have them fight three times. Once away from the Leaf, Naruto pushes a few paths away, once where the leaf is destroyed (heavy casualties but some survive), and the final time where Naruto finally wins. \n\n===\n\nTobi isn't the mastermind, Tobi is just Tobi.

Perfectly!  \n\nI'm a big fan of Pain/ Nagato being the final villains.  Along with a deeper exploration of his and Naruto's opposing solutions to peace. Nagato made decent points about how only when faced with the true threat of pain and suffering will the nations end their endless wars and unite in shared fear.  We even see this as being the case during the 4th Shinobi War against the 2 Uchihas. \n\n It would've been great if Shippuden could've fully explored this conflict instead of hopping on the unambiguously evil \"trap all life in a dream forever\" plot Madara and Obito had going.  It went from an extremist with an actual solution for peace to two whinny boys lashing out at the world.  Killing 10s of thousands in a pointless war just to kill everyone else more slowly while trapped in a dream.\n\nAnother big problem I had by the end of Shippuden was the egregious amounts of characters crammed into parallels of Naruto and Sasuke. Pain/ Nagato was the last Naruto parallel we really needed.  Not another 1:1 clone of Naruto, but a vaguely similar character who was corrupted pretty early in life.   It fit more thematically with the Orochimaru and Jiraya also being more direct parallels to Naruto and Sasuke, plus Sakura and Tsunade.  Both showing different ways of how Naruto's life could've been much more different for the worse. \n\nBut then Kishi just had to keep churning one parallel after the next with Obito/ Kakashi/ Rin, Madara/ Hashirama, and Indra/ Ashura.",

First, it was shown that Orochimaru was never friends with Jiraiya, just Conrad's, Sasuke was shown to have cared for Team 7, called the precious before being willing to sacrifice his life so they can get away (versus Gaara). Secondly, Sasuke isn't really what I would call a scientist, he's more of a wrecking ball. Sasuke also doesn't do things because he's bored, he has a goal, one that he will see through. Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

Sasuke then goes to Team 7 and just assumes they will come help him take care of Itachi, which they do.

Yeah Naruto's father is the 4th, but Minato married someone who wasn't from a super special clan and Minato himself was just a hard worker... I mean, Minato was called a genius but a lot of his stuff came from Tobirama (Flying Thunder and Shadow Clones).\n\n===\n\nNaruto could have easily been a nobody if he didn't work hard. Which is what part one was all about. Being related to the 4th gave him no special advantages beyond being able to hijack Tobirama's techniques lol.\n\n===\n\nAliens can be a movie topic. Naruto is telling his kids or grandkids about the time Team Seven saved the world from aliens. \n\n===\n\nBig Bunny Mommy can be part of that alien story, perhaps she is sealed into the planet and if the aliens release her, the planet is destroyed. \n\n===\n\nWith Part 2 of the actual manga I would keep Pain as the primary antagonist. Have him and Naruto talk it out a bit early but make it clear that they both are right. Pain is a realist and Naruto is an idealist. Have them fight three times. Once away from the Leaf, Naruto pushes a few paths away, once where the leaf is destroyed (heavy casualties but some survive), and the final time where Naruto finally wins. \n\n===\n\nTobi isn't the mastermind, Tobi is just Tobi.

Perfectly!  \n\nI'm a big fan of Pain/ Nagato being the final villains.  Along with a deeper exploration of his and Naruto's opposing solutions to peace. Nagato made decent points about how only when faced with the true threat of pain and suffering will the nations end their endless wars and unite in shared fear.  We even see this as being the case during the 4th Shinobi War against the 2 Uchihas. \n\n It would've been great if Shippuden could've fully explored this conflict instead of hopping on the unambiguously evil \"trap all life in a dream forever\" plot Madara and Obito had going.  It went from an extremist with an actual solution for peace to two whinny boys lashing out at the world.  Killing 10s of thousands in a pointless war just to kill everyone else more slowly while trapped in a dream.\n\nAnother big problem I had by the end of Shippuden was the egregious amounts of characters crammed into parallels of Naruto and Sasuke. Pain/ Nagato was the last Naruto parallel we really needed.  Not another 1:1 clone of Naruto, but a vaguely similar character who was corrupted pretty early in life.   It fit more thematically with the Orochimaru and Jiraya also being more direct parallels to Naruto and Sasuke, plus Sakura and Tsunade.  Both showing different ways of how Naruto's life could've been much more different for the worse. \n\nBut then Kishi just had to keep churning one parallel after the next with Obito/ Kakashi/ Rin, Madara/ Hashirama, and Indra/ Ashura.",

First, it was shown that Orochimaru was never friends with Jiraiya, just Conrad's, Sasuke was shown to have cared for Team 7, called the precious before being willing to sacrifice his life so they can get away (versus Gaara). Secondly, Sasuke isn't really what I would call a scientist, he's more of a wrecking ball. Sasuke also doesn't do things because he's bored, he has a goal, one that he will see through. Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

I mean, Minato was called a genius but a lot of his stuff came from Tobirama (Flying Thunder and Shadow Clones).\n\n===\n\nNaruto could have easily been a nobody if he didn't work hard.

Have him and Naruto talk it out a bit early but make it clear that they both are right. Pain is a realist and Naruto is an idealist. Have them fight three times.

Along with a deeper exploration of his and Naruto's opposing solutions to peace. Nagato made decent points about how only when faced with the true threat of pain and suffering will the nations end their endless wars and unite in shared fear.  We even see this as being the case during the 4th Shinobi War against the 2 Uchihas. \n\n It would've been great if Shippuden could've fully explored this conflict instead of hopping on the unambiguously evil \"trap all life in a dream forever\" plot Madara and Obito had going.  It went from an extremist with an actual solution for peace to two whinny boys lashing out at the world.  Killing 10s of thousands in a pointless war just to kill everyone else more slowly while trapped in a dream.\n\nAnother big problem I had by the end of Shippuden was the egregious amounts of characters crammed into parallels of Naruto and Sasuke. Pain/ Nagato was the last Naruto parallel we really needed.  Not another 1:1 clone of Naruto, but a vaguely similar character who was corrupted pretty early in life.   It fit more thematically with the Orochimaru and Jiraya also being more direct parallels to Naruto and Sasuke, plus Sakura and Tsunade.  Both showing different ways of how Naruto's life could've been much more different for the worse. \n\nBut then Kishi just had to keep churning one parallel after the next with Obito/ Kakashi/ Rin, Madara/ Hashirama, and Indra/ Ashura.",

First, it was shown that Orochimaru was never friends with Jiraiya, just Conrad's, Sasuke was shown to have cared for Team 7, called the precious before being willing to sacrifice his life so they can get away (versus Gaara). Secondly, Sasuke isn't really what I would call a scientist, he's more of a wrecking ball. Sasuke also doesn't do things because he's bored, he has a goal, one that he will see through. Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

Sasuke didn't leave on his own accord, Orochimaru did. Orochimaru was said to have be one obsessed with immortality but the Orochimaru we meet in part one was just bored af. He could have had Sasuke any number of ways, could have killed Hiruzen twice as many ways... But he was bored of how stagnant the world had gotten. Sasuke is nothing like Orochimaru. They both want power? Everyone in the Shinobi nations want power. Naruto wants power, Sakura wants power, power is the name of the game. \n\n\n===\n\nSasuke never really killed anyone who didn't deserve it, never really manipulated anyone who didn't deserve it, and really his biggest crime is not being aligned with a Shinobi village that, as we know, is a pretty shitty place. Yeah he fought Naruto, but like, Naruto is part of a much bigger problem (he's a lap dog of a fucked up system and doesn't have the mental maturity to let others have their own agency).",

Yeah Naruto's father is the 4th, but Minato married someone who wasn't from a super special clan and Minato himself was just a hard worker... I mean, Minato was called a genius but a lot of his stuff came from Tobirama (Flying Thunder and Shadow Clones).\n\n===\n\nNaruto could have easily been a nobody if he didn't work hard. Which is what part one was all about. Being related to the 4th gave him no special advantages beyond being able to hijack Tobirama's techniques lol.\n\n===\n\nAliens can be a movie topic. Naruto is telling his kids or grandkids about the time Team Seven saved the world from aliens. \n\n===\n\nBig Bunny Mommy can be part of that alien story, perhaps she is sealed into the planet and if the aliens release her, the planet is destroyed. \n\n===\n\nWith Part 2 of the actual manga I would keep Pain as the primary antagonist. Have him and Naruto talk it out a bit early but make it clear that they both are right. Pain is a realist and Naruto is an idealist. Have them fight three times. Once away from the Leaf, Naruto pushes a few paths away, once where the leaf is destroyed (heavy casualties but some survive), and the final time where Naruto finally wins. \n\n===\n\nTobi isn't the mastermind, Tobi is just Tobi. The multiple twist villains was a really bad choice so leave it with Pain as Pain is everything you need in a villain.",
