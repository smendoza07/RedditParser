    "body": "I have several kinks that require the use of a safe word. I was on my fourth date with a vegan girl, and she knows we are going to try some kinks. At dinner, I told her the safe word was \"bananas,\" and then told her: \"don't worry, if you can't remember that, just say any fruit and I will stop.\"  That got me a small laugh from her (bigger laugh from me though), but lame jokes are the closest thing I have to a personality, so your boy has to take his wins when he can.\n#\nWell that was a really dumb move on my part. We start having sex, and I start to get in my own head. 'What if she says tomato???'  I mean, it's not green, so let's call that a fruit.  A minute later, my mind does it again: 'Well what about jicama???' It's like an apple, but it looks like a potato... so, vegetable?  Then it hits me. Every day, this girl eats things that sound like characters in a Harry potter book. I screwed up. I should have told her she could only use fruit from the non-fiction section of the produce isle. I am sure my face looked like a combination of terror that I might not recognize a safe word, and whatever face I make when I am grocery shopping. I'm sure it wasn't sexy, but none of my facial expressions are, so I doubt she noticed.\n#\nWhelp folks, it was rocking hot. Really good time, the whole time. Now I can't go into the produce section of a grocery store without getting a raging erection. 100% her fault. I just wanted to do some vanilla rape role play, and she made it all healthy and weird. She made me a freak. Smh. I can't even wear my skinny jeans anymore. There are fruit stands on every block in my neighborhood. I can't tell my insurance agent that I wrecked my car because my pants exploded like a defective airbag. Might seem like a \"small\" loss to you guys, but the gay men of West Hollywood don't like me wearing anything where you have use a lot of imagination.\n#\nPlease tell me if you know of any adult book stores that sell good strawberries. I am running low on cocktail fixings, and I am so tired of getting kicked out of whole foods.",
