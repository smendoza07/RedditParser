A more canon example would be the Shikamaru light novel implying that he still has it since he has the chakra of all nine tailed beasts (a requirement for obtaining it) and him flying when he fought Toneri in The Last. Naruto just never bothered using it similar to how Sasuke never used the Six Paths of Pain apart from the Deva and Preta Paths but him having complete mastery of the Rinnegan implies he could and just doesn't need to use all of them (his Susanoo's a much better option compared to the Asura and Animal Paths for example)\n\nAs for the truthseeking orbs, the common theory is that Naruto lost them when he fought Madara, then Kaguya, and eventually Sasuke.\n\nBoth Hokage Naruto and Supporting Kage Sasuke are way too powerful for non Otsutsuki opponents hence the shortage of feats suggesting they still have their Six Paths abilities outside the Momoshiki fight although Sasuke still having his Rinnegan and Naruto still having the chakra of all the tailed beasts is proof enough that they still have Six Paths chakra",

Kakashi, Minato, and Guy did a decent job of staying relevant right up until the ancient-alien/demon-woman Kaguya showed up in the finale. \n\nKakashi wasn't \"kick Naruto or Sauske's ass\" strong, but he was at least relevant to the fights. He also demolished all the reanimated war heroes he came up against, just playing whack-a-mole with dead legends.\n\nMinato was teleporting people, bombs, and mystical nonsense around the battlefield against Obito and Madara. Kaguya, actually even just Madara, made him useless; but he was hanging with late-game Obito Uchiha for a good while.\n\nMight Guy was the *only* non-alien character that nearly killed 10-tails Madara. Dude had to sacrifice his life for it, but that's still really impressive for someone from a more or less throwaway clan.  \n\nSakura was....present I guess. She didn't accomplish anything, but she was surprisingly durable I guess? I dunno, man, she really should have been immediately annihilated by Madara or Kaguya. Adult Sakura is a great example of someone who would have been ludicrously strong pre-Shippuden or at the start of Shippuden. She just fell victim to the power creep more than any of the other main characters.",

A more canon example would be the Shikamaru light novel implying that he still has it since he has the chakra of all nine tailed beasts (a requirement for obtaining it) and him flying when he fought Toneri in The Last. Naruto just never bothered using it similar to how Sasuke never used the Six Paths of Pain apart from the Deva and Preta Paths but him having complete mastery of the Rinnegan implies he could and just doesn't need to use all of them (his Susanoo's a much better option compared to the Asura and Animal Paths for example)\n\nAs for the truthseeking orbs, the common theory is that Naruto lost them when he fought Madara, then Kaguya, and eventually Sasuke.\n\nBoth Hokage Naruto and Supporting Kage Sasuke are way too powerful for non Otsutsuki opponents hence the shortage of feats suggesting they still have their Six Paths abilities outside the Momoshiki fight although Sasuke still having his Rinnegan and Naruto still having the chakra of all the tailed beasts is proof enough that they still have Six Paths chakra",

Kakashi, Minato, and Guy did a decent job of staying relevant right up until the ancient-alien/demon-woman Kaguya showed up in the finale. \n\nKakashi wasn't \"kick Naruto or Sauske's ass\" strong, but he was at least relevant to the fights. He also demolished all the reanimated war heroes he came up against, just playing whack-a-mole with dead legends.\n\nMinato was teleporting people, bombs, and mystical nonsense around the battlefield against Obito and Madara. Kaguya, actually even just Madara, made him useless; but he was hanging with late-game Obito Uchiha for a good while.\n\nMight Guy was the *only* non-alien character that nearly killed 10-tails Madara. Dude had to sacrifice his life for it, but that's still really impressive for someone from a more or less throwaway clan.  \n\nSakura was....present I guess. She didn't accomplish anything, but she was surprisingly durable I guess? I dunno, man, she really should have been immediately annihilated by Madara or Kaguya. Adult Sakura is a great example of someone who would have been ludicrously strong pre-Shippuden or at the start of Shippuden. She just fell victim to the power creep more than any of the other main characters.",

A more canon example would be the Shikamaru light novel implying that he still has it since he has the chakra of all nine tailed beasts (a requirement for obtaining it) and him flying when he fought Toneri in The Last. Naruto just never bothered using it similar to how Sasuke never used the Six Paths of Pain apart from the Deva and Preta Paths but him having complete mastery of the Rinnegan implies he could and just doesn't need to use all of them (his Susanoo's a much better option compared to the Asura and Animal Paths for example)\n\nAs for the truthseeking orbs, the common theory is that Naruto lost them when he fought Madara, then Kaguya, and eventually Sasuke.\n\nBoth Hokage Naruto and Supporting Kage Sasuke are way too powerful for non Otsutsuki opponents hence the shortage of feats suggesting they still have their Six Paths abilities outside the Momoshiki fight although Sasuke still having his Rinnegan and Naruto still having the chakra of all the tailed beasts is proof enough that they still have Six Paths chakra",

Kakashi, Minato, and Guy did a decent job of staying relevant right up until the ancient-alien/demon-woman Kaguya showed up in the finale. \n\nKakashi wasn't \"kick Naruto or Sauske's ass\" strong, but he was at least relevant to the fights. He also demolished all the reanimated war heroes he came up against, just playing whack-a-mole with dead legends.\n\nMinato was teleporting people, bombs, and mystical nonsense around the battlefield against Obito and Madara. Kaguya, actually even just Madara, made him useless; but he was hanging with late-game Obito Uchiha for a good while.\n\nMight Guy was the *only* non-alien character that nearly killed 10-tails Madara. Dude had to sacrifice his life for it, but that's still really impressive for someone from a more or less throwaway clan.  \n\nSakura was....present I guess. She didn't accomplish anything, but she was surprisingly durable I guess? I dunno, man, she really should have been immediately annihilated by Madara or Kaguya. Adult Sakura is a great example of someone who would have been ludicrously strong pre-Shippuden or at the start of Shippuden. She just fell victim to the power creep more than any of the other main characters.",

A more canon example would be the Shikamaru light novel implying that he still has it since he has the chakra of all nine tailed beasts (a requirement for obtaining it) and him flying when he fought Toneri in The Last. Naruto just never bothered using it similar to how Sasuke never used the Six Paths of Pain apart from the Deva and Preta Paths but him having complete mastery of the Rinnegan implies he could and just doesn't need to use all of them (his Susanoo's a much better option compared to the Asura and Animal Paths for example)\n\nAs for the truthseeking orbs, the common theory is that Naruto lost them when he fought Madara, then Kaguya, and eventually Sasuke.\n\nBoth Hokage Naruto and Supporting Kage Sasuke are way too powerful for non Otsutsuki opponents hence the shortage of feats suggesting they still have their Six Paths abilities outside the Momoshiki fight although Sasuke still having his Rinnegan and Naruto still having the chakra of all the tailed beasts is proof enough that they still have Six Paths chakra",

To make it to Jonin you have to be the cream of the crop, most ninja simply never get that far.\n\nProof is the size of the Allied Shinobi Alliance which stands at 80k, meaning about 16k ninja were from each village (I'm not sure the size of the samurai). \n\nWe only get to know maybe 100 ninja in the whole series. The group we see just happens to be the cream of the crop, they are the exception not the rule.",

He also demolished all the reanimated war heroes he came up against, just playing whack-a-mole with dead legends.\n\nMinato was teleporting people, bombs, and mystical nonsense around the battlefield against Obito and Madara. Kaguya, actually even just Madara, made him useless; but he was hanging with late-game Obito Uchiha for a good while.\n\nMight Guy was the *only* non-alien character that nearly killed 10-tails Madara. Dude had to sacrifice his life for it, but that's still really impressive for someone from a more or less throwaway clan.  \n\nSakura was....present I guess. She didn't accomplish anything, but she was surprisingly durable I guess? I dunno, man, she really should have been immediately annihilated by Madara or Kaguya. Adult Sakura is a great example of someone who would have been ludicrously strong pre-Shippuden or at the start of Shippuden. She just fell victim to the power creep more than any of the other main characters.",

A more canon example would be the Shikamaru light novel implying that he still has it since he has the chakra of all nine tailed beasts (a requirement for obtaining it) and him flying when he fought Toneri in The Last. Naruto just never bothered using it similar to how Sasuke never used the Six Paths of Pain apart from the Deva and Preta Paths but him having complete mastery of the Rinnegan implies he could and just doesn't need to use all of them (his Susanoo's a much better option compared to the Asura and Animal Paths for example)\n\nAs for the truthseeking orbs, the common theory is that Naruto lost them when he fought Madara, then Kaguya, and eventually Sasuke.\n\nBoth Hokage Naruto and Supporting Kage Sasuke are way too powerful for non Otsutsuki opponents hence the shortage of feats suggesting they still have their Six Paths abilities outside the Momoshiki fight although Sasuke still having his Rinnegan and Naruto still having the chakra of all the tailed beasts is proof enough that they still have Six Paths chakra",

Kakashi, Minato, and Guy did a decent job of staying relevant right up until the ancient-alien/demon-woman Kaguya showed up in the finale. \n\nKakashi wasn't \"kick Naruto or Sauske's ass\" strong, but he was at least relevant to the fights. He also demolished all the reanimated war heroes he came up against, just playing whack-a-mole with dead legends.\n\nMinato was teleporting people, bombs, and mystical nonsense around the battlefield against Obito and Madara. Kaguya, actually even just Madara, made him useless; but he was hanging with late-game Obito Uchiha for a good while.\n\nMight Guy was the *only* non-alien character that nearly killed 10-tails Madara. Dude had to sacrifice his life for it, but that's still really impressive for someone from a more or less throwaway clan.  \n\nSakura was....present I guess. She didn't accomplish anything, but she was surprisingly durable I guess? I dunno, man, she really should have been immediately annihilated by Madara or Kaguya. Adult Sakura is a great example of someone who would have been ludicrously strong pre-Shippuden or at the start of Shippuden. She just fell victim to the power creep more than any of the other main characters.",

A more canon example would be the Shikamaru light novel implying that he still has it since he has the chakra of all nine tailed beasts (a requirement for obtaining it) and him flying when he fought Toneri in The Last. Naruto just never bothered using it similar to how Sasuke never used the Six Paths of Pain apart from the Deva and Preta Paths but him having complete mastery of the Rinnegan implies he could and just doesn't need to use all of them (his Susanoo's a much better option compared to the Asura and Animal Paths for example)\n\nAs for the truthseeking orbs, the common theory is that Naruto lost them when he fought Madara, then Kaguya, and eventually Sasuke.\n\nBoth Hokage Naruto and Supporting Kage Sasuke are way too powerful for non Otsutsuki opponents hence the shortage of feats suggesting they still have their Six Paths abilities outside the Momoshiki fight although Sasuke still having his Rinnegan and Naruto still having the chakra of all the tailed beasts is proof enough that they still have Six Paths chakra",
