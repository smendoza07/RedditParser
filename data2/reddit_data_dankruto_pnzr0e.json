Uchiha massacre was valid since he did make a good point and they'd most likely try it again. Still should've tried shisuis plan though but shisui needed to die before the show to limit plot holes. Convincing hanzo(?) That the akasuki were villains wasn't exactly wrong either. By doing so, he had the chance to get rid of the biggest threats to his village. Danzo is a messed up fuck, but his actions, most atleast, weren't wrong for the time. He had selfish intent, but then again, so does Naruto and literally every other character in the show and people In real life. Danzo could've been the best villain in the show besides maybe madara, if he had his own saga.",

He says it to himself and even Karin acknowledges the only time Danzo actually exerts himself and uses his chakra is for the Wood jutsu because he couldn't avoid Susano's arrow any other way. He says it to himself as well that he's forced to use chakra and it's a setback. He was relying on the Izanagi to tire Sasuke out and he did succeed but Sasuke casting the genjutsu for the final Izanagi set him back a ways. He was severely weakened and with no Izanagi. Still he was strong enough to avoid a chidori from Sasuke and capture Karin which he would settle on Sasuke being weak hearted and take Karin hostage thinking after Sasuke gives up to spare Karin, Madara would step in and then use the eye. Instead Sasuke chooses to attack her and Danzo and at that point he was probably too weakened to use Shisui's eye and chose instead to get rid of them both with his final sealing jutsu.\n\nI just finished rewatching the fight. It's a lot better than people give credit. Definitely worth a rewatch imo. The only thing I didn't like was Sasuke screaming away Danzo's paralysis jutsu and Danzo taking the time to taunt him instead of just killing him right away . Cliche villain writing lol.",

Still I'll acknowledge Danzo's ability to just brush that off and even taunt him. He's not a real Uchiha and really not even a genius. Has futon...that's actually it. He has no special abilities other than the ones he had to steal and just through sheer planning was able to even put up a fight with an actual reincarnation of a god Uchiha. He planned so long how to fight even the strongest of the Uchiha it's almost like he was prepping for Madara all along.",

Convincing hanzo(?) That the akasuki were villains wasn't exactly wrong either. By doing so, he had the chance to get rid of the biggest threats to his village. Danzo is a messed up fuck, but his actions, most atleast, weren't wrong for the time. He had selfish intent, but then again, so does Naruto and literally every other character in the show and people In real life.

He says it to himself and even Karin acknowledges the only time Danzo actually exerts himself and uses his chakra is for the Wood jutsu because he couldn't avoid Susano's arrow any other way. He says it to himself as well that he's forced to use chakra and it's a setback. He was relying on the Izanagi to tire Sasuke out and he did succeed but Sasuke casting the genjutsu for the final Izanagi set him back a ways. He was severely weakened and with no Izanagi. Still he was strong enough to avoid a chidori from Sasuke and capture Karin which he would settle on Sasuke being weak hearted and take Karin hostage thinking after Sasuke gives up to spare Karin, Madara would step in and then use the eye. Instead Sasuke chooses to attack her and Danzo and at that point he was probably too weakened to use Shisui's eye and chose instead to get rid of them both with his final sealing jutsu.\n\nI just finished rewatching the fight. It's a lot better than people give credit. Definitely worth a rewatch imo. The only thing I didn't like was Sasuke screaming away Danzo's paralysis jutsu and Danzo taking the time to taunt him instead of just killing him right away . Cliche villain writing lol.",

Still I'll acknowledge Danzo's ability to just brush that off and even taunt him. He's not a real Uchiha and really not even a genius. Has futon...that's actually it. He has no special abilities other than the ones he had to steal and just through sheer planning was able to even put up a fight with an actual reincarnation of a god Uchiha. He planned so long how to fight even the strongest of the Uchiha it's almost like he was prepping for Madara all along.",

Convincing hanzo(?) That the akasuki were villains wasn't exactly wrong either. By doing so, he had the chance to get rid of the biggest threats to his village. Danzo is a messed up fuck, but his actions, most atleast, weren't wrong for the time. He had selfish intent, but then again, so does Naruto and literally every other character in the show and people In real life. Danzo could've been the best villain in the show besides maybe madara, if he had his own saga.",

He says it to himself and even Karin acknowledges the only time Danzo actually exerts himself and uses his chakra is for the Wood jutsu because he couldn't avoid Susano's arrow any other way. He says it to himself as well that he's forced to use chakra and it's a setback. He was relying on the Izanagi to tire Sasuke out and he did succeed but Sasuke casting the genjutsu for the final Izanagi set him back a ways. He was severely weakened and with no Izanagi. Still he was strong enough to avoid a chidori from Sasuke and capture Karin which he would settle on Sasuke being weak hearted and take Karin hostage thinking after Sasuke gives up to spare Karin, Madara would step in and then use the eye. Instead Sasuke chooses to attack her and Danzo and at that point he was probably too weakened to use Shisui's eye and chose instead to get rid of them both with his final sealing jutsu.\n\nI just finished rewatching the fight. It's a lot better than people give credit. Definitely worth a rewatch imo. The only thing I didn't like was Sasuke screaming away Danzo's paralysis jutsu and Danzo taking the time to taunt him instead of just killing him right away . Cliche villain writing lol.",

He says it to himself and even Karin acknowledges the only time Danzo actually exerts himself and uses his chakra is for the Wood jutsu because he couldn't avoid Susano's arrow any other way. He says it to himself as well that he's forced to use chakra and it's a setback. He was relying on the Izanagi to tire Sasuke out and he did succeed but Sasuke casting the genjutsu for the final Izanagi set him back a ways. He was severely weakened and with no Izanagi. Still he was strong enough to avoid a chidori from Sasuke and capture Karin which he would settle on Sasuke being weak hearted and take Karin hostage thinking after Sasuke gives up to spare Karin, Madara would step in and then use the eye. Instead Sasuke chooses to attack her and Danzo and at that point he was probably too weakened to use Shisui's eye and chose instead to get rid of them both with his final sealing jutsu.\n\nI just finished rewatching the fight. It's a lot better than people give credit. Definitely worth a rewatch imo. The only thing I didn't like was Sasuke screaming away Danzo's paralysis jutsu and Danzo taking the time to taunt him instead of just killing him right away . Cliche villain writing lol.",

He has no special abilities other than the ones he had to steal and just through sheer planning was able to even put up a fight with an actual reincarnation of a god Uchiha.

He says it to himself and even Karin acknowledges the only time Danzo actually exerts himself and uses his chakra is for the Wood jutsu because he couldn't avoid Susano's arrow any other way. He says it to himself as well that he's forced to use chakra and it's a setback. He was relying on the Izanagi to tire Sasuke out and he did succeed but Sasuke casting the genjutsu for the final Izanagi set him back a ways. He was severely weakened and with no Izanagi. Still he was strong enough to avoid a chidori from Sasuke and capture Karin which he would settle on Sasuke being weak hearted and take Karin hostage thinking after Sasuke gives up to spare Karin, Madara would step in and then use the eye. Instead Sasuke chooses to attack her and Danzo and at that point he was probably too weakened to use Shisui's eye and chose instead to get rid of them both with his final sealing jutsu.\n\nI just finished rewatching the fight. It's a lot better than people give credit. Definitely worth a rewatch imo. The only thing I didn't like was Sasuke screaming away Danzo's paralysis jutsu and Danzo taking the time to taunt him instead of just killing him right away . Cliche villain writing lol.",

Still I'll acknowledge Danzo's ability to just brush that off and even taunt him. He's not a real Uchiha and really not even a genius. Has futon...that's actually it. He has no special abilities other than the ones he had to steal and just through sheer planning was able to even put up a fight with an actual reincarnation of a god Uchiha. He planned so long how to fight even the strongest of the Uchiha it's almost like he was prepping for Madara all along.",

He says it to himself as well that he's forced to use chakra and it's a setback. He was relying on the Izanagi to tire Sasuke out and he did succeed but Sasuke casting the genjutsu for the final Izanagi set him back a ways. He was severely weakened and with no Izanagi. Still he was strong enough to avoid a chidori from Sasuke and capture Karin which he would settle on Sasuke being weak hearted and take Karin hostage thinking after Sasuke gives up to spare Karin, Madara would step in and then use the eye. Instead Sasuke chooses to attack her and Danzo and at that point he was probably too weakened to use Shisui's eye and chose instead to get rid of them both with his final sealing jutsu.\n\nI just finished rewatching the fight. It's a lot better than people give credit. Definitely worth a rewatch imo. The only thing I didn't like was Sasuke screaming away Danzo's paralysis jutsu and Danzo taking the time to taunt him instead of just killing him right away . Cliche villain writing lol.",

Still I'll acknowledge Danzo's ability to just brush that off and even taunt him. He's not a real Uchiha and really not even a genius. Has futon...that's actually it. He has no special abilities other than the ones he had to steal and just through sheer planning was able to even put up a fight with an actual reincarnation of a god Uchiha. He planned so long how to fight even the strongest of the Uchiha it's almost like he was prepping for Madara all along.",
