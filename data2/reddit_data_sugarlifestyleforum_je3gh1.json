    "body": "I recently got my first pap smear as a 30-something and found out that apparently doctors don't test for HPV until after you turn 30. I initially told her no need because I had the Gardasil vaccine in my teens and she replied that yes, while it blocks the most common ones it doesn't block all high risk strains. That seems like a big freaking deal, so I asked her why I haven't been tested for HPV before then. She told me it's typical for strains of HPV to clear up on its own within 1 to 2 years so they never bother testing 20-somethings other than to see if your pap smear is normal.\n\nA normal pap smear doesn't mean you're HPV negative though. It just means it hasn't evolved into cervical cancer or something indicating it might yet. You can have a normal pap smear and still be HPV positive. I asked her about testing for men (thinking my exes or clients and the likes would have told me) and she said it's wildly inaccurate for men unfortunately and there's other ways to get it other than intercourse.\n\nIdk about you, but this new information scared the shit out of me. My ex SD's primary partner (whom he dated while seeing me) had cervical cancer a year ago. I never made the connection that I might have something too until this all came up. Talking with him about this, it didn't even occur to him to tell me that I should consider looking into testing or that I also might have HPV. It didn't even register that I was also at risk until I called him asking about his partner and such.\n\nThink about the number of times SD's have asked you for bareback, probably saying they're clean but not knowing that they might not be. Think about if YOU might be positive and not know it yet because our medical system doesn't test young women for it below 30 years old. Think about how easy it is to contract HPV, not just with bare sex but even simply rubbing on the outside of our genitals (something that I find so many people like doing but that still transmits disease btw). Think about the heavy risk your married SD might be making for their wife... Because you're in your 20's and can probably clear it easily, but high risk strains could become cervical cancer for her. Or the next person your SD dates that's immunocompromised.\n\nAnd, much like my ex SD, think about the other risks he might have known about but didn't think it was important to tell you.\n\nSafe sex is a gift for you, your sugar daddy, and whomever else they're sexually active with. If they can't handle condoms because it's uncomfortable, they're really saying \"I prioritize my pleasure over your health.\"\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.\n\nEDIT: Thank you angry men in my DM's that are calling me a dumb money grabbing bitch that no one cares about. I put this up to inform women AND men of the risks they take to forego safe sex so they can make a better decision in their relationships. I did this to pass on the medical info that not everyone gets before they're 30 because most women won't talk to their doctors as much as I do and I strive to understand my health more each time I go.\n\nAlso my ex SD and his primary have been super supportive and want to hear back on results once I get them. His primary (whom I'm also friends with) gave him sooo much crap for not taking the lead on telling other partners about what they should do on their end while she was busy kicking the shit out of cancer, so I do feel this was more of an oversight through a dark time in their lives, albeit a grossly neglectful one on my ex SD's part. Despite it all, I do feel supported and cared for by both of them.\n\nEDIT2: The fact that so many of you are arguing that condoms don't 100% prevent HPV as if it's a valid reason not to wear condoms is appalling and disturbing. The fact that so many of you still cling to the idea that it doesn't matter and still put women at risk for so many things in the name of feeling better during sex is terrifying. If you are thinking this, that is literally why I made this post to begin with yo very clearly explain that you are risking more for everyone other than just your own comfort.\n\nEDIT3: Talking with someone here and with my doctor, the gap concern is in HPV vaccines getting updated. In 2014 they came out with a new HPV vaccine that covers many more of the high risk strains. If you had the HPV shot (Gardasil) prior to then but not another one afterwards, you might be at risk and should consider asking your doctor about getting the other dose. As someone mentioned below, you can get this vaccine anytime before the age of 45.",

The statistics aren't perfect.  That, however, is the rationale for not testing <30 as far as I am aware.",

It's certainly concerning but from what I gathered, it seems it's based on early relationship exposure: you're likely to contract it when younger, but your immune system is likely to clear it before it's a problem. You DO build an immunity to many of these strains once they're cleared, so if your body's just doing that on its own and not causing anything else of concern why test it? At least, that's probably how medical provider look at it on an individual level, not a multiple partners to think about level.",

They pinch off a piece of your cervix to test and that hurts, and then they put something on it to keep it clean and that sloughs off you eventually in a way that looks like a small grey alien slithered out of you and into your underwear. \n\nThis year, at 31, I had an ovarian cancer scare. Everything is fine, thank goodness, but ladies - you HAVE to look out for yourself. My SBF at the time of the colposcopy was great, but didn't understand the feelings I had about it. \n\nMedical providers know they'll have to fight insurance for abnormal tests, and at least I never learned what strain I had, so unless the big bad medical associations and CDC change their reccomendations for it, testing won't change.

It will tell you if they are pre cancerous or cancerous. \n\nI had it even after gardisil. Worst sex of my life at 19 (no joke! Super weird short scattered rhythm, no foreplay, came almost immediately). They scraped the cells and it was abnormal, not even pre cancerous.  I did a pap every 6 months until they cleared. They do say after you've cleared it, it is only recommended every 3 years. But being sexually active, I still test every year. And more reg. STDs tests more than that.\n\nThe main cause of cervical cancer IS hpv, but it only gets deadly if it goes untreated and undetected for years.  A friends mom died from Hpv because her husband cheated on her and she never got tested during those years. :(\n\nAnd you're absolutely correct in your statement about the shit message that is blared out when men ask for BB. Nope!! Not even worth it to me. No amount of $ is going to make getting an incurable STD worth  it. Never trust when someone stresses that they're safe, and don't opt out of condoms due to pressure, especially it you don't want to. Every man who told me they couldn't come with one.. guess what! They always came at least at least once :) get the thinnest condoms you can and use a sea of lube under and over the condom. If they are a bitch who says they can't maintain an erection with a condom on, just get a cock ring.",

We're not currently talking about every strain of HPV, I'm specifically talking about the 10-12 ones that are what they specifically tested me for once I was over 30 years old. This is why 70% of cervical cancer cases is relevant. I'm also not here to minimize your risk with HPV either, but the risks you talk about are more likely to happen via HIV for men than HPV, which also may contribute to why you and many other men are minimizing the risk of HPV.

I say this as a 100% condom use person, but HPV is a tricky one, as is herpes. \n\nIf you get any flack for asking for the vaccine, stand your ground. Unless there is an arguable reason you shouldn\u2019t (major immunocompromise, etc), the HPV vaccine is worth it. Worst case, it won\u2019t be a panacea for a strain you already have. Especially if you\u2019re under 45, you are within the CDC recommendations as of Oct 2018. Good luck!",

It's certainly concerning but from what I gathered, it seems it's based on early relationship exposure: you're likely to contract it when younger, but your immune system is likely to clear it before it's a problem. You DO build an immunity to many of these strains once they're cleared, so if your body's just doing that on its own and not causing anything else of concern why test it? At least, that's probably how medical provider look at it on an individual level, not a multiple partners to think about level.",

We're not currently talking about every strain of HPV, I'm specifically talking about the 10-12 ones that are what they specifically tested me for once I was over 30 years old. This is why 70% of cervical cancer cases is relevant. I'm also not here to minimize your risk with HPV either, but the risks you talk about are more likely to happen via HIV for men than HPV, which also may contribute to why you and many other men are minimizing the risk of HPV.

To forego a condom because you think getting or giving HPV is unavoidable even with a condom is irresponsible sex regardless of if that's enough to stop it.\n\nThird of all, this post is a PSA for women who don't know this about their sexual health (because, like me and another person on this post that said it, they don't tell you these things when you're a woman in your 20's) and as a PSA for men that have a false sense of security that bare sex isn't harming their clueless partners they're likely cheating on with their SB because \"you're both clean.\"\n\nDespite all of this, you still want me to consult you through how to approach safer sex with your partners, even though the easiest thing you can do to begin to mitigate risk is figure out what your best condom fit is so you can prevent intercourse as a likely way of spreading it?\n\nThen pay me very well to do that consultation.",

It's certainly concerning but from what I gathered, it seems it's based on early relationship exposure: you're likely to contract it when younger, but your immune system is likely to clear it before it's a problem. You DO build an immunity to many of these strains once they're cleared, so if your body's just doing that on its own and not causing anything else of concern why test it? At least, that's probably how medical provider look at it on an individual level, not a multiple partners to think about level.",

It wouldn\u2019t matter if HPV is responsible for 100% of cervical cancer, the added risk to a vaccinated woman of not using condoms for PIV is still low.

We're not currently talking about every strain of HPV, I'm specifically talking about the 10-12 ones that are what they specifically tested me for once I was over 30 years old. This is why 70% of cervical cancer cases is relevant. I'm also not here to minimize your risk with HPV either, but the risks you talk about are more likely to happen via HIV for men than HPV, which also may contribute to why you and many other men are minimizing the risk of HPV.

I say this as a 100% condom use person, but HPV is a tricky one, as is herpes. \n\nIf you get any flack for asking for the vaccine, stand your ground. Unless there is an arguable reason you shouldn\u2019t (major immunocompromise, etc), the HPV vaccine is worth it. Worst case, it won\u2019t be a panacea for a strain you already have. Especially if you\u2019re under 45, you are within the CDC recommendations as of Oct 2018. Good luck!",

To forego a condom because you think getting or giving HPV is unavoidable even with a condom is irresponsible sex regardless of if that's enough to stop it.\n\nThird of all, this post is a PSA for women who don't know this about their sexual health (because, like me and another person on this post that said it, they don't tell you these things when you're a woman in your 20's) and as a PSA for men that have a false sense of security that bare sex isn't harming their clueless partners they're likely cheating on with their SB because \"you're both clean.\"\n\nDespite all of this, you still want me to consult you through how to approach safer sex with your partners, even though the easiest thing you can do to begin to mitigate risk is figure out what your best condom fit is so you can prevent intercourse as a likely way of spreading it?\n\nThen pay me very well to do that consultation.",

I do think that everyone should minimize your risk, but if you are someone that has more than 5 partners in their lifetime, it\u2019s almost certain you will get HPV. 90% of women get it in their lifetime. In the sugar world, even with condoms, there are a lot of people having multiple partners. Condom or not, I think most of us will get some form of it at least temporarily. It\u2019s borderline unavoidable \n\nWear condoms and it\u2019s good you shared this info, but I think we\u2019re really going to have to cut down on our partner number too if we are going to deal with this",

Everything is fine, thank goodness, but ladies - you HAVE to look out for yourself. My SBF at the time of the colposcopy was great, but didn't understand the feelings I had about it. \n\nMedical providers know they'll have to fight insurance for abnormal tests, and at least I never learned what strain I had, so unless the big bad medical associations and CDC change their reccomendations for it, testing won't change.

I am not going to look up the stats for you but I believe that the relatively low risk multiplied by the relatively small additional protection that using condoms for PIV would add make this a small additional risk.  \n\nYour 70% of cervical cancer cases comment is completely irrelevant to the argument.   It wouldn\u2019t matter if HPV is responsible for 100% of cervical cancer, the added risk to a vaccinated woman of not using condoms for PIV is still low.  And before you turn this into a \u201cSDs don\u2019t care about women\u201d argument, HPV causes penile and anal cancer in men.  That doesn\u2019t change the facts.",

We're not currently talking about every strain of HPV, I'm specifically talking about the 10-12 ones that are what they specifically tested me for once I was over 30 years old. This is why 70% of cervical cancer cases is relevant. I'm also not here to minimize your risk with HPV either, but the risks you talk about are more likely to happen via HIV for men than HPV, which also may contribute to why you and many other men are minimizing the risk of HPV.

I say this as a 100% condom use person, but HPV is a tricky one, as is herpes. \n\nIf you get any flack for asking for the vaccine, stand your ground. Unless there is an arguable reason you shouldn\u2019t (major immunocompromise, etc), the HPV vaccine is worth it. Worst case, it won\u2019t be a panacea for a strain you already have. Especially if you\u2019re under 45, you are within the CDC recommendations as of Oct 2018. Good luck!",

It wouldn\u2019t matter if HPV is responsible for 100% of cervical cancer, the added risk to a vaccinated woman of not using condoms for PIV is still low.

We're not currently talking about every strain of HPV, I'm specifically talking about the 10-12 ones that are what they specifically tested me for once I was over 30 years old. This is why 70% of cervical cancer cases is relevant. I'm also not here to minimize your risk with HPV either, but the risks you talk about are more likely to happen via HIV for men than HPV, which also may contribute to why you and many other men are minimizing the risk of HPV.

I say this as a 100% condom use person, but HPV is a tricky one, as is herpes. \n\nIf you get any flack for asking for the vaccine, stand your ground. Unless there is an arguable reason you shouldn\u2019t (major immunocompromise, etc), the HPV vaccine is worth it. Worst case, it won\u2019t be a panacea for a strain you already have. Especially if you\u2019re under 45, you are within the CDC recommendations as of Oct 2018. Good luck!",

I do think that everyone should minimize your risk, but if you are someone that has more than 5 partners in their lifetime, it\u2019s almost certain you will get HPV. 90% of women get it in their lifetime. In the sugar world, even with condoms, there are a lot of people having multiple partners. Condom or not, I think most of us will get some form of it at least temporarily. It\u2019s borderline unavoidable \n\nWear condoms and it\u2019s good you shared this info, but I think we\u2019re really going to have to cut down on our partner number too if we are going to deal with this",

We're not currently talking about every strain of HPV, I'm specifically talking about the 10-12 ones that are what they specifically tested me for once I was over 30 years old. This is why 70% of cervical cancer cases is relevant. I'm also not here to minimize your risk with HPV either, but the risks you talk about are more likely to happen via HIV for men than HPV, which also may contribute to why you and many other men are minimizing the risk of HPV.
