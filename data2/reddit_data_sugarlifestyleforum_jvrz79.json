    "body": "I'm triggered - I have seen rash of posts recently and its too much for me\n\nPlease stop. Platonic means NO sex. Of ANY kind. No hand jobs, no oral, no anal, no French kissing, no fondling. No Nothing. No exchanging of bodily fluids. Or any sexual activity.\n\nPlease stop trying to massage, finesse, corrupt, and/or re-define that word. Instead why don't *you* be clear and say I only do: X or anything but: Y - \n\n if you actually mean NO SEXUAL ACTIVITY AT ALL then yes, please feel free to use the word: Platonic.\n\nand I've also seen \"mostly platonic\" or \"a little platonic\" -- NOPE. No. Nyet!\n\nPlatonic, much like pregnant, is either you are or you are not. Can't be a little pregnant. Can't be mostly pregnant.\n\nIf you want to take it slow leading up to intimacy, then again, it's not platonic - it's taking it slow. You could say \" I want a platonic friendship until I feel comfortable to engage\" - but that's still not really platonic as your goal is to be intimate.\n\nSorry, I just can't take all these posts, and frankly I am a bit tired of the corruption of words. It's not an evolution of language.\n\nAnd lastly I would argue - if you can not clearly communicate exactly what you want and feel... you are going to have a harder time in the bowl and in life itself.\n\nFully prepared to get flamed but there you go. Party on.",

Every single girl. I think a guy might consider taking a platonic girl out a few times but then stop after realizing he\u2019s not going to get any action. \n\nI know a girl who had a sugar daddy that would give her a nice allowance just to go on dates with him. Nothing sexual, no nudes, just dates once a week. She said he was a lot older, his wife passed away, and was extremely lonely and desperate and just wanted company. There are men out there like this but they are the exception.",

Plus it\u2019s usually spelt ie as in handie which also alerts the reader that it\u2019s not the typical meaning. \n\nThe only way this stops is if we stop it. And we should.

The definition of platonic is accurate. Yes the world is Not black and white, but language is by definition. It defines how we communicate as a species - if we just change meaning Willy nilly then what\u2019s the point of language. \n\nFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge was a criminal charge dating back to the 1600\u2019s. It was shortened and evolved to Fuck meaning intercourse (as well as its pejoratives). iF a small group stated using the word fuck to mean: sitting on a couch holding hands while we watch Netflix we\u2019d all be in trouble understanding. This corruption of platonic isn\u2019t much different. \n\nKissing is sexual. Have you never seen Monty Python\u2019s Meaning Of Life?? (What\u2019s wrong with a kiss? How about a kiss boy before you go stampeding off to the clitoris) \n\nI\u2019m not talking about a kiss hello, get ice cream, walk in the park, and then a kiss goodbye. You using that is a strawman argument. Massages can be depending on the scenario and you used intimate to describe it. That is a scenario that I wouldn\u2019t call platonic but I guess could be. I get massages all the time and it\u2019s not intimate at the spa. \n\nBill Clinton\u2019s bullshit excuse wasn\u2019t a new one. Men have been using that to lessen their betrayals. It\u2019s crap. Oh come on honey, I just put my dick in her mouth, it\u2019s not like we had sex or anything. Utter and compete shite! \n\nYes there is space between casual acquaintance and lover\u2014 it\u2019s called friend! And that\u2019s what platonic is. A friendship without sexual activity. \n\nI have a friend, Jen. I have wanted to sleep with her since I\u2019ve know her. She isn\u2019t interested at all. Guess what? We have a platonic friendship. We\u2019ve never kissed, made out, given each other a massage, etc. my best friend is Steve. Neither of us have ever kissed, made out, etc. guess what? Our friendship is platonic. That\u2019s what platonic means. \n\nThe arguments that you made I think give way to that muddying up of the waters that I was speaking about. \n\nI understand your reply, I\u2019m just saying that it leads to and helps the messiness that is a huge part of this board and it\u2019s replies.",

The definition of platonic is accurate. Yes the world is Not black and white, but language is by definition. It defines how we communicate as a species - if we just change meaning Willy nilly then what\u2019s the point of language. \n\nFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge was a criminal charge dating back to the 1600\u2019s. It was shortened and evolved to Fuck meaning intercourse (as well as its pejoratives). iF a small group stated using the word fuck to mean: sitting on a couch holding hands while we watch Netflix we\u2019d all be in trouble understanding. This corruption of platonic isn\u2019t much different. \n\nKissing is sexual. Have you never seen Monty Python\u2019s Meaning Of Life?? (What\u2019s wrong with a kiss? How about a kiss boy before you go stampeding off to the clitoris) \n\nI\u2019m not talking about a kiss hello, get ice cream, walk in the park, and then a kiss goodbye. You using that is a strawman argument. Massages can be depending on the scenario and you used intimate to describe it. That is a scenario that I wouldn\u2019t call platonic but I guess could be. I get massages all the time and it\u2019s not intimate at the spa. \n\nBill Clinton\u2019s bullshit excuse wasn\u2019t a new one. Men have been using that to lessen their betrayals. It\u2019s crap. Oh come on honey, I just put my dick in her mouth, it\u2019s not like we had sex or anything. Utter and compete shite! \n\nYes there is space between casual acquaintance and lover\u2014 it\u2019s called friend! And that\u2019s what platonic is. A friendship without sexual activity. \n\nI have a friend, Jen. I have wanted to sleep with her since I\u2019ve know her. She isn\u2019t interested at all. Guess what? We have a platonic friendship. We\u2019ve never kissed, made out, given each other a massage, etc. my best friend is Steve. Neither of us have ever kissed, made out, etc. guess what? Our friendship is platonic. That\u2019s what platonic means. \n\nThe arguments that you made I think give way to that muddying up of the waters that I was speaking about. \n\nI understand your reply, I\u2019m just saying that it leads to and helps the messiness that is a huge part of this board and it\u2019s replies.",
