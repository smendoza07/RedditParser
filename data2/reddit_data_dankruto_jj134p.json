For example when I was reading bleach I was finding it really difficult to actually understand what was happening during a fight but it was fine otherwise.

Gotta Know! was one of, if not the funniest episode in the original show, and it along with other original series filler gave the characters (especially Sasuke) important downtime to feel fleshed out. And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

For example when I was reading bleach I was finding it really difficult to actually understand what was happening during a fight but it was fine otherwise. It's the same with Naruto, fight scenes don't have the same effect for me while reading, animation helps a lot with that. But yeah for pacing manga would be much much better",

And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

Gotta Know! was one of, if not the funniest episode in the original show, and it along with other original series filler gave the characters (especially Sasuke) important downtime to feel fleshed out. And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

Gotta Know! was one of, if not the funniest episode in the original show, and it along with other original series filler gave the characters (especially Sasuke) important downtime to feel fleshed out. And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

For example when I was reading bleach I was finding it really difficult to actually understand what was happening during a fight but it was fine otherwise. It's the same with Naruto, fight scenes don't have the same effect for me while reading, animation helps a lot with that. But yeah for pacing manga would be much much better",

Gotta Know! was one of, if not the funniest episode in the original show, and it along with other original series filler gave the characters (especially Sasuke) important downtime to feel fleshed out. And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

Gotta Know! was one of, if not the funniest episode in the original show, and it along with other original series filler gave the characters (especially Sasuke) important downtime to feel fleshed out. And in the second series, the show benefits from the 12 Guardian Shinobi arc as it develops Asuma to a point where his death actually feels impactful, and other filler later into the series make a lot of the series simpler and more *fun*, especially when it becomes thematically darker.\n\nI know I\u2019m contradicting myself a little but some filler is legitimately good and benefits the show. When a remake comes out, it shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filler arcs entirely; it should be used to fix the series\u2019 pacing problems and animation problems more than anything else.",

The first 60 or so chapters were good but then the writer got fired and kishimoto starter writing it and made it a completely aimless garbage.
