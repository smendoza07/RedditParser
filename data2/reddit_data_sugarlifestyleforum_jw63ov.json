    "body": "\nJust a quick ramble \n\nDinner went like this:\nNice hellos and fun start.\nStarted getting quiet when we sat down.\nStart noticing POT was extremely boring and poor table manners. \nRealized, I, myself, a hilarious and fun person, carried the whole entire conversation to make him feel comfortable and to open up. POT opens up more, saying he\u2019s stressed and work has been chaotic. Tells me about work.\nWe talk more. Nice laughs and took his mind off of work.\nStarted asking each other questions about the arrangement to come to an agreement. (At this point he\u2019s nice but I want to next this guy, but still giving a small benefit of the doubt).\nTopic of sex has been going smoothly, then he brings up condoms.\n\nHere\u2019s when things get uncomfortable (to him at least. It was quite humorous to me).\n\nI said \u201cI prefer to use condoms.\u201d\nHe says \u201cwhat if I provide an STD test\u201d\nI told him no because I don\u2019t even know him\nHe confirms \u201cso no?\u201d\n\u201cNo :/\u201c\nSo now he\u2019s upset and the table just got extremely quiet and the silence carried on for over 2-3 minutes. He pulls out his phone. \nI see where this is leading as men I\u2019ve encountered in vanilla relationships act when they can\u2019t get what they want.\nI pull out my phone as well since he\u2019s being rude, I, myself should as well. \nAt this point okay, I\u2019m going to next this mf.\nI make humor of the situation to conclude we\u2019re not going to move forward. \nThen he goes on this spiel of women being high maintenance and he\u2019s extremely disappointed in my response and tries to guilt trip me HEAVILY. \nI stand firm on my ground with a smile. The silence continues. \nI\u2019m over it at this point and offer to split the check so we can go our separate ways.\nHe scratches his head and says okay and say women expect so much (we went on a $$ dinner btw lol)\nWe split the check and I pull out my card and gave it to the waitress. He hasn\u2019t taken his card out yet. Waitress takes my portion of the check. \nHe says \u201cyou know usually when I say if I provide my STD results 99% would agree to it.. but I guess there\u2019s always that 1%. It\u2019s such a shame, I liked your presence\u201d\nWaitress comes back. He pulls out his card. \nI gave him a nice fist bump on the arm and left. \n\nYou can\u2019t expect me to carry the conversation, then say women are high maintenance and allow you to raw dog me? Out of your mind!\n\nEdit: typos",
