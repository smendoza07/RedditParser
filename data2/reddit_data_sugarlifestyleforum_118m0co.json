    "body": "I\u2019m fairly young compared to most SDs (36), and surprisingly it seems pretty hard to find a baby that fits what I\u2019m looking for. \n\nI feel as if I\u2019m looked at as marriage/boyfriend material (not saying that\u2019s bad thing, just not exactly what I\u2019m looking for at the moment.) and girls get very very attached. Is this an age thing or am I not setting the right boundaries? I don\u2019t want to make any relationship feel transactional, but to be blunt we are both in this for a -reason-. I don\u2019t mind dates, trips, and all the other lavish things that come with this kind of relationship, but overall I just want to have lots of fun with NO strings attached.\n\nJust venting here because my last baby decided to crash her car because I didn\u2019t answer a few calls. I thought I made it clear I was NOT her \u201cboyfriend\u201d and am allowed to have a life outside of her.\n\nAny other young SDs have this issue?",

I don't mean to stigmatize mental health, to the contrary, I think their behaviour was caused by heavy antidepressant use, then coming off it suddenly.  \nWhat I believe happened, at least in one case, is that the SB used the allowance I gave her to over medicate on antidepressants (she took something called Trinelix if I remember correctly), then experienced some kind of withdrawal when she couldn't get it anymore.    \nDo I support suddenly stopping the use of medicine that clearly causes addiction. Fuck no. Any doctor would strongly advise against that.  I also wouldn't fund the addiction, hence the suicide threats. That's as good of an explanation as I can give.",

If they are in fact older than there are some serious underlying issues. \n\nI do hope you will not give this person a second chance and remove them from your life\u2026 but that decision is alone is yours to make. \n\nThinking back to myself in my early 20s I was definitely wild and lacked emotional maturity. While I would never crash a car or do something so petty and dangerous and toxic, I would however become attached easily.\n\nNow that I\u2019m 30, I really realize the value of money and time. Over the last few years I finally had a grasp of it. That\u2019s something I knew nothing about when I was younger and it\u2019s something that I find to be crucial in these types of dynamics. If you aren\u2019t already I\u2019d be looking at age ranges  late 20s to early 30s. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to really make your needs and intentions known before hand. Setting hard boundaries is necessary so people who are looking for attachment, won\u2019t consider you to fit that role. Of course it\u2019s possibly some will over look that or become unintentionally attached but I do think it will weed out the ones too emotionally involved. \n\nGood luck OP, I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.",

Just as they are giving you exactly what you want, you are giving them many things they want. I have had several SB's I could have spun up (of at least short term) relationships up with. This I ascribe to the fact that, despite age, I am described as being not horribly harsh on the eyes and take good care of myself, I am very warm and loving to them, and I make myself available to them a lot (no car crashing so far, lol), but via text, not calling, also because d/s is itself a form of relationship that can be very close. \n\nIf i were running into this, I would screen for an SB that either has some sort of relationship ongoing, or one that describes (as many do) the \"you stay in your life, I stay in mine\" in whatever language they use, or both.",

I have found that feelings of attachment can happen with any SD/SB of any age assuming that both are entering into the relationship with a good mentality (i.e. not looking to take advantage of the other). Men and women will develop feelings when they find their needs are being taken care of, when they're being taken care of. It's natural. Now, if you're finding yourself with SBs that are prone to overly dramatic flair then it isn't an age thing, it's a you thing. You have a type and you are either consciously or subconsciously going after those that you recognize as prone to be attracted to you and prone to be clingy/needy and have that dramatic flair. Maybe you even like the drama, it fulfills a need in you to be needed/wanted.",

Prior to sugar,  I've been there.  Always holding out hope for more, thinking it will happen.  The sugar, for me, tells me,  it will never be more than what it currently is and for my life right now, I'm fine with that. \n\nSome people,  men and women,  want what they want and seem to think if they hold on,  eventually an epiphany will happen and the other person will realize they want more too. Because of this, they don't hear you clearly stating it is just what it is. Sorry you have to go through this.",

I have a friend who quit dating sugar daddies because she kept falling too hard for them. On the other hand though I have a friend who all of her sugar daddies fall in love with HER and she's the one scared and getting harassed with phone calls and such. What a strange life. Good luck!!! I'm sure you'll find a great match some day :)",

I need some financial support and, hopefully, some mentoring, other than that, I don't enter any arrangement to meet a life partner, but you never know. It is quite sad that women are still relying on a man to sort their entire life rather than carving their own paths. Looking for that fairytale that's been spoon-fed to us since we were children, but that's how blind-sighted we still are today. Every day, \"normal\" people make up the bulk of humanity and the high-flying life style generally comes to people who have earned it, I think both mass and social media etc has a fair amount of responsibility on its shoulders. On the other hand, from my experience of using the site on and off for a number of years, I experience so many men that use the space for their sexual kinks, there's nothing wrong with having or enjoying a kink. I have been highly sexualised to the point where a mere two sentences into the conversation it's all about what kind of sex I like, whether I'm submissive things of that nature. Again, I fully understand the nature of the site, but I feel like some of the men are looking for a sex worker and not a sugar baby or \"company\" as they put it!\n\nI think just keep reaffirming the nature of the relationship and you'll be fine!",
