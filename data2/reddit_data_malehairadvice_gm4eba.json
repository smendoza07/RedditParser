Blowdry in the morning after your shower the general direction you want it to go (and sometimes a little in the opposite direction to give it 'lift') until it's basically completely dry, then put american crew forming cream in it. Mat some in the sides and smooth them down. I think you'll be happy with the results.",

Look up some videos on YouTube about how it works and how to use it and see if it\u2019s right for you. That\u2019s what I did and I bought a small bottle of it to try. Will definitely buy more but I think I want to experiment with some other brands.

No need to be a smartass. \n\nTo answer the guys question of what product, I\u2019d say use a sea salt spray, and Moroccan oil when you get out of the shower and massage that through your hair, then use a hairdryer and blow it into this general shape. Once that\u2019s done I\u2019d use maybe a forming cream or pomade? I\u2019d say play around with some different options, no harm in experimenting.",

If you're using that, you need to condition your hair everytime you use it. I love the spray. The texture it gives. Oh my god. Love it but if you don't condition after every use at the end of the day or better still, when you reach that moment of the day when you don't care if your hair looks good. It dries your hair out big time.",
