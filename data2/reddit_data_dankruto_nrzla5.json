The Uchiha's existence was already in danger.\n\nAlso he didn't report that who he thought was Madara was lurking around the village. It was reasonable to assume he caused Kurama to rampage since Madara controlled him before.\n\nItachi didn't report anything as an Akatsuki otherwise Jiraiya would have known a lot about them. He only knew they existed prior to meeting Itachi because he followed Orochimaru's trail.",

The Byakugan can see clearly over a long distance so they could have them watch Itachi. They'd still have to get close to listen but being able to see through walls would make it easy to remain undetected.",
