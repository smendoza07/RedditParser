    "body": "Long story short i was meeting up with a POT SD and saw a \u201chidden\u201d camera aimed directly at his bed.. we did not discuss recording or cameras at all so I thought I was seeing things at first until it was beyond reasonable doubt. \n\nAfter chatting with him I could sense his nervousness and paranoia, and I noticed he was very cautious and aware of his movements as to not disturb or misplace the camera. I was trying to decide if I wanted to confront him with it right then, or get my allowance and ghost/block him. \n\nI asked for my allowance after chatting on the bed drinking a beer for about half an hour when he started rubbing my back (cringe) and got out of there by making an excuse saying I need to get my charger out of my car.  \n\nhe then texted me saying \u201cI guess you\u2019re gone\u201d I said \u201cNext time don\u2019t prop your hidden camera in plain view\u201d. \nThis was two nights ago and I haven\u2019t heard from him since.\n\nBE CAREFUL ladies! I\u2019m a little shaken up but I\u2019m so grateful I kept a watchful eye and went with my gut.",

Good Sugar Daddies deal with being rinsed, insulted, and ghosted every day. Good Sugar Babies deal with being ghosted, insulted, and the potential for physical harm.

If someone gets a PPM its not for 30 minutes of their time. She clearly cashed and dashed him regardless of his intent. Two wrongs dont make a right. Him doing something wrong, does not give the green light for her to defraud or steal from him.\n\nLet's see how this could go. Imagine if you will, this guy had more sinister intentions, lets say he groped her or tried to push her down, now lets say that she got the money and ran out the door, then called the police and tried to say she was attacked. Now he counters and said that never happened, in fact, she stole from me. Who are the cops going to believe if she has no marks on her? Stealing is wrong no matter what the A-hole did. Its not justified and could have backfired on her, especially if he was a pyscho and not just a creep.\n\n> *He didn\u2019t ask for consent to record, therefore the terms of consent would\u2019ve been breached.

No different if he hired a professional cuddler and if she ran out the door. He gave a women money to spend the night with him, and she left after getting her money. \n\nDo you think you can go to jail if you steal money from Drug Dealers..?

If someone gets a PPM its not for 30 minutes of their time. She clearly cashed and dashed him regardless of his intent. Two wrongs dont make a right. Him doing something wrong, does not give the green light for her to defraud or steal from him.\n\nLet's see how this could go. Imagine if you will, this guy had more sinister intentions, lets say he groped her or tried to push her down, now lets say that she got the money and ran out the door, then called the police and tried to say she was attacked. Now he counters and said that never happened, in fact, she stole from me. Who are the cops going to believe if she has no marks on her? Stealing is wrong no matter what the A-hole did. Its not justified and could have backfired on her, especially if he was a pyscho and not just a creep.\n\n> *He didn\u2019t ask for consent to record, therefore the terms of consent would\u2019ve been breached. That would be sexual assault\n\nThis has nothing to do with anything related to my point.",

No different if he hired a professional cuddler and if she ran out the door. He gave a women money to spend the night with him, and she left after getting her money. \n\nDo you think you can go to jail if you steal money from Drug Dealers..?

If someone gets a PPM its not for 30 minutes of their time. She clearly cashed and dashed him regardless of his intent. Two wrongs dont make a right. Him doing something wrong, does not give the green light for her to defraud or steal from him.\n\nLet's see how this could go. Imagine if you will, this guy had more sinister intentions, lets say he groped her or tried to push her down, now lets say that she got the money and ran out the door, then called the police and tried to say she was attacked. Now he counters and said that never happened, in fact, she stole from me. Who are the cops going to believe if she has no marks on her? Stealing is wrong no matter what the A-hole did. Its not justified and could have backfired on her, especially if he was a pyscho and not just a creep.\n\n> *He didn\u2019t ask for consent to record, therefore the terms of consent would\u2019ve been breached.

Covert filming was not included in the arrangements. She only agreed to a private encounter.  She had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a hotel room.  She wasn't onstage at Carnegie Hall.  All her negotiations were done in good faith and she was committed to fulfilling her end of the deal.\n\nAll of his negotiations were done in bad faith.  He deliberately left out his most significant intention.  He misled her from Day 1. He did not disclose his actual intentions either during the arrangement negotiations or when she arrived.  He was intentionally dishonest about his intentions and misled her from the get-go because he knew that if he were truthful about his intentions it likely would result in her either flat-out refusing or demanding a much larger gratuity than what he negotiated. \n\nYou want to make a porno, hire a porn star. Don't try and pull such an atrocious act on a kid.  Her whole life could be negatively affected by what he was planning to do to her. He is a total piece of shit.\n\nHe was trying to screw her over 7 ways from Sunday and got caught red-handed.  The idea of him being due a pro rata refund is laughable.",

If someone gets a PPM its not for 30 minutes of their time. She clearly cashed and dashed him regardless of his intent. Two wrongs dont make a right. Him doing something wrong, does not give the green light for her to defraud or steal from him.\n\nLet's see how this could go. Imagine if you will, this guy had more sinister intentions, lets say he groped her or tried to push her down, now lets say that she got the money and ran out the door, then called the police and tried to say she was attacked. Now he counters and said that never happened, in fact, she stole from me. Who are the cops going to believe if she has no marks on her? Stealing is wrong no matter what the A-hole did. Its not justified and could have backfired on her, especially if he was a pyscho and not just a creep.\n\n> *He didn\u2019t ask for consent to record, therefore the terms of consent would\u2019ve been breached.

No different if he hired a professional cuddler and if she ran out the door. He gave a women money to spend the night with him, and she left after getting her money. \n\nDo you think you can go to jail if you steal money from Drug Dealers..?

If someone gets a PPM its not for 30 minutes of their time. She clearly cashed and dashed him regardless of his intent. Two wrongs dont make a right. Him doing something wrong, does not give the green light for her to defraud or steal from him.\n\nLet's see how this could go. Imagine if you will, this guy had more sinister intentions, lets say he groped her or tried to push her down, now lets say that she got the money and ran out the door, then called the police and tried to say she was attacked. Now he counters and said that never happened, in fact, she stole from me. Who are the cops going to believe if she has no marks on her? Stealing is wrong no matter what the A-hole did. Its not justified and could have backfired on her, especially if he was a pyscho and not just a creep.\n\n> *He didn\u2019t ask for consent to record, therefore the terms of consent would\u2019ve been breached.

No different if he hired a professional cuddler and if she ran out the door. He gave a women money to spend the night with him, and she left after getting her money. \n\nDo you think you can go to jail if you steal money from Drug Dealers..? Stealing is still stealing no matter what the circumstances are!",
