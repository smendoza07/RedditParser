    "body": "There is so little real advice here and it is incredibly disappointing.  I've been scrolling through pages of submissions and it seems like any request for help either gets a handful of one-sentence comments/jokes that rarely add anything, or just flat out ignored.\n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/4iebrw/how_to_style_your_hair_like_this/) is currently at the top of the front page.  Go ahead and look through the comments.  At the time of posting, only **4 of the 52 comments** attempt to help the OP.  The rest?  Jokes about how you need good genetics or how attractive the guy is.\n\nI've looked through the top submissions hoping for some good discussions and tips, but half of the posts are jokes/funny pictures, and the rest are just pictures showing off their nice haircut (save for a few here and there).\n\nThis subreddit is called male hair ***ADVICE.***  People come here for help and you consistently let them down.  You guys should be ashamed of yourselves for doing this to your community, and the moderators should take a serious look at how they manage this place.  Because at the moment, this sub is absolute garbage.",

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

When I run out of that (soon) I'll be looking into different shampoos and conditioners.\n\nSo, if you wash and condition every day, try to cut back.  If you don't, check out some other shampoos and conditioners.  I'm assuming one that emphasizes hydration or something similar will help with the fluffiness.  If none of those work you could look into some serums or similar products to put into your hair after your shower.  Sorry, I don't really have a lot of experience with different types of products :\\  I'm hoping to try some out soon though.",

So this is not going to be a satisfying mod reply. Candidness is about all I can offer.\n\nThe sub is a clusterfuck. There's so much vitriol that gets thrown around amongst the users, 95% of our daily work on the sub is just removing comments and banning people. That's not to say we haven't tried...\n\nMonths ago, probably approaching a year by now really, we added more mods, had a few meetings, and strategized ways to make this place better. One of our guys made up some weekly thread ideas, I came up with some new rules, created a [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/0d5KXFqmjo4UU4U3), etc etc. We posted threads about them asking for feedback and comments. We even implemented some of it. No one cared. No one even noticed. The special topical weekly threads got on average 1 reply each. The post asking for input on the new rules was *criticized* for linking to a google doc and got like 7 comments total.\n\nSo we tried. We really did. I can't speak for the other mods, but I can speak for myself. I have no idea what this place needs. I've just about given up trying to fix it, because I don't see that the majority of the users even care. They certainly don't care enough to help the mods when we ask for feedback. They don't care enough to not call people \"faggots\" or tell each other to quit being fat or ugly or whatever other terrible shit we have to fight every single day. They just don't care.\n\nYou guys say you care. That's good! I like caring! Give me ideas. Should I start a modsticky for y'all to post in with ideas? Cause like, legit, I'd love for some input from people who are as passionate about /r/MHA as I used to be.\n\n**EDIT 2: One issue I see is that we have, to my knowledge, zero hair stylists on the moderation team here. :/**\n\n**EDIT 3 (2:20am Mountain Time): I'm going to sleep now. I'll check in again tomorrow. Probably something like 8-14 hours from now, depending on how my day goes. Kinda busy, but I'll be back to follow up with y'all. Promise.**\n\n**EDIT 4 (1:58pm Mountain Time): I'm back. Gonna start responding to everyone now. Let's keep the discussion rolling.**\n\n**EDIT 5 (3:03pm Mountain Time): I've replied to almost everyone now, and we're getting the other mods involved. I'm going to summarize the changes people have suggested below.**\n\n**EDIT 7 (4:12pm Mountain Time): Gonna step away for a bit for a home improvement project with my roomie. Back in a couple hours.**\n\n****\n#**Suggested Changes**\n\n1. **More transparent and stricter moderation** - We've tried this before, but there was very little community interest in vetting our proposed changes. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit) to see the proposed changes to the Rules and Moderator Code of Conduct. We NEEEEEEEED your input to refine this draft.\n\n2. **Self posts only** - We tried this once before and everyone rioted for that week. We're likely going to reimplement this, despite how much bitching ends up happening.\n\n3. **Require replies to help request threads to focus on the hair** - Too often, people focus on the fact that the model in the pictures is naturally attractive, or very fit, or whatever else. \"Lose weight\", \"be attractive\" etc are not constructive, and we need to heavily moderate this kind of misplaced focus in the replies our help request threads receive.\n\n4. **Flair for stylists, product vendor representatives, youtube personalities, knowledgeable amateurs, etc** - This will greatly help people find constructive replies within a thread, and will hopefully cultivate a strong culture of reliable information. We'll likely develop a system for applying to get your flair or something in the near future. We'll also need /u/waynenameyo1 to develop the CSS for that.\n\n5. **Reimplement the daily/weekly topical threads, and advertise the shit out of them.** - We did this a long while ago, but nobody used them. I feel like that is likely our fault for not moderating the sub more strictly and forcing people to use them.\n\n6. **Make known the existence of our [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/0d5KXFqmjo4UU4U3)** - This wasn't really a suggestion, but I feel like it'll help the community. I wanna get all the mods in there, and then start bringing users in and create a more rapid discourse. [Here's the invite code](https://discord.gg/0d5KXFqmjo4UU4U3)!\n\n7. **AMAs with product vendors, stylists, etc** - For like, some actual content. Weird concept right?\n\n8. **wiki with product information/general advice** - Like how to identify what hair type you have/examples of face shapes so you can see what your face shape is.\n\nIf I've forgotten anyone's suggestion, please reply and remind me. There were a lot, but I think that was 90% of the basic ideas.\n****\n**EDIT 6: /u/mitchells00 has some GREAT suggestions for the subreddit.**\n\n>**1. Flairs:** \"Style Advice\", \"Technique\", \"Products\", \"Inspiration\", whatever; mostly to enforce different post standards for different things.\n \n>**2. Style Advice posts:** text posts only, contains at least one recent picture of yourself. No sappy life stories, and if their questions are overarching \"what can I do to be more attractive\" style questions, then by all means let people also comment about weight/gym in addition to hair.\n \n>**3. Face blurring** needs to be only within the polygon between the corners of your eyes and the corners of your lips; the shape of your head is too important.\n \n>**4. No direct link posts to pictures/albums of random models.** These pictures should accompany a Style Advice post or be shared in a weekly \"Identify this hair style\" and/or \"Inspiration\" post, whatever.\n \n>To make any changes, you need to pull the rug out from underneath everyone and force the content into the megatheads.\n \n>Now, in terms of quality of comments? The border between being blunt and being a dick is pretty clear cut; negative feedback with no clear way on how to help make it better is just an insult, but if there's some sort of advice then I'd say leave it unless it's particularly nasty. There's no better way to destroy a community by forcing everyone to be nice when being asked for advice; just make them not be dicks.",

Having a blanket rule to \"keep it about the hair\" and then a corollary to \"don't make it about the *model*, just their hairstyle\" would do wonders.\n\n>Be relentless and mod with an iron fist.\n\nI did for a while.

I had always been of the opinion that the readers here hated when companies got too soapboxy. It's been a horrendous balancing act for creating policy that allows good, hardworking vendors to contribute content and get their company page views in return, without letting them run rampant. I had never thought to let them do AMAs. What should the content of company-based AMAs look like? What should/should not be allowed?\n\n>stylists or even models or youtubers\n\nGreat ideas there. **I'd frankly just love some stylists on the mod team**, to start with. Suggestions for models and youtubers that you think would be good to have around are welcome.\n\n>Your problem is that hair care isn't really a hobby for people (whereas fashion is).\n\nThat's extremely insightful and explains a lot of the difference between MHA and MFA.\n\n>it's much more important to cultivate a small number of talented people, because a hard core of consistently good contributors can make a massive difference for the quality of the sub - especially as it grows bigger.\n\nI agree. The mods have always maintained that stance. We've never been interested in pleasing the masses -- gosh, you should see the hate mail we get from some of the folks we ban -- it's just overwhelming how much shit we have to sift through every day. I really need to write a bot.\n\n**QUICK EDIT: I'm going to sleep now. I'll check in again tomorrow. Probably something like 8-14 hours from now, depending on how my day goes.

Lose the weight, go to the gym, hope you don't have an ugly face and practice your interpersonal communication skills with strangers. That's the cold, hard truth, and it's [something I too have had to learn the hard way](https://m.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/380yc5/m2359_240_175_65_6_months_holy_shit_it_makes_a/). I'm even blessed with the receding hairline of a guy in his late 40s at 23, and it's gotten worse; you know what any advice for me should be? Shave it off and accept that you're bald.  \n\nYou know what their actual question is? \"How can I be more attractive\". So many of the posts are people who come here seeking some sort of magic bullet that will make them sexy like the people in their pictures, and with shitposts like that come snarky replies.  \n\nIf people are serious about looking for advice, they will post a picture of themselves and maybe accompany it with pictures of models; anything else should be deleted.",

Stuff like \"hey how do I get my hair to be like this?\"\n\n> Your problem is that hair care isn't really a hobby for people (whereas fashion is).\n\nYou're right.

It was difficult and lengthy and didn't really make a difference other than to make the sub look super dead.\n\n\n",

I'm honoured <3\n\nWhile I don't have any experience managing a subreddit/forum/community, I would still like to give my two cents here.  In all the (what I would consider) successful subreddits that I've visited, they all have a few things in common: transparency in their moderation, strict enforcement of the rules, and community participation threads.  In regards to the second point, while the rules should definitely be strictly enforced, there should still be room for fun.  Let people joke and be silly, but don't let that take over the subreddit.  A good example is American Crew Fiber: people joke about how much it is recommended here, and that is fine.  But when posts are being made with the sole purpose of pointing that out (as in, and maybe this has already happened, an image post of the product with a title mocking how popular it is here, such as \"DAE use this\"), that's a little too far.  It's a fine line to walk sometimes, but when in doubt leave it be I suppose.\n\nThe last point basically just means those weekly/daily threads, but they really do help - they segregate the offhand, but still relevant, posts that typically take the attention away from the subreddit's main focus.  Take /r/gamedev, for example.  Screenshots would typically be the highest rated posts if they weren't sanctioned to a single weekly thread, and, while still relevant to the subreddit, would distract from the main subject.\n\nAnother big thing is to have all moderators on the same page.  I don't know what goes on behind the scenes here or in any other subreddit, but everyone should know their responsibilities and the scope of those responsibilities.  As in, not only what the rules are, but *why* they are enforcing those rules.  Like any law, treaty, or pact, the rules only serve as guidelines; there is always a prefacing section that explains the purpose of the document and influences its interpretation.  Again, I don't know how you guys work, and maybe this is already understood, but just my 2\u00a2.\n\n**In summary,** what I believe could really help is:\n\n* Transparency between moderators and users\n* Stricter rules, but don't take all of the fun away\n* Daily/weekly threads to sort out the relevant but dominating posts\n* A thorough understanding between the moderators and their goal for this subreddit\n\nIf I didn't have to get ready for work I could've written a novel here.  I have a few ideas on how this subreddit might get back on its feet and I'd gladly share it with you guys.  If you're willing to listen, just shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you when I have time later today.  I really do want this place to be great, despite how little I visit.\n\nPS I didn't proofread please forgive me",

The moderation team has attempted several times before to \"fix\" MHA and have had no luck at all, which we attribute to the majority of the users at the time just plain not caring. You have caused a discussion large enough to actually do some good, and I am very grateful for that.\n\nSo regarding your points:\n\n>**transparency in their moderation**\n\nI actually drafted a new set of rules almost a year ago, finished it up in about a week, and posted a sticky asking for comments on it. I was critiqued for it being in a google doc, given no actual input on it, and what posts we *did* get, numbered in the single digits. [Here are the proposed updated rules and moderation guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit)\n\n>**strict enforcement of the rules**\n\nYeah, I know... :/ We try, we really do. There's just a LOT of bigotry, shitposting, and vitriol for a subreddit so seemingly innocuous. It's very hard to be everywhere at once, so we definitely need to revisit the current systems we have in place and refine them. Right now, I think many of us are guilty of letting automoderator remove posts at 5 reports...Definitely not an admirable system. I feel bad about it, but it's really just due to the gradual apathy that has set in. It's hard to be passionate and pull our weight when all our prior attempts at straightening this shitshow out have been met with apathy from the userbase. Hopefully, this thread will change that and provide a springboard for a rejuvenated MHA.\n\n>**community participation threads**  \n>The last point basically just means those weekly/daily threads, but they really do help - they segregate the offhand, but still relevant, posts that typically take the attention away from the subreddit's main focus.\n\nYeah man, we DID that. /u/captaincannibal set up AutoModerator bot to generate them daily/weekly, sticky them, distinguish them, all that jazz. We had a schedule in the sidebar and everything. We got an average of 1-2 posts in each one, so I guess he turned it off since it seemed like no one cared. Maybe that's our fault for not enforcing their usage better. Maybe that's on the community. I don't know. We all loved the idea and the hard work that capcan put into it all, but it just didn't work last time. Maybe we should reinstate that and see how it goes this time.\n\n>If I didn't have to get ready for work I could've written a novel here. **I have a few ideas on how this subreddit might get back on its feet** and I'd gladly share it with you guys. If you're willing to listen, just shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you when I have time later today.\n\nYes yes yes, please PM me/us when you are free. We're listening.",

I wasn't around for that, but was it a silent change, or was it a big deal?  I feel like more involvement with the community could help put things in motion.  For example, requesting feedback from the users in a stickied thread (not in this thread, god no.  Something more positive haha).  The users who frequent this sub know what they want the most, but at the same time their feedback should be taken with a grain of salt - not treated as gospel, but definitely taken into consideration.\n\nAn announcement should be made as well.  In order to pull off a change of this magnitude requires *a lot* of attention.  This should be big news.  You are trying to influence the readers themselves, after all.  If nobody knows what you're trying to accomplish then the willing won't be able help.\n\nWith that comes the implication that sudden changes may not be the best route.  Such a big change can't be made overnight.\n\nGive the users time to put in their feedback.  Give *yourselves* time to discuss possible changes.  Ensure that the choices you make are the correct ones.  Make sure that the entire mod team is involved in this process and everybody is on board.\n\nOnce that is all said and done, give a little warning before putting things into effect.  I think the best bet would be to announce the changes on a Friday to be put in effect on the following Monday.  This allows the post to be seen by the influx of weekend users and eases them into the new rules, as well as not putting the moderators through the stress of dealing with the mass of unassuming users.  When Monday comes around and the traffic dies down a bit, any regular users should be aware of the changes coming and the moderator's load should be lightened a bit, and when the next weekend arrives the community is potentially in a much better place in terms of visitors' expectations derived from the content.\n\nOn the topic of announcements and stickies, one critique that I have is delivery of the team's message.  The only example I have is [the current sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3y5fw1/reminder_this_is_rmalehairadvice/).  While I 100% wholeheartedly agree with the message in every way, I feel the delivery could've been a little more professional.  The culture of the sub will reflect the actions - and reactions - of the moderating team.  Nothing personal of course.\n\nI don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but perhaps you should examine the current mod team as well: is everybody pulling their weight?  Are some people not very involved?  If the workload is too much, and certain mods aren't doing their job so to speak, then maybe a restructuring of the team is in order.  Cull the \"dead-weights\" and bring on some new members.  I'm sure there are a handful of very active and trusted users on here that would be happy to help you out if this is the case.\n\nFurthermore, ensure that everyone knows that being a moderator is more than just being an enforcer of the rules.  At least, *here* it shouldn't be,  because that seems to be an ingredient to the success of every great community on reddit.  Again, involvement in the community is key here.  The moderators run the community and that should be used to your advantage.  Use your power to the community's advantage.  Make your presence known - not through force, but through cultivation.  For example, instead of AutoMod posting weekly threads, the mods themselves could be the ones posting it.  \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I have is to not give up.  In the weeks to come, your actions will define the entire subreddit.  I hope you take my advice into consideration.  I really do want to see this place become great.\n\n/u/nathanpaulyoung just name dropping so you see this as well :)\n\nPS I never proof read.",

We did it all exactly as you described.\n\nAnd as far as the mod team pulling their weight, we've all done our own parts throughout the time we've tried to improve the sub.

One of our guys made up some weekly thread ideas, I came up with some new rules, created a discord chat server, etc etc. We posted threads about them asking for feedback and comments. We even implemented some of it. No one cared. No one even noticed. The special topical weekly threads got on average 1 reply each. The post asking for input on the new rules was criticized for linking to a google doc and got like 7 comments total.\n\n\n\nI was a mod for some of that time, and that was exactly why I quit.\n\nWe were doing all that shit and we still had these stupid fucking trolls coming in here talking about how the mods were \"just sitting in their positions to flaunt them\" or some inane shit. \n\nYeah.

Sure, we have a few hairdressers, but most people here I would argue are the type to get one type of haircut and stick with it for years and years. There's relatively little room for experimentation when it comes to haircuts, as it is a long-term investment (usually). You can't cut your hair, so \"oh I don't like this\" and go back - you've cut it, you must now wait.\n\nTo emphasize the issue with lack of expertise, I doubt people here read very much about what's happening in haircutting, or know why you'd cut hair this and that way, or the kinds of hairs that exist. The name for this subreddit is similar to MFA, but I would argue that its content should be closer in similarity to /r/wicked_edge. There they have reviews, discussions about the types of razors and blades use, their pros and cons, etc... We're not talking about hair dyes or razors here (though there is some discussion with fixants). So the people here for the most part know very little about hair care and products (other than the oft repeated advice) and they do not experiment very much, either from lack of desire or the impossibility to experiment. \n\nAs such you wind up with a community of people who just say the same shit all the time and nothing really substantial is discussed or explored. The only way really to remedy that would be if more articles and review-type submissions happened here but I can't think of a way to help that grow organically. \n\nanyway those are my thoughts idk wtv .-.",

                    "body": "The problem woth this sub compared to, say, r/malefashionadvice is that people do not frequently change their hairstyles day to day, and thus it is difficult to establish a decent group of subscribers who will come here regularly seeking (and providing) advice. Once people find a style they like and know how to achieve it, they're done, at least until their hair grows out again, at which point most of us get it cut to the desired length again and repeat the same style, sometimes going years with little to no variation. My guess is that many of the subs here, like myself, are interested in the discussion about hair styling advice, but have little to no experience with doing anything of the sort outside of their own hair. That's why we get the classic trio of responses: American Crew Fiber, Show this to your barber, and Be good looking. But hey, at least recommending everyone get an undercut seems to have fallen out of style!\n\nDo we even have a set of identified hairstylists subscribed here? I'd love to get some advice on what I should do to best complement my facial structure, color, thickness, etc., but as far as I can tell, the best advice I'd receive is a personal anecdote from some stranger as to what he does with his own hair without even knowing what he looks like compared to me. And I can't complain, because that's all I could provide too. \n\nWeekly topics and discussions sound like a nice idea. Honestly, I've been subbed here since 2012 and had no idea that ever took place, but tbh I exclusively reddit on AlienBlue and rarely enter subreddits manually rather than from my feed, which means I usually miss out on stickied posts. If we saw more things along the lines of \"what are the differences between blowdrying and air drying?\" \"Matte vs pomade vs wax; a comparison of terminology and results\" \"best time of day to shower to achieve desired result for work/play\" etc. I think we could see more input than \"how do I achieve x? Answer. Kthx see you in 10 years.\" I get that this is user-driven stuff and don't fault the mods for this, but the fact of the matter is hair styling for most of us is more of a \"do the same shit every day\" kind of thing than a \"hmm, what should I do today\" kind of endeavor, so getting regular visitors is tricky. \n\nAlso, I don't care what the sub is for, if someone posts an almost laughably attractive shirtless model and asks how to look like that, you're going to have to expect some jokes.

Then we could set it to remove non-flaired posts after they're non-flaired for a period of time (I think).\n\n> 4. No direct link posts to pictures/albums of random models.

I would like to contribute but most posters don't give enough information to give a meaningful answer. \n\n\nAn obvious example of this is when guys will post of picture they found on the internet and say \"what products do I need to get this look.\" The problem is different products are used on different textures to achieve the same look.\n\nThe second problem is people just posting saying \"how do I get this haircut?\" It's pretty clear the best answer is to take the picture in and show it to your barber. \n\n\nAnother frustrating issue is people asking what haircut works best on them and blurring their face out. Without being about to see your face shape, it's doubtful you're going to get an accurate answer. \n\nThere are other issues too, but these are some that just come off the top of my head. ",

She routinely told me I looked \"like a welfare child\" and refused to let me go out like that. So yeah, I get you. Bluntness in the context of a family or small community can be fine if there's a mutual understanding.\n\nThe problem is when people are from different traditions or parts of the world, and do not communicate that way. Misunderstanding occur, feelings get hurt, arguments break out between the two parties or defenders of one side or another, and the whole communication breaks down. Because of that, having \"kindness requirements\" has been our disposition toward the matter, and we believe forbidding certain kinds of speech is the easiest way to accomplish that.\n\nCheck out our [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit) for the now-almost-a-year-old proposed rules and moderation changes that no one every cared about.

The problem here is also that everyone endorses the same haircut for every single person. It's always \"short sides long top\" no matter how their headshape, hairline etc is. And not everybody even wants that, the undercut is the most basic haircut of the 2010s, coming here for advice and then be given the same haircut everybody else has isn't exactly good advice, it's a nobrainer. And it also bothers me that everyone is so obsessed with mainstream trends (not trying to sound hipster) and that the \"THIS IS THE NEXT MEME HAIRCUT 2016\" gets up votes.

I feel the problem with alot of posts asking for help are something long the lines of \"What hairstyle should i get\" without even trying to give us something to work with. No pictures of hairstyles he is interested in, no info about his hair type and sometime they dont even give us a picture to work with.\n\nWe here that try to help cant read minds. You guys that ask for help need to put a bit more effort into your posts to give us something to work with.",

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

Throughout the week it \"normalizes\" I guess; I just suck it up for the first day.  That being said I use Head & Shoulders haha.  When I run out of that (soon) I'll be looking into different shampoos and conditioners.\n\nSo, if you wash and condition every day, try to cut back.  If you don't, check out some other shampoos and conditioners.  I'm assuming one that emphasizes hydration or something similar will help with the fluffiness.  If none of those work you could look into some serums or similar products to put into your hair after your shower.  Sorry, I don't really have a lot of experience with different types of products :\\  I'm hoping to try some out soon though.",

This sub should literally never be about the person wearing the hear beyond face shape and features for selecting the best haircut. Comments like \"Step 1: Be attractive/have good genes\" or slurs related to gender identity, sexual orientation, or fat shaming are my least fucking favorite things in the world. Having a blanket rule to \"keep it about the hair\" and then a corollary to \"don't make it about the *model*, just their hairstyle\" would do wonders.\n\n>Be relentless and mod with an iron fist.\n\nI did for a while.

I had always been of the opinion that the readers here hated when companies got too soapboxy. It's been a horrendous balancing act for creating policy that allows good, hardworking vendors to contribute content and get their company page views in return, without letting them run rampant. I had never thought to let them do AMAs. What should the content of company-based AMAs look like? What should/should not be allowed?\n\n>stylists or even models or youtubers\n\nGreat ideas there. **I'd frankly just love some stylists on the mod team**, to start with. Suggestions for models and youtubers that you think would be good to have around are welcome.\n\n>Your problem is that hair care isn't really a hobby for people (whereas fashion is).\n\nThat's extremely insightful and explains a lot of the difference between MHA and MFA.\n\n>it's much more important to cultivate a small number of talented people, because a hard core of consistently good contributors can make a massive difference for the quality of the sub - especially as it grows bigger.\n\nI agree. The mods have always maintained that stance. We've never been interested in pleasing the masses -- gosh, you should see the hate mail we get from some of the folks we ban -- it's just overwhelming how much shit we have to sift through every day. I really need to write a bot.\n\n**QUICK EDIT: I'm going to sleep now. I'll check in again tomorrow. Probably something like 8-14 hours from now, depending on how my day goes.

Stuff like \"hey how do I get my hair to be like this?\"\n\n> Your problem is that hair care isn't really a hobby for people (whereas fashion is).\n\nYou're right.

            "body": "Wow, I'm genuinely surprised that my post has picked up enough traction to have a mod sticky it.  I'm honoured <3\n\nWhile I don't have any experience managing a subreddit/forum/community, I would still like to give my two cents here.  In all the (what I would consider) successful subreddits that I've visited, they all have a few things in common: transparency in their moderation, strict enforcement of the rules, and community participation threads.  In regards to the second point, while the rules should definitely be strictly enforced, there should still be room for fun.  Let people joke and be silly, but don't let that take over the subreddit.  A good example is American Crew Fiber: people joke about how much it is recommended here, and that is fine.  But when posts are being made with the sole purpose of pointing that out (as in, and maybe this has already happened, an image post of the product with a title mocking how popular it is here, such as \"DAE use this\"), that's a little too far.  It's a fine line to walk sometimes, but when in doubt leave it be I suppose.\n\nThe last point basically just means those weekly/daily threads, but they really do help - they segregate the offhand, but still relevant, posts that typically take the attention away from the subreddit's main focus.  Take /r/gamedev, for example.  Screenshots would typically be the highest rated posts if they weren't sanctioned to a single weekly thread, and, while still relevant to the subreddit, would distract from the main subject.\n\nAnother big thing is to have all moderators on the same page.  I don't know what goes on behind the scenes here or in any other subreddit, but everyone should know their responsibilities and the scope of those responsibilities.  As in, not only what the rules are, but *why* they are enforcing those rules.  Like any law, treaty, or pact, the rules only serve as guidelines; there is always a prefacing section that explains the purpose of the document and influences its interpretation.  Again, I don't know how you guys work, and maybe this is already understood, but just my 2\u00a2.\n\n**In summary,** what I believe could really help is:\n\n* Transparency between moderators and users\n* Stricter rules, but don't take all of the fun away\n* Daily/weekly threads to sort out the relevant but dominating posts\n* A thorough understanding between the moderators and their goal for this subreddit\n\nIf I didn't have to get ready for work I could've written a novel here.  I have a few ideas on how this subreddit might get back on its feet and I'd gladly share it with you guys.  If you're willing to listen, just shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you when I have time later today.  I really do want this place to be great, despite how little I visit.\n\nPS I didn't proofread please forgive me",

The moderation team has attempted several times before to \"fix\" MHA and have had no luck at all, which we attribute to the majority of the users at the time just plain not caring. You have caused a discussion large enough to actually do some good, and I am very grateful for that.\n\nSo regarding your points:\n\n>**transparency in their moderation**\n\nI actually drafted a new set of rules almost a year ago, finished it up in about a week, and posted a sticky asking for comments on it. I was critiqued for it being in a google doc, given no actual input on it, and what posts we *did* get, numbered in the single digits. [Here are the proposed updated rules and moderation guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit)\n\n>**strict enforcement of the rules**\n\nYeah, I know... :/ We try, we really do. There's just a LOT of bigotry, shitposting, and vitriol for a subreddit so seemingly innocuous. It's very hard to be everywhere at once, so we definitely need to revisit the current systems we have in place and refine them. Right now, I think many of us are guilty of letting automoderator remove posts at 5 reports...Definitely not an admirable system. I feel bad about it, but it's really just due to the gradual apathy that has set in. It's hard to be passionate and pull our weight when all our prior attempts at straightening this shitshow out have been met with apathy from the userbase. Hopefully, this thread will change that and provide a springboard for a rejuvenated MHA.\n\n>**community participation threads**  \n>The last point basically just means those weekly/daily threads, but they really do help - they segregate the offhand, but still relevant, posts that typically take the attention away from the subreddit's main focus.\n\nYeah man, we DID that. /u/captaincannibal set up AutoModerator bot to generate them daily/weekly, sticky them, distinguish them, all that jazz. We had a schedule in the sidebar and everything. We got an average of 1-2 posts in each one, so I guess he turned it off since it seemed like no one cared. Maybe that's our fault for not enforcing their usage better. Maybe that's on the community. I don't know. We all loved the idea and the hard work that capcan put into it all, but it just didn't work last time. Maybe we should reinstate that and see how it goes this time.\n\n>If I didn't have to get ready for work I could've written a novel here. **I have a few ideas on how this subreddit might get back on its feet** and I'd gladly share it with you guys. If you're willing to listen, just shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you when I have time later today.\n\nYes yes yes, please PM me/us when you are free. We're listening.",

                                    "body": "A common theme I am seeing here is that previous attempts have failed.  I wasn't around for that, but was it a silent change, or was it a big deal?  I feel like more involvement with the community could help put things in motion.  For example, requesting feedback from the users in a stickied thread (not in this thread, god no.  Something more positive haha).  The users who frequent this sub know what they want the most, but at the same time their feedback should be taken with a grain of salt - not treated as gospel, but definitely taken into consideration.\n\nAn announcement should be made as well.  In order to pull off a change of this magnitude requires *a lot* of attention.  This should be big news.  You are trying to influence the readers themselves, after all.  If nobody knows what you're trying to accomplish then the willing won't be able help.\n\nWith that comes the implication that sudden changes may not be the best route.  Such a big change can't be made overnight.\n\nGive the users time to put in their feedback.  Give *yourselves* time to discuss possible changes.  Ensure that the choices you make are the correct ones.  Make sure that the entire mod team is involved in this process and everybody is on board.\n\nOnce that is all said and done, give a little warning before putting things into effect.  I think the best bet would be to announce the changes on a Friday to be put in effect on the following Monday.  This allows the post to be seen by the influx of weekend users and eases them into the new rules, as well as not putting the moderators through the stress of dealing with the mass of unassuming users.  When Monday comes around and the traffic dies down a bit, any regular users should be aware of the changes coming and the moderator's load should be lightened a bit, and when the next weekend arrives the community is potentially in a much better place in terms of visitors' expectations derived from the content.\n\nOn the topic of announcements and stickies, one critique that I have is delivery of the team's message.  The only example I have is [the current sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3y5fw1/reminder_this_is_rmalehairadvice/).  While I 100% wholeheartedly agree with the message in every way, I feel the delivery could've been a little more professional.  The culture of the sub will reflect the actions - and reactions - of the moderating team.  Nothing personal of course.\n\nI don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but perhaps you should examine the current mod team as well: is everybody pulling their weight?  Are some people not very involved?  If the workload is too much, and certain mods aren't doing their job so to speak, then maybe a restructuring of the team is in order.  Cull the \"dead-weights\" and bring on some new members.  I'm sure there are a handful of very active and trusted users on here that would be happy to help you out if this is the case.\n\nFurthermore, ensure that everyone knows that being a moderator is more than just being an enforcer of the rules.  At least, *here* it shouldn't be,  because that seems to be an ingredient to the success of every great community on reddit.  Again, involvement in the community is key here.  The moderators run the community and that should be used to your advantage.  Use your power to the community's advantage.  Make your presence known - not through force, but through cultivation.  For example, instead of AutoMod posting weekly threads, the mods themselves could be the ones posting it.  \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I have is to not give up.  In the weeks to come, your actions will define the entire subreddit.  I hope you take my advice into consideration.  I really do want to see this place become great.\n\n/u/nathanpaulyoung just name dropping so you see this as well :)\n\nPS I never proof read.",

We even implemented some of it. No one cared. No one even noticed. The special topical weekly threads got on average 1 reply each. The post asking for input on the new rules was criticized for linking to a google doc and got like 7 comments total.\n\n\n\nI was a mod for some of that time, and that was exactly why I quit.\n\nWe were doing all that shit and we still had these stupid fucking trolls coming in here talking about how the mods were \"just sitting in their positions to flaunt them\" or some inane shit. \n\nYeah. Because working what amounts to a 2nd part-time job for free is SO prestigious and worth bragging about. \n\nSorry I bailed on you guys.

Sure, we have a few hairdressers, but most people here I would argue are the type to get one type of haircut and stick with it for years and years. There's relatively little room for experimentation when it comes to haircuts, as it is a long-term investment (usually). You can't cut your hair, so \"oh I don't like this\" and go back - you've cut it, you must now wait.\n\nTo emphasize the issue with lack of expertise, I doubt people here read very much about what's happening in haircutting, or know why you'd cut hair this and that way, or the kinds of hairs that exist. The name for this subreddit is similar to MFA, but I would argue that its content should be closer in similarity to /r/wicked_edge. There they have reviews, discussions about the types of razors and blades use, their pros and cons, etc... We're not talking about hair dyes or razors here (though there is some discussion with fixants). So the people here for the most part know very little about hair care and products (other than the oft repeated advice) and they do not experiment very much, either from lack of desire or the impossibility to experiment. \n\nAs such you wind up with a community of people who just say the same shit all the time and nothing really substantial is discussed or explored. The only way really to remedy that would be if more articles and review-type submissions happened here but I can't think of a way to help that grow organically. \n\nanyway those are my thoughts idk wtv .-.",

            "body": "The problem woth this sub compared to, say, r/malefashionadvice is that people do not frequently change their hairstyles day to day, and thus it is difficult to establish a decent group of subscribers who will come here regularly seeking (and providing) advice. Once people find a style they like and know how to achieve it, they're done, at least until their hair grows out again, at which point most of us get it cut to the desired length again and repeat the same style, sometimes going years with little to no variation. My guess is that many of the subs here, like myself, are interested in the discussion about hair styling advice, but have little to no experience with doing anything of the sort outside of their own hair. That's why we get the classic trio of responses: American Crew Fiber, Show this to your barber, and Be good looking. But hey, at least recommending everyone get an undercut seems to have fallen out of style!\n\nDo we even have a set of identified hairstylists subscribed here? I'd love to get some advice on what I should do to best complement my facial structure, color, thickness, etc., but as far as I can tell, the best advice I'd receive is a personal anecdote from some stranger as to what he does with his own hair without even knowing what he looks like compared to me. And I can't complain, because that's all I could provide too. \n\nWeekly topics and discussions sound like a nice idea. Honestly, I've been subbed here since 2012 and had no idea that ever took place, but tbh I exclusively reddit on AlienBlue and rarely enter subreddits manually rather than from my feed, which means I usually miss out on stickied posts. If we saw more things along the lines of \"what are the differences between blowdrying and air drying?\" \"Matte vs pomade vs wax; a comparison of terminology and results\" \"best time of day to shower to achieve desired result for work/play\" etc. I think we could see more input than \"how do I achieve x? Answer. Kthx see you in 10 years.\" I get that this is user-driven stuff and don't fault the mods for this, but the fact of the matter is hair styling for most of us is more of a \"do the same shit every day\" kind of thing than a \"hmm, what should I do today\" kind of endeavor, so getting regular visitors is tricky. \n\nAlso, I don't care what the sub is for, if someone posts an almost laughably attractive shirtless model and asks how to look like that, you're going to have to expect some jokes.

Bluntness in the context of a family or small community can be fine if there's a mutual understanding.\n\nThe problem is when people are from different traditions or parts of the world, and do not communicate that way. Misunderstanding occur, feelings get hurt, arguments break out between the two parties or defenders of one side or another, and the whole communication breaks down. Because of that, having \"kindness requirements\" has been our disposition toward the matter, and we believe forbidding certain kinds of speech is the easiest way to accomplish that.\n\nCheck out our [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit) for the now-almost-a-year-old proposed rules and moderation changes that no one every cared about.

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

When I run out of that (soon) I'll be looking into different shampoos and conditioners.\n\nSo, if you wash and condition every day, try to cut back.  If you don't, check out some other shampoos and conditioners.  I'm assuming one that emphasizes hydration or something similar will help with the fluffiness.  If none of those work you could look into some serums or similar products to put into your hair after your shower.  Sorry, I don't really have a lot of experience with different types of products :\\  I'm hoping to try some out soon though.",

I had always been of the opinion that the readers here hated when companies got too soapboxy. It's been a horrendous balancing act for creating policy that allows good, hardworking vendors to contribute content and get their company page views in return, without letting them run rampant. I had never thought to let them do AMAs. What should the content of company-based AMAs look like? What should/should not be allowed?\n\n>stylists or even models or youtubers\n\nGreat ideas there. **I'd frankly just love some stylists on the mod team**, to start with. Suggestions for models and youtubers that you think would be good to have around are welcome.\n\n>Your problem is that hair care isn't really a hobby for people (whereas fashion is).\n\nThat's extremely insightful and explains a lot of the difference between MHA and MFA.\n\n>it's much more important to cultivate a small number of talented people, because a hard core of consistently good contributors can make a massive difference for the quality of the sub - especially as it grows bigger.\n\nI agree. The mods have always maintained that stance. We've never been interested in pleasing the masses -- gosh, you should see the hate mail we get from some of the folks we ban -- it's just overwhelming how much shit we have to sift through every day. I really need to write a bot.\n\n**QUICK EDIT: I'm going to sleep now. I'll check in again tomorrow. Probably something like 8-14 hours from now, depending on how my day goes.

The moderation team has attempted several times before to \"fix\" MHA and have had no luck at all, which we attribute to the majority of the users at the time just plain not caring. You have caused a discussion large enough to actually do some good, and I am very grateful for that.\n\nSo regarding your points:\n\n>**transparency in their moderation**\n\nI actually drafted a new set of rules almost a year ago, finished it up in about a week, and posted a sticky asking for comments on it. I was critiqued for it being in a google doc, given no actual input on it, and what posts we *did* get, numbered in the single digits. [Here are the proposed updated rules and moderation guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit)\n\n>**strict enforcement of the rules**\n\nYeah, I know... :/ We try, we really do. There's just a LOT of bigotry, shitposting, and vitriol for a subreddit so seemingly innocuous. It's very hard to be everywhere at once, so we definitely need to revisit the current systems we have in place and refine them. Right now, I think many of us are guilty of letting automoderator remove posts at 5 reports...Definitely not an admirable system. I feel bad about it, but it's really just due to the gradual apathy that has set in. It's hard to be passionate and pull our weight when all our prior attempts at straightening this shitshow out have been met with apathy from the userbase. Hopefully, this thread will change that and provide a springboard for a rejuvenated MHA.\n\n>**community participation threads**  \n>The last point basically just means those weekly/daily threads, but they really do help - they segregate the offhand, but still relevant, posts that typically take the attention away from the subreddit's main focus.\n\nYeah man, we DID that. /u/captaincannibal set up AutoModerator bot to generate them daily/weekly, sticky them, distinguish them, all that jazz. We had a schedule in the sidebar and everything. We got an average of 1-2 posts in each one, so I guess he turned it off since it seemed like no one cared. Maybe that's our fault for not enforcing their usage better. Maybe that's on the community. I don't know. We all loved the idea and the hard work that capcan put into it all, but it just didn't work last time. Maybe we should reinstate that and see how it goes this time.\n\n>If I didn't have to get ready for work I could've written a novel here. **I have a few ideas on how this subreddit might get back on its feet** and I'd gladly share it with you guys. If you're willing to listen, just shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you when I have time later today.\n\nYes yes yes, please PM me/us when you are free. We're listening.",

                        {
                            "body": "A common theme I am seeing here is that previous attempts have failed.  I wasn't around for that, but was it a silent change, or was it a big deal?  I feel like more involvement with the community could help put things in motion.  For example, requesting feedback from the users in a stickied thread (not in this thread, god no.  Something more positive haha).  The users who frequent this sub know what they want the most, but at the same time their feedback should be taken with a grain of salt - not treated as gospel, but definitely taken into consideration.\n\nAn announcement should be made as well.  In order to pull off a change of this magnitude requires *a lot* of attention.  This should be big news.  You are trying to influence the readers themselves, after all.  If nobody knows what you're trying to accomplish then the willing won't be able help.\n\nWith that comes the implication that sudden changes may not be the best route.  Such a big change can't be made overnight.\n\nGive the users time to put in their feedback.  Give *yourselves* time to discuss possible changes.  Ensure that the choices you make are the correct ones.  Make sure that the entire mod team is involved in this process and everybody is on board.\n\nOnce that is all said and done, give a little warning before putting things into effect.  I think the best bet would be to announce the changes on a Friday to be put in effect on the following Monday.  This allows the post to be seen by the influx of weekend users and eases them into the new rules, as well as not putting the moderators through the stress of dealing with the mass of unassuming users.  When Monday comes around and the traffic dies down a bit, any regular users should be aware of the changes coming and the moderator's load should be lightened a bit, and when the next weekend arrives the community is potentially in a much better place in terms of visitors' expectations derived from the content.\n\nOn the topic of announcements and stickies, one critique that I have is delivery of the team's message.  The only example I have is [the current sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3y5fw1/reminder_this_is_rmalehairadvice/).  While I 100% wholeheartedly agree with the message in every way, I feel the delivery could've been a little more professional.  The culture of the sub will reflect the actions - and reactions - of the moderating team.  Nothing personal of course.\n\nI don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but perhaps you should examine the current mod team as well: is everybody pulling their weight?  Are some people not very involved?  If the workload is too much, and certain mods aren't doing their job so to speak, then maybe a restructuring of the team is in order.  Cull the \"dead-weights\" and bring on some new members.  I'm sure there are a handful of very active and trusted users on here that would be happy to help you out if this is the case.\n\nFurthermore, ensure that everyone knows that being a moderator is more than just being an enforcer of the rules.  At least, *here* it shouldn't be,  because that seems to be an ingredient to the success of every great community on reddit.  Again, involvement in the community is key here.  The moderators run the community and that should be used to your advantage.  Use your power to the community's advantage.  Make your presence known - not through force, but through cultivation.  For example, instead of AutoMod posting weekly threads, the mods themselves could be the ones posting it.  \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I have is to not give up.  In the weeks to come, your actions will define the entire subreddit.  I hope you take my advice into consideration.  I really do want to see this place become great.\n\n/u/nathanpaulyoung just name dropping so you see this as well :)\n\nPS I never proof read.",

Bluntness in the context of a family or small community can be fine if there's a mutual understanding.\n\nThe problem is when people are from different traditions or parts of the world, and do not communicate that way. Misunderstanding occur, feelings get hurt, arguments break out between the two parties or defenders of one side or another, and the whole communication breaks down. Because of that, having \"kindness requirements\" has been our disposition toward the matter, and we believe forbidding certain kinds of speech is the easiest way to accomplish that.\n\nCheck out our [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD3QkFPi0gyOALmLp6_yS2Iq74TLslzleNFq5n0k_wo/edit) for the now-almost-a-year-old proposed rules and moderation changes that no one every cared about.

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

When I run out of that (soon) I'll be looking into different shampoos and conditioners.\n\nSo, if you wash and condition every day, try to cut back.  If you don't, check out some other shampoos and conditioners.  I'm assuming one that emphasizes hydration or something similar will help with the fluffiness.  If none of those work you could look into some serums or similar products to put into your hair after your shower.  Sorry, I don't really have a lot of experience with different types of products :\\  I'm hoping to try some out soon though.",

Lose the weight, go to the gym, hope you don't have an ugly face and practice your interpersonal communication skills with strangers. That's the cold, hard truth, and it's [something I too have had to learn the hard way](https://m.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/380yc5/m2359_240_175_65_6_months_holy_shit_it_makes_a/). I'm even blessed with the receding hairline of a guy in his late 40s at 23, and it's gotten worse; you know what any advice for me should be? Shave it off and accept that you're bald.  \n\nYou know what their actual question is? \"How can I be more attractive\". So many of the posts are people who come here seeking some sort of magic bullet that will make them sexy like the people in their pictures, and with shitposts like that come snarky replies.  \n\nIf people are serious about looking for advice, they will post a picture of themselves and maybe accompany it with pictures of models; anything else should be deleted.",

                    "body": "A common theme I am seeing here is that previous attempts have failed.  I wasn't around for that, but was it a silent change, or was it a big deal?  I feel like more involvement with the community could help put things in motion.  For example, requesting feedback from the users in a stickied thread (not in this thread, god no.  Something more positive haha).  The users who frequent this sub know what they want the most, but at the same time their feedback should be taken with a grain of salt - not treated as gospel, but definitely taken into consideration.\n\nAn announcement should be made as well.  In order to pull off a change of this magnitude requires *a lot* of attention.  This should be big news.  You are trying to influence the readers themselves, after all.  If nobody knows what you're trying to accomplish then the willing won't be able help.\n\nWith that comes the implication that sudden changes may not be the best route.  Such a big change can't be made overnight.\n\nGive the users time to put in their feedback.  Give *yourselves* time to discuss possible changes.  Ensure that the choices you make are the correct ones.  Make sure that the entire mod team is involved in this process and everybody is on board.\n\nOnce that is all said and done, give a little warning before putting things into effect.  I think the best bet would be to announce the changes on a Friday to be put in effect on the following Monday.  This allows the post to be seen by the influx of weekend users and eases them into the new rules, as well as not putting the moderators through the stress of dealing with the mass of unassuming users.  When Monday comes around and the traffic dies down a bit, any regular users should be aware of the changes coming and the moderator's load should be lightened a bit, and when the next weekend arrives the community is potentially in a much better place in terms of visitors' expectations derived from the content.\n\nOn the topic of announcements and stickies, one critique that I have is delivery of the team's message.  The only example I have is [the current sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3y5fw1/reminder_this_is_rmalehairadvice/).  While I 100% wholeheartedly agree with the message in every way, I feel the delivery could've been a little more professional.  The culture of the sub will reflect the actions - and reactions - of the moderating team.  Nothing personal of course.\n\nI don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but perhaps you should examine the current mod team as well: is everybody pulling their weight?  Are some people not very involved?  If the workload is too much, and certain mods aren't doing their job so to speak, then maybe a restructuring of the team is in order.  Cull the \"dead-weights\" and bring on some new members.  I'm sure there are a handful of very active and trusted users on here that would be happy to help you out if this is the case.\n\nFurthermore, ensure that everyone knows that being a moderator is more than just being an enforcer of the rules.  At least, *here* it shouldn't be,  because that seems to be an ingredient to the success of every great community on reddit.  Again, involvement in the community is key here.  The moderators run the community and that should be used to your advantage.  Use your power to the community's advantage.  Make your presence known - not through force, but through cultivation.  For example, instead of AutoMod posting weekly threads, the mods themselves could be the ones posting it.  \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I have is to not give up.  In the weeks to come, your actions will define the entire subreddit.  I hope you take my advice into consideration.  I really do want to see this place become great.\n\n/u/nathanpaulyoung just name dropping so you see this as well :)\n\nPS I never proof read.",

Bluntness in the context of a family or small community can be fine if there's a mutual understanding.\n\nThe problem is when people are from different traditions or parts of the world, and do not communicate that way. Misunderstanding occur, feelings get hurt, arguments break out between the two parties or defenders of one side or another, and the whole communication breaks down.

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

When I run out of that (soon) I'll be looking into different shampoos and conditioners.\n\nSo, if you wash and condition every day, try to cut back.  If you don't, check out some other shampoos and conditioners.  I'm assuming one that emphasizes hydration or something similar will help with the fluffiness.  If none of those work you could look into some serums or similar products to put into your hair after your shower.  Sorry, I don't really have a lot of experience with different types of products :\\  I'm hoping to try some out soon though.",

            "body": "A common theme I am seeing here is that previous attempts have failed.  I wasn't around for that, but was it a silent change, or was it a big deal?  I feel like more involvement with the community could help put things in motion.  For example, requesting feedback from the users in a stickied thread (not in this thread, god no.  Something more positive haha).  The users who frequent this sub know what they want the most, but at the same time their feedback should be taken with a grain of salt - not treated as gospel, but definitely taken into consideration.\n\nAn announcement should be made as well.  In order to pull off a change of this magnitude requires *a lot* of attention.  This should be big news.  You are trying to influence the readers themselves, after all.  If nobody knows what you're trying to accomplish then the willing won't be able help.\n\nWith that comes the implication that sudden changes may not be the best route.  Such a big change can't be made overnight.\n\nGive the users time to put in their feedback.  Give *yourselves* time to discuss possible changes.  Ensure that the choices you make are the correct ones.  Make sure that the entire mod team is involved in this process and everybody is on board.\n\nOnce that is all said and done, give a little warning before putting things into effect.  I think the best bet would be to announce the changes on a Friday to be put in effect on the following Monday.  This allows the post to be seen by the influx of weekend users and eases them into the new rules, as well as not putting the moderators through the stress of dealing with the mass of unassuming users.  When Monday comes around and the traffic dies down a bit, any regular users should be aware of the changes coming and the moderator's load should be lightened a bit, and when the next weekend arrives the community is potentially in a much better place in terms of visitors' expectations derived from the content.\n\nOn the topic of announcements and stickies, one critique that I have is delivery of the team's message.  The only example I have is [the current sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3y5fw1/reminder_this_is_rmalehairadvice/).  While I 100% wholeheartedly agree with the message in every way, I feel the delivery could've been a little more professional.  The culture of the sub will reflect the actions - and reactions - of the moderating team.  Nothing personal of course.\n\nI don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but perhaps you should examine the current mod team as well: is everybody pulling their weight?  Are some people not very involved?  If the workload is too much, and certain mods aren't doing their job so to speak, then maybe a restructuring of the team is in order.  Cull the \"dead-weights\" and bring on some new members.  I'm sure there are a handful of very active and trusted users on here that would be happy to help you out if this is the case.\n\nFurthermore, ensure that everyone knows that being a moderator is more than just being an enforcer of the rules.  At least, *here* it shouldn't be,  because that seems to be an ingredient to the success of every great community on reddit.  Again, involvement in the community is key here.  The moderators run the community and that should be used to your advantage.  Use your power to the community's advantage.  Make your presence known - not through force, but through cultivation.  For example, instead of AutoMod posting weekly threads, the mods themselves could be the ones posting it.  \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I have is to not give up.  In the weeks to come, your actions will define the entire subreddit.  I hope you take my advice into consideration.  I really do want to see this place become great.\n\n/u/nathanpaulyoung just name dropping so you see this as well :)\n\nPS I never proof read.",

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

No sappy life stories, and if their questions are overarching \"what can I do to be more attractive\" style questions, then by all means let people also comment about weight/gym in *addition* to hair.  \n&nbsp;  \n3) Face blurring needs to be only within the polygon between the corners of your eyes and the corners of your lips; the shape of your head is too important.  \n&nbsp;  \n4) No direct link posts to pictures/albums of random models. These pictures should accompany a Style Advice post or be shared in a weekly \"Identify this hair style\" and/or \"Inspiration\" post, whatever.  \n&nbsp;  \nTo make any changes, you need to pull the rug out from underneath everyone and force the content into the megatheads.  \n&nbsp;  \nNow, in terms of quality of comments? The border between being blunt and being a dick is pretty clear cut; negative feedback with no clear way on how to help make it better is just an insult, but if there's some sort of advice then I'd say leave it unless it's particularly nasty. There's no better way to destroy a community by forcing everyone to be nice when being asked for advice; just make them not be dicks.",

Low heat setting can also help here. The idea is to evaporate the water which had formerly merged with the product in your hair to form a paste, which will solidify around your hair evenly in whatever shape the hair is. The brush is to lift it and separate the strands as much as possible, the low speed is to keep the blow drying from messing with your style, and the low heat is to prevent the heat itself from melting the product.",

Throughout the week it \"normalizes\" I guess; I just suck it up for the first day.  That being said I use Head & Shoulders haha.  When I run out of that (soon) I'll be looking into different shampoos and conditioners.\n\nSo, if you wash and condition every day, try to cut back.  If you don't, check out some other shampoos and conditioners.  I'm assuming one that emphasizes hydration or something similar will help with the fluffiness.  If none of those work you could look into some serums or similar products to put into your hair after your shower.  Sorry, I don't really have a lot of experience with different types of products :\\  I'm hoping to try some out soon though.",
