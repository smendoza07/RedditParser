They are a small pair of clippers, that you can use yourself to shave out that area tight. That\u2019s what we do in the salon. We create the hairline, where the bottom of your hair falls, and use the trimmers to almost shave it away. They will pay for themselves quickly. You can google them, find them on eBay, Amazon, or here are a few brands that I work with as a last resort. Oster, Wahl, Andis.",

Let your hairline dictate the length of your hair.",
