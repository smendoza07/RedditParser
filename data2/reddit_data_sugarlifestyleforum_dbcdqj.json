    "body": "She is pretty, cute, mom of his child. She\u2019s a researcher and does extremely meaningful work for society, super productive and successful, her track record blew my mind. She also looks outdoorsy and fun. I looked her up and I genuinely admired her and thought I don\u2019t compare. \n\nMy pot has been seeing girls behind her back for 4 years at least. She has no clue. I don\u2019t understand why and how someone would cheat on a woman like that. I just don\u2019t get it. He said he would not change a thing about his life with her and that he loves his family as it is. Why would he be so committed to SA? Why cheat on such women?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m being downvoted left and right and I wanted to say please understand I\u2019m asking out of curiosity. I\u2019m not making any ethical judgment on any lifestyle. I\u2019m part of it myself.\n\nEdit2: Thank you for the insights. I\u2019m getting intimidated by the comments saying I was ill-meaning. I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna move on with my life and I\u2019m not thinking about this, as some suggested. Setting up a date with my pot and I can\u2019t wait to kiss his sweet lips. Take care ya\u2019ll!",

I've always said \"own your decision\". I've never said anything but.\n\n_\"Fucking for money is okay, but only under special, specific circumstances that fit my current sense of morality.\"_\n\nWhat. Ever. People are going to have sex with who they want to have sex with under whatever guise of \"willful blindness\" they choose that fits their sense of morality for the day. \n\nOne thing I know with absolute certainty? If it's not you they're having sex with and paying money for that privilege, it most certainly will be with someone else. Nothing hypocritical about that observation. Think about that the next time you collect your PPM.\n\nWe should all be careful of falling off our high horses. Bones could break.",

They only consider the \u201cmarried\u201d part because it\u2019s a choice someone ELSE made and would in part, through some twisted sense of self, would make her feel \u201cdirty\u201d because he\u2019s married - NOT that she\u2019s fucking for cash.\n\nAnd one step further? I\u2019ve known some SB\u2019s that vehemently avoid fucking married OLDER guys but were more than okay to fuck the HOT young married guy for money cuz, well, his wife is obviously a bitch for not taking his gorgeous \u201cD\u201d for a ride, that poor, young, broken man.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this forum (and in the bowl) long enough to see all sides of the selective morality dance.

Or just incapable of connecting permanently and monogamously. Maybe the whole relationship is open and he just doesn't want to tell you that because people look at him weird when he tells you that.\n\nMake sure you get what you want out of the relationship (money, sex, emotional support, mentoring, etc) and don't focus on the rest too much.

She was a raging, hateful bitch!  Seriously. No one in her life, from the mailman, to her assistant (me), and sadly also to her super sweet, phenomenally successful husband, was beyond the grasp of her wrath.  It was the best paying job, both monetarily and benefits-wise, that I\u2019ve ever had and I high-tailed it out of there in less than 3 months because I have a spine and a mouth, and a snarky attitude at times, and she insisted on testing everyone around her, every day.  She and her husband put on a VERY believable charade, but in reality he\u2019d been diddling his secretary for all of time (hey at least he stuck to the same woman, who was age-appropriate - they were in their late l-70\u2019s lol), were in separate rooms 98% of the time, and only exchanged words via phone and hand-written notes. Granted it was relatively amicable, and I\u2019m sure he had his own faults that contributed to the shit-show.  The thing that I did always appreciate though was that regardless of how things were, they still constantly told one another how much they loved, respected, and appreciated one another.  And it wasn\u2019t for show.  At least it didn\u2019t seem that way.  The son on the other hand - WHEW!  Grumpy thing he was, but completely understandable given the environment. \n\nNot saying that that is definitely, or even likely, the case with your subject here, but its very common.  Some people stay busy and paint a pretty picture on the outside to cover up the inside. Some do it out of insecurity, some because they have a genuine passion for every last thing that they\u2019re involved in (they are highly fortunate, though its not beyond anyone\u2019s grasp!). A LOT do it to be \u201cbetter than,\u201d to keep up with or out-do someone else, or just because they\u2019re bored. \n\nI saw that you stated that you \u201cvetted\u201d him as well. What were/are your resources for doing so?   (I am curious as I have never really gone off of anything aside from my gut feeling, and I can honestly say it hasn\u2019t steered me wrong as of yet). Again, words and photos can paint a hell of a picture, and as a society highly based on aesthetic and status, it is easily bought into.  Unfortunately, more often than not it is all a facade.   I\u2019d say the \u201casshole\u201d scenario is a 50/50 chance. \n\nSorry for the novel :) ive been on here for EVER, and have never commented on anything lol\n\nEDIT:  Forgot to include... you said you thought \u201chow do I compare.\u201d  Don\u2019t be hard on yourself.  You are just as capable of attaining the very same things she has. But remember - he is looking elsewhere because he wants someone/something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  ;)",

What did you find out?\" I went \"here\", opened a fingerprint lock box sitting on the counter, pulled out my compensated and tricked out .45, plopped it on the counter in front of her and said \"strip it.\" \n\nShe smiled wider than I have ever seen a woman smile and proceeded to tear it down with practiced skill.\n\n(no, I didn't have rounds in the magazine. I wasn't stupid.) LMAO!\n\nAnd yes we're still good friends. But the little shit kept my damn pistol. I offered her that or a laptop later as a gift. She chose the pistol.

Imagine your reaction if he looked up your parents/siblings and then asked you about it? \"Oh you have a great dad why do you seemingly have daddy issues, and looks like he's well off to provide for you why do you need to do this for money?\"\n\nAt best it's moral grey area in this whole situation that we all turn a blind eye too, once you get past this and actually look into the situation it makes it all the more real. I'm sure married guys and girls involved with married guys are all shivering at this and things became that much more real rather than this built up fantasy life they're in now.",

He said he would not change a thing about his life with her and that he loves his family as it is. Why would he be so committed to SA? Why cheat on such women?\n\nImagine your favorite food, and then imagine the best version of that food you've ever eaten anywhere.  You love it, right?  You wouldn't change a thing about it.  But that still doesn't stop you from wanting to enjoy other foods too.\n\nThat Whitney Houston song \"I'm Every Woman\" always struck me as a woman deluding herself.  No woman, no matter how great, can be every woman that a man wants.  The desire for a variety of women is always there and it can never be satiated, but it doesn't stop us from wanting to try.\n\nSo I hope that explains why he'd want to cheat on her.  \n\nWhy he'd actually do it is a different thing.  When I've been in monogamous relationships, I've always wanted other women too, but have remained faithful because the thought of the pain it would cause to the woman I cared about if she caught me was not worth the risk.  His assessment of that risk/reward is different than mine and I do judge him for it.  Also, he swore a vow to her, in front of their friends and family, and I judge him for breaking that, too.  Unless they've discussed it and she's ok with him doing this, of course.",

When others say \"no thanks,\" your whole body is electric to keep going. Problem is, if anyone ever found out you eat the way you do, everyone would hate you. You would lose your kids. People would tell you that you make poor dietary choices. But to you, it doesn't affect your family, work, or anything. You can eat and make everyone happy, as long as they don't know. Some days, you wake up, and you really want to be \"normal\". Other days, you wake up, and you look at other people that pass up that good food. Where is their passion? Why do they go on with life when their meals are just tedious? Besides, that rush you get makes you so...different. People find you interesting and fun, because you constantly act hungry.\n#\nSome men chemically can resist sex better than others. Men are told that \"eventually\" they will stop wanting every woman they see. For some men, that's true. For many men, that's bullshit. We want to take care of a family, but a man like that has lust the way that gamblers, substance abusers, and preachers have addictions. It never goes away. Even worse, you can never drink or gamble again. But you can't not ever have sex...\n#\nYou are helping a guy scratch an itch. You make it fun. He wants his real life, but if he tries to do it without sex with other women, I promise, he will become suicidal. I promise, he will be someone different. Sds... when we lose passion... yeah, we die. Of someone said to you, \"yeah, eventually, you will settle down and never laugh at any jokes but the ones your husband tells you.\" How would you feel? \"It's shameful to laugh with someone else!!! How dare you...\" \n#\nHumans make so much of their own misery.",

But the physical is still important, and when you have a good life everywhere else,  it is not enough to make you want to break everything off when that disappears. Being in a dead bedroom situation sucks. It hurts. You go through emotions of feeling rejected and unloved, anger, depression.  You talk with your SO to work things out, you understand where they're coming from, they understand where you're coming from, but nothing changes. It's almost worse when your SO agrees to \"try more\" and physical intimacy feels forced and like they're just letting you use them for your pleasure. It's horrible. Where does that leave you? Leave your life?  No, not an option, like I said, so much invested and your love goes deeper than that physical intimacy. BUT, you still need it.  So what?  If your SO isn't open to letting you release that physical need with her permission, then what?  You have 2 choices, leave everything to get those physical needs met, or go behind her back. You've already decided option 1 isn't an option, so...\nIt's easy to think you're a bad person for wanting that and doing that, and others to judge you as such too.  But it so much more complicated. I don't think anyone who has been through this comes to the decision lightly.  I sure as hell haven't. I would love to meet someone who understands that or a married woman who is in the same situation as me.  Someone who understands that it is for that physical release, but that our lives outside of that are great. Anyway, hope that helps. Peace.",

Why does a guy with such a wonderful wife want to spend time with women like me?\"\n\nYou claim \"she has no clue\". How you know this is beyond me. You claim he is \"committed to SA\" when at best you can determine he regularly enjoys time with an SB. Those are not the same.\n\nHow many times a week do they have sex? How many times a month? How many times a year? \n\nHow often does she tell him how wonderful is? Look at him with the wonder and adoration a close SB might? \n\nHow often does he get to give her the most simple life advice and have her be immediately grateful?\n\n**The answers to these questions in no way diminish how wonderful this woman is. She may well be everything you say --- and much much more.**\n\nHe needs something, however, she doesn't provide him. For all we know she needs something he doesn't provide her.

It's impossible to do that with true pros (I'd imagine; anyone working by the hour is going to offer limited emotional connection) and yet very doable with a good SB.  \n\n\nTSD wrote: \"Men are told that \"eventually\" they will stop wanting every woman they see.\"\n\nI think they are told that. I think it's almost certainly false for men of normal sex drive/libido who are heterosexual.\n\nFinal thoughts: If I had learned a POT SB had done this research and drawn her own conclusions and judgments like this, I would not only never see her again, I would cut off all means of communication.",

We are the only primate to participate in monogamy and there are actually research on why the human body functions in such a non-monogamous way. Monogamy and marriage makes all the sense socially - helps with raising kids, more financially stable, etc - but we are fundamentally unsuited for it, and that's why we always feel so conflicted and miserable: our moral tells us one thing but we want another. \n\n\nThe normal stuff: when I cheat, I don't simply stop loving my partner. A lot of people have problem understanding this. Now there are some people who actually stop loving their partner, or their marriage is already broken, but that's not your question. I cheat because there is a gap that my partner can't fulfill, and I look for it elsewhere: maybe it's sex, understanding, the feeling of being desired, the need to experience something new. Once I got that part fulfilled elsewhere, I came back to my partner for all his other amazing qualities. I think we live in a culture that tells us there will be that one person that fits our every, EVERY needs, but that's not true.\n\nTldr: just because she's amazing doesn't mean he wouldn't cheat.

I've always said \"own your decision\". I've never said anything but.\n\n_\"Fucking for money is okay, but only under special, specific circumstances that fit my current sense of morality.\"_\n\nWhat. Ever. People are going to have sex with who they want to have sex with under whatever guise of \"willful blindness\" they choose that fits their sense of morality for the day. \n\nOne thing I know with absolute certainty? If it's not you they're having sex with and paying money for that privilege, it most certainly will be with someone else. Nothing hypocritical about that observation. Think about that the next time you collect your PPM.\n\nWe should all be careful of falling off our high horses. Bones could break.",

They only consider the \u201cmarried\u201d part because it\u2019s a choice someone ELSE made and would in part, through some twisted sense of self, would make her feel \u201cdirty\u201d because he\u2019s married - NOT that she\u2019s fucking for cash.\n\nAnd one step further? I\u2019ve known some SB\u2019s that vehemently avoid fucking married OLDER guys but were more than okay to fuck the HOT young married guy for money cuz, well, his wife is obviously a bitch for not taking his gorgeous \u201cD\u201d for a ride, that poor, young, broken man.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this forum (and in the bowl) long enough to see all sides of the selective morality dance.

                    "body": "Your description of her very closely mirrors a woman I worked for in the past - crazy successful, beautiful, amazing philanthropist, put on a show about helping children, relatively intelligent, ran in the \u201cright,\u201d highly noticeable and affluent circles, had the \u201cperfect family.\u201d\nHer \u201ccatch\u201d?  She was a raging, hateful bitch!  Seriously. No one in her life, from the mailman, to her assistant (me), and sadly also to her super sweet, phenomenally successful husband, was beyond the grasp of her wrath.  It was the best paying job, both monetarily and benefits-wise, that I\u2019ve ever had and I high-tailed it out of there in less than 3 months because I have a spine and a mouth, and a snarky attitude at times, and she insisted on testing everyone around her, every day.  She and her husband put on a VERY believable charade, but in reality he\u2019d been diddling his secretary for all of time (hey at least he stuck to the same woman, who was age-appropriate - they were in their late l-70\u2019s lol), were in separate rooms 98% of the time, and only exchanged words via phone and hand-written notes. Granted it was relatively amicable, and I\u2019m sure he had his own faults that contributed to the shit-show.  The thing that I did always appreciate though was that regardless of how things were, they still constantly told one another how much they loved, respected, and appreciated one another.  And it wasn\u2019t for show.  At least it didn\u2019t seem that way.  The son on the other hand - WHEW!  Grumpy thing he was, but completely understandable given the environment. \n\nNot saying that that is definitely, or even likely, the case with your subject here, but its very common.  Some people stay busy and paint a pretty picture on the outside to cover up the inside. Some do it out of insecurity, some because they have a genuine passion for every last thing that they\u2019re involved in (they are highly fortunate, though its not beyond anyone\u2019s grasp!). A LOT do it to be \u201cbetter than,\u201d to keep up with or out-do someone else, or just because they\u2019re bored. \n\nI saw that you stated that you \u201cvetted\u201d him as well. What were/are your resources for doing so?   (I am curious as I have never really gone off of anything aside from my gut feeling, and I can honestly say it hasn\u2019t steered me wrong as of yet). Again, words and photos can paint a hell of a picture, and as a society highly based on aesthetic and status, it is easily bought into.  Unfortunately, more often than not it is all a facade.   I\u2019d say the \u201casshole\u201d scenario is a 50/50 chance. \n\nSorry for the novel :) ive been on here for EVER, and have never commented on anything lol\n\nEDIT:  Forgot to include... you said you thought \u201chow do I compare.\u201d  Don\u2019t be hard on yourself.  You are just as capable of attaining the very same things she has. But remember - he is looking elsewhere because he wants someone/something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  ;)",

When I've been in monogamous relationships, I've always wanted other women too, but have remained faithful because the thought of the pain it would cause to the woman I cared about if she caught me was not worth the risk. His assessment of that risk/reward is different than mine and I do judge him for it. Also, he swore a vow to her, in front of their friends and family, and I judge him for breaking that, too. Unless they've discussed it and she's ok with him doing this, of course.\n\nI think this is a pretty reasonable take.

They only consider the \u201cmarried\u201d part because it\u2019s a choice someone ELSE made and would in part, through some twisted sense of self, would make her feel \u201cdirty\u201d because he\u2019s married - NOT that she\u2019s fucking for cash.\n\nAnd one step further? I\u2019ve known some SB\u2019s that vehemently avoid fucking married OLDER guys but were more than okay to fuck the HOT young married guy for money cuz, well, his wife is obviously a bitch for not taking his gorgeous \u201cD\u201d for a ride, that poor, young, broken man.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this forum (and in the bowl) long enough to see all sides of the selective morality dance.

            "body": "Your description of her very closely mirrors a woman I worked for in the past - crazy successful, beautiful, amazing philanthropist, put on a show about helping children, relatively intelligent, ran in the \u201cright,\u201d highly noticeable and affluent circles, had the \u201cperfect family.\u201d\nHer \u201ccatch\u201d?  She was a raging, hateful bitch!  Seriously. No one in her life, from the mailman, to her assistant (me), and sadly also to her super sweet, phenomenally successful husband, was beyond the grasp of her wrath.  It was the best paying job, both monetarily and benefits-wise, that I\u2019ve ever had and I high-tailed it out of there in less than 3 months because I have a spine and a mouth, and a snarky attitude at times, and she insisted on testing everyone around her, every day.  She and her husband put on a VERY believable charade, but in reality he\u2019d been diddling his secretary for all of time (hey at least he stuck to the same woman, who was age-appropriate - they were in their late l-70\u2019s lol), were in separate rooms 98% of the time, and only exchanged words via phone and hand-written notes. Granted it was relatively amicable, and I\u2019m sure he had his own faults that contributed to the shit-show.  The thing that I did always appreciate though was that regardless of how things were, they still constantly told one another how much they loved, respected, and appreciated one another.  And it wasn\u2019t for show.  At least it didn\u2019t seem that way.  The son on the other hand - WHEW!  Grumpy thing he was, but completely understandable given the environment. \n\nNot saying that that is definitely, or even likely, the case with your subject here, but its very common.  Some people stay busy and paint a pretty picture on the outside to cover up the inside. Some do it out of insecurity, some because they have a genuine passion for every last thing that they\u2019re involved in (they are highly fortunate, though its not beyond anyone\u2019s grasp!). A LOT do it to be \u201cbetter than,\u201d to keep up with or out-do someone else, or just because they\u2019re bored. \n\nI saw that you stated that you \u201cvetted\u201d him as well. What were/are your resources for doing so?   (I am curious as I have never really gone off of anything aside from my gut feeling, and I can honestly say it hasn\u2019t steered me wrong as of yet). Again, words and photos can paint a hell of a picture, and as a society highly based on aesthetic and status, it is easily bought into.  Unfortunately, more often than not it is all a facade.   I\u2019d say the \u201casshole\u201d scenario is a 50/50 chance. \n\nSorry for the novel :) ive been on here for EVER, and have never commented on anything lol\n\nEDIT:  Forgot to include... you said you thought \u201chow do I compare.\u201d  Don\u2019t be hard on yourself.  You are just as capable of attaining the very same things she has. But remember - he is looking elsewhere because he wants someone/something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  ;)",

You\u2019re more likely to be cheated on by a surgeon than a mailman, since the mailman most likely can\u2019t afford to be on SA. But you\u2019re more attracted to the surgeon so you make little deals with yourself and turn a blind eye because of his perceived value. It\u2019s been happening since the beginning of time.  Ask yourself if most women would rather be the wife of a Prince who occasionally strays or the wife of a plumber who is faithful. I think you know the answer.",

I\u2019ve known some SB\u2019s that vehemently avoid fucking married OLDER guys but were more than okay to fuck the HOT young married guy for money cuz, well, his wife is obviously a bitch for not taking his gorgeous \u201cD\u201d for a ride, that poor, young, broken man.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this forum (and in the bowl) long enough to see all sides of the selective morality dance.

They only consider the \u201cmarried\u201d part because it\u2019s a choice someone ELSE made and would in part, through some twisted sense of self, would make her feel \u201cdirty\u201d because he\u2019s married - NOT that she\u2019s fucking for cash.\n\nAnd one step further? I\u2019ve known some SB\u2019s that vehemently avoid fucking married OLDER guys but were more than okay to fuck the HOT young married guy for money cuz, well, his wife is obviously a bitch for not taking his gorgeous \u201cD\u201d for a ride, that poor, young, broken man.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this forum (and in the bowl) long enough to see all sides of the selective morality dance. And it never changes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEDIT: And the downvotes on this is AMAZING which only proves my point about all the butthurt snowflakes that cringe at the truth :)",
