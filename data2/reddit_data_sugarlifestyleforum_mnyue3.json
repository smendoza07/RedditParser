    "body": "Next week I am marrying my former SB. We have been together for four years.  We had both had sugar relationships before and we were both clear before the meet and greet about the fact that we were not looking for a monogamous relationship. \n\nDuring the meet and greet it was very clear to both of us that it was going to be very hard to keep the relationship casual.  Within five months we told each other we loved each other and soon thereafter we started planning for the rest of our lives. \n\nIt took a LONG time for me to work through my divorce but she supported me through all of it. \n\nWe weren\u2019t looking for it at the beginning of the relationship but here we are and we are so excited.",

Nothing in the universe happens without divine purpose and I am so happy for you two finding a natural and real connection - that is so hard. \n\nAlso, I better get back on seeking arrangements if I'm going to have any luck like this!

I feel confident that even with nothing being formally set out, there hasn\u2019t been anything she has wanted that she either didn\u2019t feel comfortable buying with the knowledge that I could just cover the bill or she would just suggest as a gift. \nOnce we moved in together then we just shared expenses and there wasn\u2019t anything separate.
