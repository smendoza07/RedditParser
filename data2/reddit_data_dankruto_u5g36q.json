He didn't learn any science I will give you and took very little if any of Orochimaru's philosophy. But heres the thing about the latter, that philosophy was wrong. Kabuto took it even further then Orochimaru did and Orochimaru realized looking at Kabuto that his views were a mistake that made neither of them any happier. Saying that taking bad lessons makes a good student is like saying Sakura would be a better student to Tsunade if she became a gambling addict or Naruto would be a better student if he was a sex offender. Those weren't the lessons worth taking.",

It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows.

Doesn't make a huge fuss about it or anything, just shows up while they're on a mission. \n\nThey go off and Sasuke versus Itachi and Naruto/Sakura just chat with Kisame at first but then Naruto and Sakura murder the fuck out of him (show their growth and team work). Kisame is awesome and everything but this is to show how far Naruto and Sakura has come. One Akatsuki member is not enough against the two. \n\n(I love Kisame so you could also have him get away, but it would be a great gateway to part 2 to show one of the biggest monsters of part 1 being destroyed)\n\nAfter this, Naruto becomes the main character again.",

The Sasuke episodes seemingly dragged on in Shippuden until they got to the action: Sasuke vs Bee's clone, Sasuke attacking the hokage summit. \n\nI don't know if Naruto and Sakura vs Kisame would work very well if they beat him, since Kisame was previously shown he could fight Kakashi, Asuma and Kurenai with Itachi's help. You'd have to explain a big jump in power in just 2 years.\n\nThough I think if they still did the Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori and Naruto and Kakashi vs Deidara, they could take out Kakashi for Sasuke in this situation and just have Deidara die/su*cide much earlier than before. And perhaps continously have Sasuke collide/teamup with new team 7 against every threat they would've killed in the main series, IE Kisame's su*cide against Killer Bee, Naruto and Yamato etc",

We have no attachment to Sasori and Sakura helping to defeat him doesn't really mean much as it doesn't already have context within the world. \n\nEven if it's just pushing him back and making him retreat would have worked so much better, narratively speaking. It's an organic way to show growth. You aren't telling us something, you're showing it. \n\nImagine Naruto had learned Sage mode during the training trip? Naruto learned it to help with learning Kurama's chakra (which have part 2 be about Naruto and Kurama actually bonding. Samehada can't absorb it, Sakura is a monster in her own right, and Naruto and her kick his ass. But we later learn that for as much of a monster Kisame is, he's just the start.",

Besides chakra control isn't Jiraiya's \"stuff\".\n\nLife lessons is a stretch and a half. \n\nEven rasengan is a stretch, Naruto had to figure that out on his own, the cat helped more than Jiraiya did. \n\nNaruto didn't learn any of Jiraiya's cool shit ninjutsu, like the Hair Needle or Swamp of the Underworld. Sasuke didn't learn any of Orochimaru's main gimmick weird shit tho. \n\nOut of the three Sakura is the only one to learn her master's stuff and surpass them in it.\n\nWhich isn't a knock on Naruto or Sasuke, they just aren't very good apprentices",

But Sakura is the only one of team 7 that seemed to be an actual apprentice. Sasuke seemed to do his own thing.\n\n===\n\nI mean, if we're not being biased, it would be something like Minato, Sakura, and Kabuto.\n\n\n===\n\nEdit: Though maybe Minato learned nothing from Jiraiya (he was just a super genius) and we can say the orphan trio were Jiraiya's best student(s)",

It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows.

At the end of the arc we get the Sasuke versus Orochimaru fight. Then, to start off part 2, Sasuke goes to Naruto and Sakura and just says \"come on, we're going to go kill Itachi\". Doesn't make a huge fuss about it or anything, just shows up while they're on a mission. \n\nThey go off and Sasuke versus Itachi and Naruto/Sakura just chat with Kisame at first but then Naruto and Sakura murder the fuck out of him (show their growth and team work). Kisame is awesome and everything but this is to show how far Naruto and Sakura has come. One Akatsuki member is not enough against the two. \n\n(I love Kisame so you could also have him get away, but it would be a great gateway to part 2 to show one of the biggest monsters of part 1 being destroyed)\n\nAfter this, Naruto becomes the main character again.",

The Sasuke episodes seemingly dragged on in Shippuden until they got to the action: Sasuke vs Bee's clone, Sasuke attacking the hokage summit. \n\nI don't know if Naruto and Sakura vs Kisame would work very well if they beat him, since Kisame was previously shown he could fight Kakashi, Asuma and Kurenai with Itachi's help. You'd have to explain a big jump in power in just 2 years.\n\nThough I think if they still did the Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori and Naruto and Kakashi vs Deidara, they could take out Kakashi for Sasuke in this situation and just have Deidara die/su*cide much earlier than before. And perhaps continously have Sasuke collide/teamup with new team 7 against every threat they would've killed in the main series, IE Kisame's su*cide against Killer Bee, Naruto and Yamato etc",

We have no attachment to Sasori and Sakura helping to defeat him doesn't really mean much as it doesn't already have context within the world. \n\nEven if it's just pushing him back and making him retreat would have worked so much better, narratively speaking. It's an organic way to show growth. You aren't telling us something, you're showing it. \n\nImagine Naruto had learned Sage mode during the training trip? Naruto learned it to help with learning Kurama's chakra (which have part 2 be about Naruto and Kurama actually bonding. Samehada can't absorb it, Sakura is a monster in her own right, and Naruto and her kick his ass. But we later learn that for as much of a monster Kisame is, he's just the start.",

Besides chakra control isn't Jiraiya's \"stuff\".\n\nLife lessons is a stretch and a half. \n\nEven rasengan is a stretch, Naruto had to figure that out on his own, the cat helped more than Jiraiya did. \n\nNaruto didn't learn any of Jiraiya's cool shit ninjutsu, like the Hair Needle or Swamp of the Underworld. Sasuke didn't learn any of Orochimaru's main gimmick weird shit tho. \n\nOut of the three Sakura is the only one to learn her master's stuff and surpass them in it.\n\nWhich isn't a knock on Naruto or Sasuke, they just aren't very good apprentices",

It would have been cool for example if Sakura had incorporated some genjutsu or Kabuto\u2019s medical fighting style to mix things up a bit.",

All the stuff we saw Naruto learn in part 2 (Sage/Elemental training) could have been done off screen during the time skip so that we see the more interesting dynamic between the two (ati have flashbacks tho).",

It's arbitrary to say that he has to have learned new things to have had a successful apprenticeship when that's clearly not the only way to make progress as a ninja; raw power evidentially comes a long way. \n\nAnd the assumption that Naruto would have improved his power level as much under anyone else comes from nowhere. It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows. Regardless, I think it's silly to say that it was pointless to go on the journey with Jiraiya based on the reasons I outline.",

Doesn't make a huge fuss about it or anything, just shows up while they're on a mission. \n\nThey go off and Sasuke versus Itachi and Naruto/Sakura just chat with Kisame at first but then Naruto and Sakura murder the fuck out of him (show their growth and team work). Kisame is awesome and everything but this is to show how far Naruto and Sakura has come. One Akatsuki member is not enough against the two. \n\n(I love Kisame so you could also have him get away, but it would be a great gateway to part 2 to show one of the biggest monsters of part 1 being destroyed)\n\nAfter this, Naruto becomes the main character again.",

You'd have to explain a big jump in power in just 2 years.\n\nThough I think if they still did the Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori and Naruto and Kakashi vs Deidara, they could take out Kakashi for Sasuke in this situation and just have Deidara die/su*cide much earlier than before. And perhaps continously have Sasuke collide/teamup with new team 7 against every threat they would've killed in the main series, IE Kisame's su*cide against Killer Bee, Naruto and Yamato etc",

I love the Sakura renaissance I've witnessed around this past few years years, before 15 NOBODY defended her. I'm an OG fan so I don't think y'all can change my mind but I welcome the discussion",

Kabuto took it even further then Orochimaru did and Orochimaru realized looking at Kabuto that his views were a mistake that made neither of them any happier. Saying that taking bad lessons makes a good student is like saying Sakura would be a better student to Tsunade if she became a gambling addict or Naruto would be a better student if he was a sex offender.

All the stuff we saw Naruto learn in part 2 (Sage/Elemental training) could have been done off screen during the time skip so that we see the more interesting dynamic between the two (ati have flashbacks tho).",

It's arbitrary to say that he has to have learned new things to have had a successful apprenticeship when that's clearly not the only way to make progress as a ninja; raw power evidentially comes a long way. \n\nAnd the assumption that Naruto would have improved his power level as much under anyone else comes from nowhere. It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows.

Doesn't make a huge fuss about it or anything, just shows up while they're on a mission. \n\nThey go off and Sasuke versus Itachi and Naruto/Sakura just chat with Kisame at first but then Naruto and Sakura murder the fuck out of him (show their growth and team work). Kisame is awesome and everything but this is to show how far Naruto and Sakura has come. One Akatsuki member is not enough against the two. \n\n(I love Kisame so you could also have him get away, but it would be a great gateway to part 2 to show one of the biggest monsters of part 1 being destroyed)\n\nAfter this, Naruto becomes the main character again.",

You'd have to explain a big jump in power in just 2 years.\n\nThough I think if they still did the Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori and Naruto and Kakashi vs Deidara, they could take out Kakashi for Sasuke in this situation and just have Deidara die/su*cide much earlier than before. And perhaps continously have Sasuke collide/teamup with new team 7 against every threat they would've killed in the main series, IE Kisame's su*cide against Killer Bee, Naruto and Yamato etc",

Naruto was getting it despite the seal. Jiraiya didn't teach Naruto to harness Kurama chakra, as Jiraiya didn't know squat about it. Besides chakra control isn't Jiraiya's \"stuff\".\n\nLife lessons is a stretch and a half. \n\nEven rasengan is a stretch, Naruto had to figure that out on his own, the cat helped more than Jiraiya did. \n\nNaruto didn't learn any of Jiraiya's cool shit ninjutsu, like the Hair Needle or Swamp of the Underworld. Sasuke didn't learn any of Orochimaru's main gimmick weird shit tho. \n\nOut of the three Sakura is the only one to learn her master's stuff and surpass them in it.\n\nWhich isn't a knock on Naruto or Sasuke, they just aren't very good apprentices",

Kabuto took it even further then Orochimaru did and Orochimaru realized looking at Kabuto that his views were a mistake that made neither of them any happier.

It's arbitrary to say that he has to have learned new things to have had a successful apprenticeship when that's clearly not the only way to make progress as a ninja; raw power evidentially comes a long way. \n\nAnd the assumption that Naruto would have improved his power level as much under anyone else comes from nowhere. It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows. Regardless, I think it's silly to say that it was pointless to go on the journey with Jiraiya based on the reasons I outline.",

Naruto needs something more than \"I can do the same things as before but bigger\". There needs to be something and with canon there's not. Sasuke and Sakura got their power boost and growth/change but Naruto is just Tall Naruto. \n\nShowing Naruto as a Sage can be more than just a power boost. Have being a true Sage means he has responsibilities to the toads. Jiraiya never completed his training, so this is something new for just Naruto. \n\nJiraiya learned nothing new from Jiraiya during the training trip and it just makes the time skip useless. Sasuke and Sakura aren't the title character, yet they both get new skills.",

Kisame is awesome and everything but this is to show how far Naruto and Sakura has come. One Akatsuki member is not enough against the two. \n\n(I love Kisame so you could also have him get away, but it would be a great gateway to part 2 to show one of the biggest monsters of part 1 being destroyed)\n\nAfter this, Naruto becomes the main character again.",

We have no attachment to Sasori and Sakura helping to defeat him doesn't really mean much as it doesn't already have context within the world. \n\nEven if it's just pushing him back and making him retreat would have worked so much better, narratively speaking. It's an organic way to show growth. You aren't telling us something, you're showing it. \n\nImagine Naruto had learned Sage mode during the training trip? Naruto learned it to help with learning Kurama's chakra (which have part 2 be about Naruto and Kurama actually bonding. Samehada can't absorb it, Sakura is a monster in her own right, and Naruto and her kick his ass. But we later learn that for as much of a monster Kisame is, he's just the start.",

It's arbitrary to say that he has to have learned new things to have had a successful apprenticeship when that's clearly not the only way to make progress as a ninja; raw power evidentially comes a long way. \n\nAnd the assumption that Naruto would have improved his power level as much under anyone else comes from nowhere. It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows. Regardless, I think it's silly to say that it was pointless to go on the journey with Jiraiya based on the reasons I outline.",

Sasuke and Sakura got their power boost and growth/change but Naruto is just Tall Naruto. \n\nShowing Naruto as a Sage can be more than just a power boost. Have being a true Sage means he has responsibilities to the toads. Jiraiya never completed his training, so this is something new for just Naruto. \n\nJiraiya learned nothing new from Jiraiya during the training trip and it just makes the time skip useless.

At the end of the arc we get the Sasuke versus Orochimaru fight. Then, to start off part 2, Sasuke goes to Naruto and Sakura and just says \"come on, we're going to go kill Itachi\". Doesn't make a huge fuss about it or anything, just shows up while they're on a mission. \n\nThey go off and Sasuke versus Itachi and Naruto/Sakura just chat with Kisame at first but then Naruto and Sakura murder the fuck out of him (show their growth and team work). Kisame is awesome and everything but this is to show how far Naruto and Sakura has come. One Akatsuki member is not enough against the two. \n\n(I love Kisame so you could also have him get away, but it would be a great gateway to part 2 to show one of the biggest monsters of part 1 being destroyed)\n\nAfter this, Naruto becomes the main character again.",

The Sasuke episodes seemingly dragged on in Shippuden until they got to the action: Sasuke vs Bee's clone, Sasuke attacking the hokage summit. \n\nI don't know if Naruto and Sakura vs Kisame would work very well if they beat him, since Kisame was previously shown he could fight Kakashi, Asuma and Kurenai with Itachi's help. You'd have to explain a big jump in power in just 2 years.\n\nThough I think if they still did the Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori and Naruto and Kakashi vs Deidara, they could take out Kakashi for Sasuke in this situation and just have Deidara die/su*cide much earlier than before. And perhaps continously have Sasuke collide/teamup with new team 7 against every threat they would've killed in the main series, IE Kisame's su*cide against Killer Bee, Naruto and Yamato etc",

We have no attachment to Sasori and Sakura helping to defeat him doesn't really mean much as it doesn't already have context within the world. \n\nEven if it's just pushing him back and making him retreat would have worked so much better, narratively speaking. It's an organic way to show growth. You aren't telling us something, you're showing it. \n\nImagine Naruto had learned Sage mode during the training trip? Naruto learned it to help with learning Kurama's chakra (which have part 2 be about Naruto and Kurama actually bonding. Samehada can't absorb it, Sakura is a monster in her own right, and Naruto and her kick his ass. But we later learn that for as much of a monster Kisame is, he's just the start.",

I didn't say Orochimaru was badly written, I said he was written like Ninja Hitler, and finding fault in Kishi for that is the same as complaining about how Kishi wrote Sakura when discussing whether or not she was weak or whatever. There's a time & place, since discussions about a story should stay about the story and not what happens outside it. \n\nWe need to know the context, but that's where the usefulness of it runs dry. Beyond that, we'll just be talking about the mangaka world's backstage.",

Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip. And that's not even to mention how Jiraiya passed on his ideology to Naruto.\n\nIdk why he didn't teach Naruto sage mode, but it's been a good couple years since I watched Naruto so who knows. Regardless, I think it's silly to say that it was pointless to go on the journey with Jiraiya based on the reasons I outline.",

Naruto needs something more than \"I can do the same things as before but bigger\". There needs to be something and with canon there's not. Sasuke and Sakura got their power boost and growth/change but Naruto is just Tall Naruto. \n\nShowing Naruto as a Sage can be more than just a power boost. Have being a true Sage means he has responsibilities to the toads. Jiraiya never completed his training, so this is something new for just Naruto. \n\nJiraiya learned nothing new from Jiraiya during the training trip and it just makes the time skip useless.

You'd have to explain a big jump in power in just 2 years.\n\nThough I think if they still did the Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori and Naruto and Kakashi vs Deidara, they could take out Kakashi for Sasuke in this situation and just have Deidara die/su*cide much earlier than before. And perhaps continously have Sasuke collide/teamup with new team 7 against every threat they would've killed in the main series, IE Kisame's su*cide against Killer Bee, Naruto and Yamato etc",

It's pure speculation. Nothing in the show indicates that, while it *does* indicate repeatedly that Jiraiya was a better fit for Naruto at that time.\n\nAdditionally, his tactics *were* better as seen with, among other things, the redo of the bell training right after the time-skip.

Sasuke and Sakura got their power boost and growth/change but Naruto is just Tall Naruto. \n\nShowing Naruto as a Sage can be more than just a power boost. Have being a true Sage means he has responsibilities to the toads. Jiraiya never completed his training, so this is something new for just Naruto. \n\nJiraiya learned nothing new from Jiraiya during the training trip and it just makes the time skip useless.
