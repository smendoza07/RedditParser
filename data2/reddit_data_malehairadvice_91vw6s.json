Shampoo I also use Tresemme but, also not big on shampoo.

I'm starting to get used to taking care of my hair as much as possible, since this is easily the longest my hair has ever been, usually it's been maybe 1-2 inches, now it's probably about 7 *maybe* 8. It's at the point where I could part it, but since its wavy it doesnt look good enough yet, especially with the hair on the sides only being ~2 inches, but hoping by around October it will be long enough to part and look good.",

Shampoo I also use Tresemme but, also not big on shampoo. Usually I'll tie it back in the morning when I workout and in the evening during football practice, but during the day doing anything else I'll let it do it's own thing, which isnt always a good idea, but most of the time it's fine. I'm starting to get used to taking care of my hair as much as possible, since this is easily the longest my hair has ever been, usually it's been maybe 1-2 inches, now it's probably about 7 *maybe* 8. It's at the point where I could part it, but since its wavy it doesnt look good enough yet, especially with the hair on the sides only being ~2 inches, but hoping by around October it will be long enough to part and look good.",

Shampoo I also use Tresemme but, also not big on shampoo. Usually I'll tie it back in the morning when I workout and in the evening during football practice, but during the day doing anything else I'll let it do it's own thing, which isnt always a good idea, but most of the time it's fine. I'm starting to get used to taking care of my hair as much as possible, since this is easily the longest my hair has ever been, usually it's been maybe 1-2 inches, now it's probably about 7 *maybe* 8. It's at the point where I could part it, but since its wavy it doesnt look good enough yet, especially with the hair on the sides only being ~2 inches, but hoping by around October it will be long enough to part and look good.",

Usually I'll tie it back in the morning when I workout and in the evening during football practice, but during the day doing anything else I'll let it do it's own thing, which isnt always a good idea, but most of the time it's fine. I'm starting to get used to taking care of my hair as much as possible, since this is easily the longest my hair has ever been, usually it's been maybe 1-2 inches, now it's probably about 7 *maybe* 8. It's at the point where I could part it, but since its wavy it doesnt look good enough yet, especially with the hair on the sides only being ~2 inches, but hoping by around October it will be long enough to part and look good.",

I work a part time job at a gym and am a realtor by day so sometimes I tie it but generally I love it open. Wbu?",
