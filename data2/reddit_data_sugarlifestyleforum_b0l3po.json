    "body": "So, he retired way too early, pretty much did nothing except trade and 'manage' his business and typical middle aged athletic dude activities. \n\n\nWhen I first met him, Ben Shapiro audiobooks and Bloomberg articles were pretty much the only things he was interested in reading.  \n\n\nI made fun of him for it, *hard*. \n\n\n\n(inb4 I disrespect my SD. If yr not roasting one another for the sake of self improvement, what are u here for) \n\nI would go on huge ass rants about his lack of curiosity every once in a while and how \"he didn't know about anything other than business\" \n\n(which is completely fair because \n\n**One** - He legitimately knows only about business, surfing, andd cars and \n\n\n**Two** - He makes fun of me for being an economically illiterate liberal who \"can't park properly\"(which is fair because I'm really bad at econ and I ruined his car))\n\nI guess I  struck a chord during one of those rants because after I moved far far away he went out and bought himself text books. \n\nPhysics text books. \nPsychology text books.\nBiology text books. \n\nAnd this mother fucker sits down and teaches himself physics because I called him out on it. \n\nSo anyway, I'm doing the med school thing and he's been really keen on talking biology with me. \n\nLast week he sent me \"Did you know cells are the building blocks of life?\" \nEvery week, he sends me new texts that show me how far into the Intro to Bio book he's in. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/f82zYOs\n\nHe has not stopped talking about plants. \nI think he really likes botany. \n\n\n:') love him.\n",
