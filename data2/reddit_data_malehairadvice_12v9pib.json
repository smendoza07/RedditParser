The volume you see here is not super easy to achieve with too much length. When it\u2019s longer, it can\u2019t have as much weight because it gets oily, and it looks more similar to that last post. Still that post was on a good hair day when it had more individual strands. Honestly if you have advice for that, it\u2019s welcome",

I personally have extremely fine hair, so when I had it truly long I felt like it was always wispy and formless. Not great. If it got dirty/tousled as my hair was in that picture, it just started looking oily and incel-gamer esque. Shortening it definitely allowed me to give it some more volume (sea salt spray is awesome for that too!) \n\nThat being said, with the right mastery of products, you can make absolutely beautiful, fantasy knight long hair. I don\u2019t deny it, but I never found that skill, and if I\u2019m being honest, I feel way better about myself knowing that I cut my hair like 3 times a year from a cheap barber and it requires almost zero maintenance. Also, if your hair isn\u2019t like mine you might never have those issues. Thick curly hair almost always has the potential to look great when it\u2019s long imo.",

The volume you see here is not super easy to achieve with too much length. When it\u2019s longer, it can\u2019t have as much weight because it gets oily, and it looks more similar to that last post. Still that post was on a good hair day when it had more individual strands. Honestly if you have advice for that, it\u2019s welcome",

If it got dirty/tousled as my hair was in that picture, it just started looking oily and incel-gamer esque. Shortening it definitely allowed me to give it some more volume (sea salt spray is awesome for that too!) \n\nThat being said, with the right mastery of products, you can make absolutely beautiful, fantasy knight long hair. I don\u2019t deny it, but I never found that skill, and if I\u2019m being honest, I feel way better about myself knowing that I cut my hair like 3 times a year from a cheap barber and it requires almost zero maintenance. Also, if your hair isn\u2019t like mine you might never have those issues. Thick curly hair almost always has the potential to look great when it\u2019s long imo.",
