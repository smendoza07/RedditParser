The style itself isn't very complicated being combed and slicked back, but it takes advantage of Clint's naturally wavy and voluminous hair to give it that particular appearance. If you have straighter or thinner hair than Eastwood you'll want your hair to be just a little bit longer than how his is cut so you can use the additional length to simulate the texture and thickness. Blowdrying and using a strong hold aerosol hairspray might yield the desired results as you will be able to give your hair a more wavy texture with the blow dryer and can then hold the style in place with the hairspray.",
