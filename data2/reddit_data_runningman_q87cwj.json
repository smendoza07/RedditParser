You can see them trying their best despite varying levels in their ability - some had only experience from primary school badminton sessions while some had been coached by national players. Years of experience ranging from 0 months to 30 years (?) according to the show. Sechan emerged as top 2 among the 9 members despite 2 months  of training (stated in the show). The judges which included 2008 olympic badminton gold medalist commended that sechan reacts very fast to the shuttlecock (evident in RM at times)and always repositioned myself back to the centre of the court - this made him last very long on the court and eventually win. Although he needs to correct his wrong posture (? not sure what was wrong because I don't play badminton) but it could be certainly corrected with practice over the next few episodes.\n\nThe biggest attractive point of this show is that there are plans for a finale competition (not sure about the details) but the coach was very serious and determined about that. So if you like sechan and is interested, do support his new show!",

Yes, his footwork is wrong (a common sight for beginners) but his sense of movement is in the right place.\n\nIn singles gameplay, the player has to return to the middle of the court for better \"court coverage\" since there are 8 corners to cover : Front, Front-right, Front-left, Right, Left, Back, Back-right and Back-left. Making sure to go back to the middle helps in reducing the time needed to go to each corner for both attacking and defending plays.\n\nIf you look closely at his steps, he sometimes does a little springy hop after a shot which is a very overlooked technique when people get into badminton. This hop is able to significantly improve reaction time as it helps your body pace itself for the timing of the opponent's shots. Needs refinement, but very impressive stuff from YSC regardless.\n\nFurthermore, YSC was able to display a multitude of shot selection which was impressive for a beginner. As long as he has the idea in his mind, he can play these shots to a much better efficency once he improves his techniques(which he definitely will if he trains consistently for the show).\n\nAll in all, I'm really enjoying that YSC is showing off his sporty side more and more! From the high jump, to golf and badminton, YSC is a really underrated entertainer. I hope to see mature and develop as a badmintom player throughout this show! HUGE THANKS to OP for sharing this show to us! I will give it a watch ![img](emote|t5_2u830|5032)",

I am honestly amazed by his skills considering his busy schedule and how he practiced for only 2 months (I think?) for this show.\n\nOn another note, what can you say about Sanguk haha poor guy is such a newbie but he's also so funny with his sabre/fencing lunges. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, glad you're inspired to watch the show!
