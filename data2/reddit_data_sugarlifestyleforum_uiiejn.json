If I didnt do it it would escalate into her threaten to call the police and get me falsely arrested for DV, cause a scene when my status with aoao was literally close to forcing me to sell, pretend things were only mildly bad then start driving crazy when we got in the car. She had texts and recordings of me writing weird shit on ambien and threatened to show them to my family and claim I was using street drugs as I had in the past. \n\nIm just not the same sexual person anymore.  I think I went to sugaring in part because I need the sexual motivation of the best looking women combined with the security of relationships with boundaries to feel fully sexual.\n\nIm not going to say I was raped because I think it was more like sexual extortion.  But I understand sexual abuse better than Id like.",

If you're switching from vaginal to that, there should be at least a moment of \"is it ok if I...\" Since she may not be prepared/in the mood for that. V.S. changing positions while still in vaginal, which could reasonably be expected to be part of sex. \n\nIt's kind of just common sense. If there's any question or potential doubt, better to ask.

And I made it clear it wasn't ok and they did it anyway. The people who are going to take advantage of someone being drunk/ passed out or hold them down and do it anyway are still going to do those things.  Even if 90% of the men in the world asked for consent before every single thing. I can understand maybe asking once the first time you are together if she's sure this is something she wants.  But before every act is ridiculous. If we're talking BDSM or something away from the \"norm\" than yes conversations need to be had. But that's a different conversation than what the OP said.",

Can consent be implied nonverbally? Totally! No one expects you to ask every time you kiss, especially when both parties are showing enthusiasm.\n\nNow if your partner has an unclear reaction to something you're doing e.g. freezing up a little, it's probably good to check in, which doesn't always mean \"is this ok\" but could be something along the lines of \"do you like that?\" It doesnt have to be \"may I penetrate you vaginally\" it can be \"tell me how badly you want me to fuck you\". Long story short if there's any doubt, you can still have fun while checking in. \n\nI think the misunderstanding of points like OP's is that all couples communicate differently and there's never going to be one perfect formula to discern consent. We tried \"no means no\" and you end up with cases of people getting raped while crying, then the rapist says \"well they never actually said no\". Interpreting that literally clearly doesn't work. So we get enthusiastic consent. And yes, ask if you're unsure is the safest bet, but no, there isn't some secret agenda to stop people from having sex without asking every few minutes. And this one shouldn't be taken 100% literally either.",

People should be aware NOT consenting has many other forms than loudly saying no and that there are sensual ways of asking for consent, yes, but boundaries and silent cues/how people show consent differ from person to person.",

But it is a little strange to navigate still at times with a new partner. Very few men want to be rapists. But I think the onus is on men to listen to both verbal and nonverbal (body language mostly) communication, especially that first time. I have never had a woman after the first time ever accuse me of taking it too far (and I always have talked to them after), so I don't see this as a problem for me, but I also recognize that it is absolutely a problem for a lot of men.\n\nMaybe an SB has some tips for navigating the dominant and rough sex world when it comes to consent from their perspective, because I think I would even learn something.",

She was penetrated and her consent wasn\u2019t valid, so she\u2019s a victim. They were not penetrated so they can\u2019t claim to be a victim even though their consent is also invalid.\n\nMany jurisdictions say to be raped is to be penetrated without valid consent.  To rape is to penetrate without valid consent.  Therefore in drunken heterosexual sex, the male is by definition a rapist and the female a rape victim.\n\nAgain, you can find cases in the news where this was the case.\n\n(I\u2019m not saying this is fair, I\u2019m saying that\u2019s often the law).",

Me and my SB's have great times together, drinking very expensive bottles of aged wine and whiskeys. And we joke with each other about the drunk consent laws.\n\nThese 3 rules are also definitely false, and nothing I will ever be following:\n\n*- Asking permission before you change the type or degree of sexual activity with phrases like \u201cIs this OK?\u201d*\n\n*- Confirming that there is reciprocal interest before initiating any physical touch.*\n\n*- Periodically checking in with your partner, such as asking \u201cIs this still okay?\u201d*\n\nNone of that is true. Instinct and common sense around non-verbal cues, has worked perfectly since I was 15 years old, and will continue to work just fine.",

            "body": "Specifically what defines sexual assault or rape varies depending on the jurisdiction in question.     \n\nWhat constitutes valid consent similarly varies.   In most college title ix cases for example,  it\u2019s acknowledged consent was given, the issue is typically whether the consent was valid or not.  Drinking is a common reason, but more and more we are seeing instances where consent is deemed invalid because the woman didn\u2019t feel she could say no.     \n\nAlso at issue is penetration.   Most states say rape is to be penetrated without valid consent, the penetrated person being the victim, the penetrator being the perpetrator.   Therefore in heterosexual sex, where consent is invalid due to drinking, the male is by definition the perp and the woman the victim even if both equally consent, equally drunk.   \n\nSome states such as Georgia still define rape as a crime committed by men against women.  By statute a man can\u2019t be raped.   (Though he can be a victim of other sex crimes).  \n\nThe age of consent also varies from state to state and country to country.  \n\nThe bottom line is you should know what law or policy applies to your location or situation.",

If you're switching from vaginal to that, there should be at least a moment of \"is it ok if I...\" Since she may not be prepared/in the mood for that. V.S. changing positions while still in vaginal, which could reasonably be expected to be part of sex. \n\nIt's kind of just common sense. If there's any question or potential doubt, better to ask.

If I'm there and participating,  unless I say no or do this instead,  he has consent. \n\nBefore anyone says I don't understand if I've never been assaulted...I have, on more than one occasion.  And I made it clear it wasn't ok and they did it anyway. The people who are going to take advantage of someone being drunk/ passed out or hold them down and do it anyway are still going to do those things.  Even if 90% of the men in the world asked for consent before every single thing. I can understand maybe asking once the first time you are together if she's sure this is something she wants.

Can consent be implied nonverbally? Totally! No one expects you to ask every time you kiss, especially when both parties are showing enthusiasm.\n\nNow if your partner has an unclear reaction to something you're doing e.g. freezing up a little, it's probably good to check in, which doesn't always mean \"is this ok\" but could be something along the lines of \"do you like that?\" It doesnt have to be \"may I penetrate you vaginally\" it can be \"tell me how badly you want me to fuck you\". Long story short if there's any doubt, you can still have fun while checking in. \n\nI think the misunderstanding of points like OP's is that all couples communicate differently and there's never going to be one perfect formula to discern consent. We tried \"no means no\" and you end up with cases of people getting raped while crying, then the rapist says \"well they never actually said no\". Interpreting that literally clearly doesn't work. So we get enthusiastic consent. And yes, ask if you're unsure is the safest bet, but no, there isn't some secret agenda to stop people from having sex without asking every few minutes. And this one shouldn't be taken 100% literally either.",

She was penetrated and her consent wasn\u2019t valid, so she\u2019s a victim. They were not penetrated so they can\u2019t claim to be a victim even though their consent is also invalid.\n\nMany jurisdictions say to be raped is to be penetrated without valid consent.  To rape is to penetrate without valid consent.  Therefore in drunken heterosexual sex, the male is by definition a rapist and the female a rape victim.\n\nAgain, you can find cases in the news where this was the case.\n\n(I\u2019m not saying this is fair, I\u2019m saying that\u2019s often the law).",

Can consent be implied nonverbally? Totally! No one expects you to ask every time you kiss, especially when both parties are showing enthusiasm.\n\nNow if your partner has an unclear reaction to something you're doing e.g. freezing up a little, it's probably good to check in, which doesn't always mean \"is this ok\" but could be something along the lines of \"do you like that?\" It doesnt have to be \"may I penetrate you vaginally\" it can be \"tell me how badly you want me to fuck you\". Long story short if there's any doubt, you can still have fun while checking in. \n\nI think the misunderstanding of points like OP's is that all couples communicate differently and there's never going to be one perfect formula to discern consent. We tried \"no means no\" and you end up with cases of people getting raped while crying, then the rapist says \"well they never actually said no\". Interpreting that literally clearly doesn't work. So we get enthusiastic consent. And yes, ask if you're unsure is the safest bet, but no, there isn't some secret agenda to stop people from having sex without asking every few minutes. And this one shouldn't be taken 100% literally either.",

Can consent be implied nonverbally? Totally! No one expects you to ask every time you kiss, especially when both parties are showing enthusiasm.\n\nNow if your partner has an unclear reaction to something you're doing e.g. freezing up a little, it's probably good to check in, which doesn't always mean \"is this ok\" but could be something along the lines of \"do you like that?\" It doesnt have to be \"may I penetrate you vaginally\" it can be \"tell me how badly you want me to fuck you\". Long story short if there's any doubt, you can still have fun while checking in. \n\nI think the misunderstanding of points like OP's is that all couples communicate differently and there's never going to be one perfect formula to discern consent. We tried \"no means no\" and you end up with cases of people getting raped while crying, then the rapist says \"well they never actually said no\". Interpreting that literally clearly doesn't work. So we get enthusiastic consent. And yes, ask if you're unsure is the safest bet, but no, there isn't some secret agenda to stop people from having sex without asking every few minutes. And this one shouldn't be taken 100% literally either.",

Can consent be implied nonverbally? Totally! No one expects you to ask every time you kiss, especially when both parties are showing enthusiasm.\n\nNow if your partner has an unclear reaction to something you're doing e.g. freezing up a little, it's probably good to check in, which doesn't always mean \"is this ok\" but could be something along the lines of \"do you like that?\" It doesnt have to be \"may I penetrate you vaginally\" it can be \"tell me how badly you want me to fuck you\". Long story short if there's any doubt, you can still have fun while checking in. \n\nI think the misunderstanding of points like OP's is that all couples communicate differently and there's never going to be one perfect formula to discern consent. We tried \"no means no\" and you end up with cases of people getting raped while crying, then the rapist says \"well they never actually said no\". Interpreting that literally clearly doesn't work. So we get enthusiastic consent. And yes, ask if you're unsure is the safest bet, but no, there isn't some secret agenda to stop people from having sex without asking every few minutes. And this one shouldn't be taken 100% literally either.",
