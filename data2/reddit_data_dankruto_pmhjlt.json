There are lots of shitty women, but the shitty women are also most often the most vocal ones, no different from shitty men often being the vocal ones. I don't think any of the women I know believe domestic abuse of any type is okay. And, FWIW, I'm also a woman and have been agreeing with you on every point you've made. \n\nTbh, the majority of people I know IRL agree that abuse towards men is a real thing, which is why I think things are changing. The internet skews things and is not always reflective of how regular people think. I've been on the other side of it, where the internet made me believe that men despise women deep down inside, but that's obviously not true.",

A protagonist fighting an antagonist because of a moral dispute is not the same as someone hitting their spouse. A couple is *supposed to be a team and should  love and respect each other*. There should be no room for violence in a relationship that's meant to be intimate. Hell, I'd be mad if someone physically abused a close friend who they're not even dating. \n\nI gotta say, I feel bad for Shikamaru overall. Like yeah, she used to hit him even before they started dating, but after 13-14 years, it's gotta beat a man down in his soul. I dunno why he rolled with it. It feels like between his marriage and his job, his old *mendokuse* self is mostly gone. \n\nAlso, the child abuse is inexcusable, period. Shikadai doesn't deserve that.",

ShikaTema is rife with physical/verbal abuse (the topic of this thread). Naruto is neglectful of Hinata and his kids. Sasuke is neglectful of his family, and his marriage is basically a sham. From what limited interactions I've seen, Choji and Karui don't even understand each other. None of them are in tune with their spouse's emotional needs.",

Naruto isn't Neglectful of his family, he just can't be with them often because of work. This is evident in the movie when we get a glimpse in his office and boruto looks at the framed photos. We his hand marks on them  clearly indicating they've been held tightly and for long periods of time. He also tries and does stuff with them, even when he isn't mentally or physically able to. Like on the parent day episode when he took himawari out for family day even though he was insanely tired and was out of Chakra, and he did whatever he could to do whatever it is she wanted. \n\nAnd Sasuke literally can't be with his family since he's still serving his sentence. I've explained to someone else on this thread, but basically Sasuke is on a life sentence of sorts to track down anything related to otsosuki and zetsu, and destroy it. Then report in to Naruto and the hokage of what he found and saw on his mission. And his life belongs to Naruto. Naruto basically owns him, and if he were to go out of line, Naruto would have to kill him personally. That's his punishment, and was the alternative to death or life imprisonment. \n\nSasuSaku still sucks balls though.\n\nChojis relationship seems to actually be going pretty well and seems to be like a normal relationship. Not a married relationship, but like a normal newly wed type of thing. Although, at the current state, they've been married for like 10+ years, they should know eachother better by now. But they still going strong and have a healthy relationship. Just a slower one then most",

Like, I get it's gag comedy, but constantly hitting (really hard) your husband and kid for isn't really cool, even if there's a reason to be upset. Imagine Shikamaru doing that to Temari, or him fighting back with equivalent force. Yes, yes, I've been told, \"It's just an anime. You're okay with killing and murder, but not okay with some slapstick comedy?\" Maybe that's fair, I dunno. It just makes me uncomfortable and I feel really bad for Shikamaru and Shikadai.

Was kaguya even hurt by him though \ud83d\ude02 like she's just so damn strong \ud83d\ude02 she felt no pain at all. The only time she visibly showed pain was when Kakashi used chidori on her and she got whiplash when Sakura hit her. \n\nBut I'd still say konan was sane. Insane wound be someone like Sasuke deidera or hidan. Konan and nagato had good reasons and morals and were open to here others opinions. Straying from the right path doesn't exactly mean insanity. It could mean many things.",

Choji and his bitch have no screen time but seem to be in a positive relationship and inosai is a normal and typical relationship and is actually super wholesome when you consider how the characters originally were, to how they are now. Sai speaks up more and shows more emotion when around ino, and ino isn't Sakura 2.0 anymore.",

I mean, SasuSaku sucks in general and Sakura is not great, I'm just purely commenting on Sasuke. \n\nShikamaru and Shikadai don't deserve what they're getting for sure. If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

She sucks dick now. Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

There are lots of shitty women, but the shitty women are also most often the most vocal ones, no different from shitty men often being the vocal ones. I don't think any of the women I know believe domestic abuse of any type is okay. And, FWIW, I'm also a woman and have been agreeing with you on every point you've made. \n\nTbh, the majority of people I know IRL agree that abuse towards men is a real thing, which is why I think things are changing. The internet skews things and is not always reflective of how regular people think. I've been on the other side of it, where the internet made me believe that men despise women deep down inside, but that's obviously not true.",

A protagonist fighting an antagonist because of a moral dispute is not the same as someone hitting their spouse. A couple is *supposed to be a team and should  love and respect each other*. There should be no room for violence in a relationship that's meant to be intimate. Hell, I'd be mad if someone physically abused a close friend who they're not even dating. \n\nI gotta say, I feel bad for Shikamaru overall. Like yeah, she used to hit him even before they started dating, but after 13-14 years, it's gotta beat a man down in his soul. I dunno why he rolled with it. It feels like between his marriage and his job, his old *mendokuse* self is mostly gone. \n\nAlso, the child abuse is inexcusable, period. Shikadai doesn't deserve that.",

ShikaTema is rife with physical/verbal abuse (the topic of this thread). Naruto is neglectful of Hinata and his kids. Sasuke is neglectful of his family, and his marriage is basically a sham. From what limited interactions I've seen, Choji and Karui don't even understand each other. None of them are in tune with their spouse's emotional needs.",

This is evident in the movie when we get a glimpse in his office and boruto looks at the framed photos. We his hand marks on them  clearly indicating they've been held tightly and for long periods of time. He also tries and does stuff with them, even when he isn't mentally or physically able to. Like on the parent day episode when he took himawari out for family day even though he was insanely tired and was out of Chakra, and he did whatever he could to do whatever it is she wanted. \n\nAnd Sasuke literally can't be with his family since he's still serving his sentence. I've explained to someone else on this thread, but basically Sasuke is on a life sentence of sorts to track down anything related to otsosuki and zetsu, and destroy it. Then report in to Naruto and the hokage of what he found and saw on his mission. And his life belongs to Naruto. Naruto basically owns him, and if he were to go out of line, Naruto would have to kill him personally. That's his punishment, and was the alternative to death or life imprisonment. \n\nSasuSaku still sucks balls though.\n\nChojis relationship seems to actually be going pretty well and seems to be like a normal relationship. Not a married relationship, but like a normal newly wed type of thing. Although, at the current state, they've been married for like 10+ years, they should know eachother better by now. But they still going strong and have a healthy relationship. Just a slower one then most",

Imagine Shikamaru doing that to Temari, or him fighting back with equivalent force. Yes, yes, I've been told, \"It's just an anime. You're okay with killing and murder, but not okay with some slapstick comedy?\" Maybe that's fair, I dunno. It just makes me uncomfortable and I feel really bad for Shikamaru and Shikadai.

He only ever seemed to like his wife. I don't think Temari knows what a family is supposed to be like much more than Gaara does. That any of them turned out remotely normal is a miracle (and I wouldn't really say Kankuro is normal either).",

If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS. She was a great kunoichi.",

She sucks dick now. Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

There are lots of shitty women, but the shitty women are also most often the most vocal ones, no different from shitty men often being the vocal ones. I don't think any of the women I know believe domestic abuse of any type is okay. And, FWIW, I'm also a woman and have been agreeing with you on every point you've made. \n\nTbh, the majority of people I know IRL agree that abuse towards men is a real thing, which is why I think things are changing. The internet skews things and is not always reflective of how regular people think. I've been on the other side of it, where the internet made me believe that men despise women deep down inside, but that's obviously not true.",

I think some other commenter was saying they get shit on with the reasoning of like, \"Oh, you're okay with fighting and murder but not okay with this\", but it's not the same. A protagonist fighting an antagonist because of a moral dispute is not the same as someone hitting their spouse. A couple is *supposed to be a team and should  love and respect each other*. There should be no room for violence in a relationship that's meant to be intimate. Hell, I'd be mad if someone physically abused a close friend who they're not even dating. \n\nI gotta say, I feel bad for Shikamaru overall. Like yeah, she used to hit him even before they started dating, but after 13-14 years, it's gotta beat a man down in his soul. I dunno why he rolled with it. It feels like between his marriage and his job, his old *mendokuse* self is mostly gone. \n\nAlso, the child abuse is inexcusable, period. Shikadai doesn't deserve that.",

ShikaTema is rife with physical/verbal abuse (the topic of this thread). Naruto is neglectful of Hinata and his kids. Sasuke is neglectful of his family, and his marriage is basically a sham. From what limited interactions I've seen, Choji and Karui don't even understand each other. None of them are in tune with their spouse's emotional needs.",

This is evident in the movie when we get a glimpse in his office and boruto looks at the framed photos. We his hand marks on them  clearly indicating they've been held tightly and for long periods of time. He also tries and does stuff with them, even when he isn't mentally or physically able to. Like on the parent day episode when he took himawari out for family day even though he was insanely tired and was out of Chakra, and he did whatever he could to do whatever it is she wanted. \n\nAnd Sasuke literally can't be with his family since he's still serving his sentence. I've explained to someone else on this thread, but basically Sasuke is on a life sentence of sorts to track down anything related to otsosuki and zetsu, and destroy it. Then report in to Naruto and the hokage of what he found and saw on his mission. And his life belongs to Naruto. Naruto basically owns him, and if he were to go out of line, Naruto would have to kill him personally. That's his punishment, and was the alternative to death or life imprisonment. \n\nSasuSaku still sucks balls though.\n\nChojis relationship seems to actually be going pretty well and seems to be like a normal relationship. Not a married relationship, but like a normal newly wed type of thing. Although, at the current state, they've been married for like 10+ years, they should know eachother better by now. But they still going strong and have a healthy relationship. Just a slower one then most",

Imagine Shikamaru doing that to Temari, or him fighting back with equivalent force. Yes, yes, I've been told, \"It's just an anime.

If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

She sucks dick now. Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

There should be no room for violence in a relationship that's meant to be intimate. Hell, I'd be mad if someone physically abused a close friend who they're not even dating. \n\nI gotta say, I feel bad for Shikamaru overall. Like yeah, she used to hit him even before they started dating, but after 13-14 years, it's gotta beat a man down in his soul. I dunno why he rolled with it.

This is evident in the movie when we get a glimpse in his office and boruto looks at the framed photos. We his hand marks on them  clearly indicating they've been held tightly and for long periods of time. He also tries and does stuff with them, even when he isn't mentally or physically able to. Like on the parent day episode when he took himawari out for family day even though he was insanely tired and was out of Chakra, and he did whatever he could to do whatever it is she wanted. \n\nAnd Sasuke literally can't be with his family since he's still serving his sentence. I've explained to someone else on this thread, but basically Sasuke is on a life sentence of sorts to track down anything related to otsosuki and zetsu, and destroy it. Then report in to Naruto and the hokage of what he found and saw on his mission. And his life belongs to Naruto. Naruto basically owns him, and if he were to go out of line, Naruto would have to kill him personally. That's his punishment, and was the alternative to death or life imprisonment. \n\nSasuSaku still sucks balls though.\n\nChojis relationship seems to actually be going pretty well and seems to be like a normal relationship. Not a married relationship, but like a normal newly wed type of thing. Although, at the current state, they've been married for like 10+ years, they should know eachother better by now. But they still going strong and have a healthy relationship. Just a slower one then most",

If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

She sucks dick now. Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Like on the parent day episode when he took himawari out for family day even though he was insanely tired and was out of Chakra, and he did whatever he could to do whatever it is she wanted. \n\nAnd Sasuke literally can't be with his family since he's still serving his sentence. I've explained to someone else on this thread, but basically Sasuke is on a life sentence of sorts to track down anything related to otsosuki and zetsu, and destroy it. Then report in to Naruto and the hokage of what he found and saw on his mission. And his life belongs to Naruto. Naruto basically owns him, and if he were to go out of line, Naruto would have to kill him personally. That's his punishment, and was the alternative to death or life imprisonment. \n\nSasuSaku still sucks balls though.\n\nChojis relationship seems to actually be going pretty well and seems to be like a normal relationship. Not a married relationship, but like a normal newly wed type of thing. Although, at the current state, they've been married for like 10+ years, they should know eachother better by now. But they still going strong and have a healthy relationship. Just a slower one then most",

Like, I get it's gag comedy, but constantly hitting (really hard) your husband and kid for isn't really cool, even if there's a reason to be upset. Imagine Shikamaru doing that to Temari, or him fighting back with equivalent force. Yes, yes, I've been told, \"It's just an anime. You're okay with killing and murder, but not okay with some slapstick comedy?\" Maybe that's fair, I dunno. It just makes me uncomfortable and I feel really bad for Shikamaru and Shikadai. Shikamaru is probably always walking on eggshells.",

Naruhina is failing because of work, well it would be if hinata wasn't understanding, Sasusaku was never any good,  ShikaTema is abusive and I demand a divorce or a rewrite where Shikamaru and temari work things out. Choji and his bitch have no screen time but seem to be in a positive relationship and inosai is a normal and typical relationship and is actually super wholesome when you consider how the characters originally were, to how they are now. Sai speaks up more and shows more emotion when around ino, and ino isn't Sakura 2.0 anymore.",

I mean, SasuSaku sucks in general and Sakura is not great, I'm just purely commenting on Sasuke. \n\nShikamaru and Shikadai don't deserve what they're getting for sure. If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

There are lots of shitty women, but the shitty women are also most often the most vocal ones, no different from shitty men often being the vocal ones. I don't think any of the women I know believe domestic abuse of any type is okay. And, FWIW, I'm also a woman and have been agreeing with you on every point you've made. \n\nTbh, the majority of people I know IRL agree that abuse towards men is a real thing, which is why I think things are changing. The internet skews things and is not always reflective of how regular people think. I've been on the other side of it, where the internet made me believe that men despise women deep down inside, but that's obviously not true.",

This is evident in the movie when we get a glimpse in his office and boruto looks at the framed photos. We his hand marks on them  clearly indicating they've been held tightly and for long periods of time. He also tries and does stuff with them, even when he isn't mentally or physically able to. Like on the parent day episode when he took himawari out for family day even though he was insanely tired and was out of Chakra, and he did whatever he could to do whatever it is she wanted. \n\nAnd Sasuke literally can't be with his family since he's still serving his sentence. I've explained to someone else on this thread, but basically Sasuke is on a life sentence of sorts to track down anything related to otsosuki and zetsu, and destroy it. Then report in to Naruto and the hokage of what he found and saw on his mission. And his life belongs to Naruto. Naruto basically owns him, and if he were to go out of line, Naruto would have to kill him personally. That's his punishment, and was the alternative to death or life imprisonment. \n\nSasuSaku still sucks balls though.\n\nChojis relationship seems to actually be going pretty well and seems to be like a normal relationship. Not a married relationship, but like a normal newly wed type of thing. Although, at the current state, they've been married for like 10+ years, they should know eachother better by now. But they still going strong and have a healthy relationship. Just a slower one then most",

He's not physically or verbally abusive, but he isn't a good husband and is emotionally withholding, which is a form of abuse, and Sakura just doesn't do anything about it. I mean, SasuSaku sucks in general and Sakura is not great, I'm just purely commenting on Sasuke. \n\nShikamaru and Shikadai don't deserve what they're getting for sure. If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS. She was a great kunoichi.",

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

I don't think any of the women I know believe domestic abuse of any type is okay. And, FWIW, I'm also a woman and have been agreeing with you on every point you've made. \n\nTbh, the majority of people I know IRL agree that abuse towards men is a real thing, which is why I think things are changing. The internet skews things and is not always reflective of how regular people think. I've been on the other side of it, where the internet made me believe that men despise women deep down inside, but that's obviously not true.",

He only ever seemed to like his wife. I don't think Temari knows what a family is supposed to be like much more than Gaara does. That any of them turned out remotely normal is a miracle (and I wouldn't really say Kankuro is normal either).",

Choji and his bitch have no screen time but seem to be in a positive relationship and inosai is a normal and typical relationship and is actually super wholesome when you consider how the characters originally were, to how they are now.

If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Choji and his bitch have no screen time but seem to be in a positive relationship and inosai is a normal and typical relationship and is actually super wholesome when you consider how the characters originally were, to how they are now.

I mean, SasuSaku sucks in general and Sakura is not great, I'm just purely commenting on Sasuke. \n\nShikamaru and Shikadai don't deserve what they're getting for sure. If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Choji and his bitch have no screen time but seem to be in a positive relationship and inosai is a normal and typical relationship and is actually super wholesome when you consider how the characters originally were, to how they are now.

If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

If it were real life, I would tell them to gtfo and for Shikamaru to file for divorce, lol.\n\nAll I was saying is that Sakura could probably reason with Temari to some degree, but was also trying to make a joke that Temari could probably get Sakura to reassess her self-worth a bit when it comes to men. \n\nI'm sad Temari was turned into such a useless PoS.

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

Choji and his bitch have no screen time but seem to be in a positive relationship and inosai is a normal and typical relationship and is actually super wholesome when you consider how the characters originally were, to how they are now.

Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",

            "body": "Ye temari was considered by most to be the best waifu of Naruto. She sucks dick now. Like she's not bad all the time, but a good chunk of the time she sucks. \n\nAnd Sasuke actually can't do anything to support Sakura or be a good husband since he legally has to go on missions going after any remains of otsosuki or kaguya. That's the only reason he's not in jail. He's serving his sentence for his crimes, similar to how orochimaru is serving his. Sasuke has to go after any remains of kaguya and zetsu, and get rid of them. And he also has to check in with the hokage and Naruto and report what he's found on his missions. Also, his life is in Narutos hands, and if he does anything out of line, Naruto will have to kill him personally. That's the sentence tsunade gave him and was the only alternative to being locked up for life or being killed, which was what the raikage wanted. And it had to come with kakashi vouching for him, and Naruto assuring them he'd take care of Sasuke. And I think its stated in the final time skip of shipuden when Kakashi is hokage, or it might have been in the light novels, that if Kakashi wasn't hokage, Sasuke would've likely been dead. And if tsunade wasn't hokage before him when Sasuke went rouge, then he would've been a rouge shinobi and would've been hunted and killed. So I give Sasuke a pass since he legally can't. I still don't really like Sasuke or Sakura though (although boruto improved sakuras character) and sakuras love for Sasuke makes no sense and the ship sucks. \n\nIts my personal belief that the perfect end to Sasukes character arc would've been with him ending up alone and nomadic, living his best life. Being sorta like jiraiya. Having no children or marriage, and traveling the world hunting down the remains of kaguya. And the perfect end to sakuras character would've been to have her alone as well. Or maybe have her date someone new. An alternative to the end i said for Sasuke would've been for him to truly find a love outside the village and get married and have kids with that person. With the end of shipuden and the Sasuke hiden novels that take place after shipuden but before boruto, building up a relationship for Sasuke.",
