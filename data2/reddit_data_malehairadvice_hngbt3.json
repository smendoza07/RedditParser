Not because it looks bad but because they have no destination in mind. You wouldn't take a trip without a place to head towards. It is the same with your hair. With clear destination you can deal with any obstacles but if you are not clear the first sign of difficulty you will cut it off.",

Some of them are certainly capable and would give you a great haircut; but a proper stylist, like someone who regularly is doing scissor-only cuts or layers for long-haired women should be able to shape your cut while letting it grow. You should be able to still get a cut once every few months as it's continuing to grow to give it _more_ body and shape and volume, etc.\n\nBreak out of the paradigm that you either have to get a cut to go shorter or do nothing. There is a third option.\n\nEdit: Reading through some of your other replies it looks like you're already doing this. Fantastic!",
