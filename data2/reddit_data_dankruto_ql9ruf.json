Whilst kakashi rejected it because HE didn\u2019t feel it was right. That\u2019s why I say he was never good. And he never did at the end of the wave arc he just became the lesser evil when he accepted the fact that Haku was important to him. My point is he wasn\u2019t forced he chose to become bad for a good cause that doesn\u2019t make you good it makes you the lesser evil. Like itachi. Your actions are what define you after all",

I always thought I hated non-binary people because they want to feel special so instead of picking a side, they decide to be the super special class not in the rulebook that gets all the advantages and none of the weaknesses of any if the others. \n\nBut reading this, by definition this would make Orochimaru non-binary. And that really doesn't bother me one bit. It just makes sense that if you don't care, you don't bother. I wouldn't have problems with pronouns or anything either, because it's just not that big a deal.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that it's not non-binary people I have a problem with, but people who are loud and obnoxious, which would be the only ones I'd hear since quiet non-binary people aren't heard because they'd be quiet.

They did that whole trope they introduced in part 1 where two ninja who are close enough and at a high enough level don't need words because they can literally communicate through fighting.

He even recognized he felt the same way towards naruto early on, that it pained him too.   \n\n\nThe talk with Nagato is an example of this too. Where Nagato was testing if Naruto would attack him in hatred, regardless of whether he would win or lose, but Naruto actually chose to not fight, even though he was shaking with anger. Instead he chose to ask about why Nagato thought like he did.",

But Naruto did in fact beat the shit out of him vicariously through the Pains beforehand meaning that he did in fact catch the hands first. Which only further proves my point that Naruto throws hands first and does Talk No Jutsu after. And Sasuke only physically spoke to Naruto heart to heart after he literally had an arm blown off during the fight with Naruto, during which Naruto absolutely rocked his shit (and got his shit rocked in return, but that invalidates nothing. The point is that they communicated with their fists first and talked later). You can't really disagree with what visibly happens right there, Naruto does absolutely beat people TF up first and then speech at them later. Sasuke wasn't willing to listen and hear Naruto out until he literally had zero other options left and was bleeding out on the ground next to him.",

Naruto wanted to know what Sasuke's goals were and why he was doing what he was doing. Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",

I always thought I hated non-binary people because they want to feel special so instead of picking a side, they decide to be the super special class not in the rulebook that gets all the advantages and none of the weaknesses of any if the others. \n\nBut reading this, by definition this would make Orochimaru non-binary. And that really doesn't bother me one bit. It just makes sense that if you don't care, you don't bother. I wouldn't have problems with pronouns or anything either, because it's just not that big a deal.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that it's not non-binary people I have a problem with, but people who are loud and obnoxious, which would be the only ones I'd hear since quiet non-binary people aren't heard because they'd be quiet.

He even recognized he felt the same way towards naruto early on, that it pained him too.   \n\n\nThe talk with Nagato is an example of this too. Where Nagato was testing if Naruto would attack him in hatred, regardless of whether he would win or lose, but Naruto actually chose to not fight, even though he was shaking with anger.

But Naruto did in fact beat the shit out of him vicariously through the Pains beforehand meaning that he did in fact catch the hands first.

And Sasuke only physically spoke to Naruto heart to heart after he literally had an arm blown off during the fight with Naruto, during which Naruto absolutely rocked his shit (and got his shit rocked in return, but that invalidates nothing. The point is that they communicated with their fists first and talked later). You can't really disagree with what visibly happens right there, Naruto does absolutely beat people TF up first and then speech at them later. Sasuke wasn't willing to listen and hear Naruto out until he literally had zero other options left and was bleeding out on the ground next to him.",

Naruto wanted to know what Sasuke's goals were and why he was doing what he was doing. Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",

I always thought I hated non-binary people because they want to feel special so instead of picking a side, they decide to be the super special class not in the rulebook that gets all the advantages and none of the weaknesses of any if the others. \n\nBut reading this, by definition this would make Orochimaru non-binary. And that really doesn't bother me one bit. It just makes sense that if you don't care, you don't bother. I wouldn't have problems with pronouns or anything either, because it's just not that big a deal.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that it's not non-binary people I have a problem with, but people who are loud and obnoxious, which would be the only ones I'd hear since quiet non-binary people aren't heard because they'd be quiet.

He even recognized he felt the same way towards naruto early on, that it pained him too.   \n\n\nThe talk with Nagato is an example of this too. Where Nagato was testing if Naruto would attack him in hatred, regardless of whether he would win or lose, but Naruto actually chose to not fight, even though he was shaking with anger. Instead he chose to ask about why Nagato thought like he did.",

But Naruto did in fact beat the shit out of him vicariously through the Pains beforehand meaning that he did in fact catch the hands first. Which only further proves my point that Naruto throws hands first and does Talk No Jutsu after. And Sasuke only physically spoke to Naruto heart to heart after he literally had an arm blown off during the fight with Naruto, during which Naruto absolutely rocked his shit (and got his shit rocked in return, but that invalidates nothing. The point is that they communicated with their fists first and talked later). You can't really disagree with what visibly happens right there, Naruto does absolutely beat people TF up first and then speech at them later. Sasuke wasn't willing to listen and hear Naruto out until he literally had zero other options left and was bleeding out on the ground next to him.",

Naruto wanted to know what Sasuke's goals were and why he was doing what he was doing. Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",

And that really doesn't bother me one bit. It just makes sense that if you don't care, you don't bother. I wouldn't have problems with pronouns or anything either, because it's just not that big a deal.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that it's not non-binary people I have a problem with, but people who are loud and obnoxious, which would be the only ones I'd hear since quiet non-binary people aren't heard because they'd be quiet.

If I had to take my guess, I'd say only kakashi would've tried to decipher what he said due to shared history.",

Naruto literally had to lose Jiraiya and experience hatred and loneliness to even UNDERSTAND sasuke, which is a big part of why Sasuke is willing to even acknowledge Naruto and hear him out. Also, Sasuke literally asked \"What if I stand against you again\", and Naruto said sasuke wouldn't do that again, because he now properly understood the empathy naruto felt towards him. He even recognized he felt the same way towards naruto early on, that it pained him too.   \n\n\nThe talk with Nagato is an example of this too. Where Nagato was testing if Naruto would attack him in hatred, regardless of whether he would win or lose, but Naruto actually chose to not fight, even though he was shaking with anger. Instead he chose to ask about why Nagato thought like he did.",

But Naruto did in fact beat the shit out of him vicariously through the Pains beforehand meaning that he did in fact catch the hands first. Which only further proves my point that Naruto throws hands first and does Talk No Jutsu after. And Sasuke only physically spoke to Naruto heart to heart after he literally had an arm blown off during the fight with Naruto, during which Naruto absolutely rocked his shit (and got his shit rocked in return, but that invalidates nothing. The point is that they communicated with their fists first and talked later). You can't really disagree with what visibly happens right there, Naruto does absolutely beat people TF up first and then speech at them later. Sasuke wasn't willing to listen and hear Naruto out until he literally had zero other options left and was bleeding out on the ground next to him.",

Naruto wanted to know what Sasuke's goals were and why he was doing what he was doing. Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",

Who gaara was before was what the village made him into. Gaara lost the one person who could've turned him around. Naruto had Iruka, if he didn't he would've most likely ended up like gaara.",

And that really doesn't bother me one bit. It just makes sense that if you don't care, you don't bother. I wouldn't have problems with pronouns or anything either, because it's just not that big a deal.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that it's not non-binary people I have a problem with, but people who are loud and obnoxious, which would be the only ones I'd hear since quiet non-binary people aren't heard because they'd be quiet.

But Naruto did in fact beat the shit out of him vicariously through the Pains beforehand meaning that he did in fact catch the hands first. Which only further proves my point that Naruto throws hands first and does Talk No Jutsu after. And Sasuke only physically spoke to Naruto heart to heart after he literally had an arm blown off during the fight with Naruto, during which Naruto absolutely rocked his shit (and got his shit rocked in return, but that invalidates nothing. The point is that they communicated with their fists first and talked later). You can't really disagree with what visibly happens right there, Naruto does absolutely beat people TF up first and then speech at them later. Sasuke wasn't willing to listen and hear Naruto out until he literally had zero other options left and was bleeding out on the ground next to him.",

Naruto wanted to know what Sasuke's goals were and why he was doing what he was doing. Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",

I always thought I hated non-binary people because they want to feel special so instead of picking a side, they decide to be the super special class not in the rulebook that gets all the advantages and none of the weaknesses of any if the others. \n\nBut reading this, by definition this would make Orochimaru non-binary. And that really doesn't bother me one bit. It just makes sense that if you don't care, you don't bother. I wouldn't have problems with pronouns or anything either, because it's just not that big a deal.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that it's not non-binary people I have a problem with, but people who are loud and obnoxious, which would be the only ones I'd hear since quiet non-binary people aren't heard because they'd be quiet.

Naruto wanted to know what Sasuke's goals were and why he was doing what he was doing. Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",

Sasuke answered. Naruto refused to let him. Sasuke then essentially responded, \"cool, I don't care about your opinion and I'll kill you and anyone else in my way to get what I want.\" And Naruto essentially said \"yea that ain't gonna happen, time to beat some sense into you\"\n\nTheir talking *during* the fight was even less substantial. It was more or less just yelling at each other like a couple arguing. They're both saying shit, but neither of them listened or acted towards a resolution based on what they heard. Sasuke stubbornly continued, which is why they *had* to fight. Proving my point that Sasuke had to catch the hands and be left with literally no other options he could physically accomplish, bleeding out on the ground next to Naruto in order to finally stop and listen, and converse productively. Naruto beat the snot out of him, then convinced him after.\n\nAlso, as an aside, plenty of conversation between them was had more or less telepathically. Again, they introduced the trope back in part one where Sasuke literally told Naruto verbally that there's no more point in talking because strong enough Shinobi can speak through combat. That is literally what happened between them again in the final fight, plenty of times they were not out loud verbally speaking but still heard each other loud and clear and we as the audience also heard their thoughts. Meaning, exactly like I said before, Sasuke got Talk No Jutsu'd through the beatdown Naruto gave him.\n\nI'm not saying Talk No Jutsu doesn't exist or was never once used on the people I named. I specifically said they were targeted by it, more than once. It didn't work immediately, Naruto had to kick the shit out of them first.",
