The only special things about the SK are: 1) it is invisible until it touches you, 2) the jutsu kills you, and 3) it serves as a gate to another dimension where souls can be sealed. But invisibility isn't that weird in a world where genjutsu exists, just look at the 2nd Mizukage's giant genjutsu clam summon. And plenty of things can seal souls in pocket dimensions in Naruto: like 2 of the Six Path Sage Tools and the Totsuka Blade. And several other jutsu also kill their users, like Hidan's ritual (assuming the user is mortal) and the Rinne Rebirth technique.",

Whether it's because it's essentially a jutsu that grants him the killed people's life essence or it's the sacrifice he makes to the Lord Jashin, whatever he was doing, stopped. So his immortality should run out and then his life.\n\nThere are some episodes in Boruto that delve into this. It's an adaptation of the novel \"Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls\", and they follow Guy, Kakashi and Asuma's daughter Mirai Sarutobi. It's pretty good, and there was a manga version of the novel announced recently as well.",

I don't think he was just looking for \"immortality\" per se, but a way to become insanely strong. And he was on the right path by choosing the sharingan as the main point of this search, since it was connected to the sage of the six paths, which in turn is connected to the otsutsuki and all their overpowered strengths.\n\nEven the curse mark that he developed in itself is just an unevolved version of the karma in the boruto anime (even if it all technically started from jugo). It still gives its users a huge power boost and when activated has similar mannerisms to the karma (spreads over the body, has that orange inking to it when it activates etc).",

The only special things about the SK are: 1) it is invisible until it touches you, 2) the jutsu kills you, and 3) it serves as a gate to another dimension where souls can be sealed. But invisibility isn't that weird in a world where genjutsu exists, just look at the 2nd Mizukage's giant genjutsu clam summon. And plenty of things can seal souls in pocket dimensions in Naruto: like 2 of the Six Path Sage Tools and the Totsuka Blade.

So his immortality should run out and then his life.\n\nThere are some episodes in Boruto that delve into this. It's an adaptation of the novel \"Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls\", and they follow Guy, Kakashi and Asuma's daughter Mirai Sarutobi. It's pretty good, and there was a manga version of the novel announced recently as well.",

The only special things about the SK are: 1) it is invisible until it touches you, 2) the jutsu kills you, and 3) it serves as a gate to another dimension where souls can be sealed. But invisibility isn't that weird in a world where genjutsu exists, just look at the 2nd Mizukage's giant genjutsu clam summon. And plenty of things can seal souls in pocket dimensions in Naruto: like 2 of the Six Path Sage Tools and the Totsuka Blade. And several other jutsu also kill their users, like Hidan's ritual (assuming the user is mortal) and the Rinne Rebirth technique.",

Whether it's because it's essentially a jutsu that grants him the killed people's life essence or it's the sacrifice he makes to the Lord Jashin, whatever he was doing, stopped. So his immortality should run out and then his life.\n\nThere are some episodes in Boruto that delve into this. It's an adaptation of the novel \"Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls\", and they follow Guy, Kakashi and Asuma's daughter Mirai Sarutobi. It's pretty good, and there was a manga version of the novel announced recently as well.",

It wasn\u2019t an immediate conversion for Gaara. It was tasteful and meaningful.

There\u2019s already an in universe explanation for his transformation and powers just like there\u2019s an in universe explanation for the Akimichi clans ability to change their size! There\u2019s no in universe explanation saying that they can use their body expansion technique to expand objects too. I think if they could, choji would expand his food! Idk if that makes sense but that\u2019s how I personally look at it",
