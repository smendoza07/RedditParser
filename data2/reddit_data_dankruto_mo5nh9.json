And to nr 5: I wasnt talking about naruto as a character but about Naruto as a show. Sasuke probably should have died a dozen times, everybody gets ridiculous wounds and survives then you have neji who lost to a wood stick.

Not to bash on Iruka\u2019s character, but you have to take it with a grain of salt that Iruka is not credible since he\u2019s only seen Hiruzen in action. Iruka was too young to be a ninja when Minato was only a Jounin, and was unable to actually witness Minato stop the Kyuubi. Even more salt needs to be taken when you consider the fact that he\u2019s talking to the man\u2019s grandson. \n\nIf Madara states that none of the Kage are as strong as Hashirama, then it\u2019s true because Madara has experience fighting them both. \n\nIf the ramen guy states that Kakashi can take on Itachi, it\u2019s most definitely not true. \n\nDon\u2019t bash a Shonen for having Shonen qualities then? Sasuke is a protagonist and former antagonist so obviously he has plot armor. Don\u2019t compare plot armors of main characters and side characters.",

            "body": "Yes you're right about the first 2 points I got it mixed up but to point 3 and 4: In the manga it was said by Iruka to Konohamaru that he was the strongest Hokage of them all. Not of all Kages. You can look it up on every wiki page about him or something like chapter 100 or so from the original naruto manga. And to nr 5: I wasnt talking about naruto as a character but about Naruto as a show. Sasuke probably should have died a dozen times, everybody gets ridiculous wounds and survives then you have neji who lost to a wood stick. I grew up with naruto but its such an inconsistent and sometimes inferior show compared to other shonens.",
