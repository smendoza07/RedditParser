And there were reports that YHM ALLEGEDLY cheated on her to date Baek Jin-Hee. Therefore a possible reason on why Somin personally sympathises so much to cheating issues.\n\nHope you find someone ur true love soon, Somin!",

I don't remember) where he said \"It's a love that will never be\" which is really weirdly worded just to say \"I don't see her that way\".\n\nThough to be fair, that was 3 months ago.",

Somin did say in MUD \"I'll think about it\" which is code for \"I don't see you that way\", while Sechan said in one episode (was it with Rowoon? I don't remember) where he said \"It's a love that will never be\" which is really weirdly worded just to say \"I don't see her that way\".\n\nThough to be fair, that was 3 months ago.",
