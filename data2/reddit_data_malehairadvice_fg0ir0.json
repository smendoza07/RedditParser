First of all his looks more swept back while yours looks mostly swept to the side (and maybe you style it while it's a little damp?), which makes it look a bit flat on top. Start by towel-drying it a bit, then blow dry it (on warm from a distance) to the side and back (might help to turn your head upside-down) until its pretty much dry and kinda sticking up a little on its own, then use american crew forming cream to sweep it to the side and back. I've switched between that and layrite super hold wax, but honestly am kinda falling back in love with the forming cream for its ability to make your hair look a little wavy even when it's really not.\n\nYou could also experiment with trying the [curly girl beginner method](https://i.imgur.com/FA7kPST.png). I would just focus on 1) clarifying shampoo to start, then 2) switch completely away from shampoo with sulfates/silicones to washing with the conditioner they recommend. Might help your hair get a little more wavy / lift. Ignore the advice about using mousse or gel, doesn't really work for non-curly hair IMO. \n\nAnd come back and show us how it works!",

I'm currently cutting, it's been going good. I'm 5'7, I'm around \\~168 lbs, I was at 175lbs and I'm going to 155-160lbs. Interestingly, my upper body is decent but I hold most of my muscle and fat in my legs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did a bf test a few months ago when I was 171, and I was 13.9%. My jawline is not bad when I flex it. The main reason I stayed at a higher bf is because I wanted size, mainly for the off chance I get into a fight - which is so stupid. I mean I'm not looking for fights but I guess I'm insecure, and it's in the back of my head. I always wanted to be lower bf.\n\nOnce I cut down I am going to stay down.",

First of all his looks more swept back while yours looks mostly swept to the side (and maybe you style it while it's a little damp?), which makes it look a bit flat on top. Start by towel-drying it a bit, then blow dry it (on warm from a distance) to the side and back (might help to turn your head upside-down) until its pretty much dry and kinda sticking up a little on its own, then use american crew forming cream to sweep it to the side and back. I've switched between that and layrite super hold wax, but honestly am kinda falling back in love with the forming cream for its ability to make your hair look a little wavy even when it's really not.\n\nYou could also experiment with trying the [curly girl beginner method](https://i.imgur.com/FA7kPST.png). I would just focus on 1) clarifying shampoo to start, then 2) switch completely away from shampoo with sulfates/silicones to washing with the conditioner they recommend. Might help your hair get a little more wavy / lift. Ignore the advice about using mousse or gel, doesn't really work for non-curly hair IMO. \n\nAnd come back and show us how it works!",

My jawline is not bad when I flex it. The main reason I stayed at a higher bf is because I wanted size, mainly for the off chance I get into a fight - which is so stupid. I mean I'm not looking for fights but I guess I'm insecure, and it's in the back of my head. I always wanted to be lower bf.\n\nOnce I cut down I am going to stay down.",
