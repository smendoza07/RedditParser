    "body": "I spent the last two hours sorting all posts by \"Top (All Time)\" then scrolling down and removing all inappropriate posts (anything with the word sexy, anything too revealing or suggestive, any kiss scenes) and comments. I also permanently banned anyone who had posted or commented anything inappropriate.\n\nI was invited to moderate r/jeonsomin by another mod during the height of the pandemic (2 years ago), when it was a very small subreddit (averaging 1-3 posts a month). I soon became very busy trying to maintain good grades and applying to colleges, so I stopped visiting that subreddit completely, assuming that it would stay small and relatively unpopular.  **I was appalled to see the inappropriate and disgusting content that was posted/commented while I was gone, and I apologize to Jeon Somin and Running Man fans for neglecting my job as a moderator.**\n\nThank you to the users who brought this issue to my attention, and I promise to keep r/jeonsomin  SFW and wholesome from now on. **To anyone who has left the subreddit, I seriously hope you reconsider rejoining and to everyone, I encourage you to post more wholesome Jeon Somin content there to keep the subreddit alive! :)** Also, if anyone wants to apply to become a moderator for r/jeonsomin, please message me and I'd be happy to make you a moderator.\n\nEdit: I made some minor edits in the first paragraph, just reworded some sentences.",
