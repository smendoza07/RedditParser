You can't tell me that Danzo, who went around collecting orphans for his private army, didn't notice dozens of children going missing or that he wasn't interested in producing kids with mokuton for his own use. He was probably one of Oro's suppliers. He jumped all over baby Yamato right from the start and raised him in secret, hidden from Hiruzen. \n\nDanzo also straight up orchestrated the genocide of a founding clan. I kinda get the sense that we never saw the full depth of some of his atrocities up close the way we did with Orochimaru.",

He summoned two meteors literally just to check out the rinnegan.\n\nThough Akatsuki were underwhelming. Kishi overhyped them by first showing members who were a lot stronger than almost any other Akatsuki member, instead of making them average in strength. Like it was weird that Sasori only made a ninja puppet of himself and third kazekage. Imagine if he was hunting down strong shinobi with kekkei genkai to make a puppet of them and then fight. Imagine Particle Release puppet",

I just think it got too caught up in awesome action that it forgot atmosphere and tone. For example Naruto having geart attack in the snowy night was some of the best anime ever. Its real. Dude is carrying all the hatred and pain on his shoulder. Ofc he is gonna get stressed out. Him being speechless vs Nagato was also amazing. Thats why i liked Oro and Pain scenes.

By \"killing \" sarutobi he was destroying the most reliable pillar of the shinobi world. The one who had always strived for some uneasy peace - however imperfect - at all costs. He failed because sarutobi's ideals flawed as they are, were noble enough to generate a large enough following amongst the leaf to transcend him.\n\nLater in shippuden orochimaru confessed he saw himself as a great wind that would generate change throughout the shinobi world. This onslaught against Konoha was him trying to end the organization that had ensured the shinobi world established by Hashirama Senju would never change. And no living ninja at the time embodied Hashirama's ideals more frustratingly from Oro's perspective than Hiruzen Sarutobi",

He was probably one of Oro's suppliers. He jumped all over baby Yamato right from the start and raised him in secret, hidden from Hiruzen. \n\nDanzo also straight up orchestrated the genocide of a founding clan. I kinda get the sense that we never saw the full depth of some of his atrocities up close the way we did with Orochimaru.",

He was probably one of Oro's suppliers. He jumped all over baby Yamato right from the start and raised him in secret, hidden from Hiruzen. \n\nDanzo also straight up orchestrated the genocide of a founding clan.
