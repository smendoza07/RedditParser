Sasuke inherently was never evil, he was twisted all the time, Orochimaru exploited him at the worst time possible and twisted him, Itachi basically destroyed him twice and Danzo fucked over the whole clan. Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

He wanted to make him strong and independent but he made the worst decisions possible . However we cannot blame him completely cause imo Itachi's life was the hardest and most painful in the whole Narutoverse . Itachi did realized his mistakes at the end and believed in Naruto to bring Sasuke back . I do sympathize with Sasuke but I dont think I will ever be able to like his character . I dont like him in Boruto either though his abilities are really cool",

Sasuke inherently was never evil, he was twisted all the time, Orochimaru exploited him at the worst time possible and twisted him, Itachi basically destroyed him twice and Danzo fucked over the whole clan. Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

Imo Naruto had it worse than Sasuke in some ways . Sasuke had lost all his family but he still was treated well in the village unlike Naruto who was treated like shit by everyone .",

Itachi and Danzo should be blamed for half of what Sasuke did but he should be blamed for the other half . Itachi was right in always calling Sasuke a foolish little brother cause he was really foolish . If not for Naruto he would have become an ever worse Madara .",

Sasuke inherently was never evil, he was twisted all the time, Orochimaru exploited him at the worst time possible and twisted him, Itachi basically destroyed him twice and Danzo fucked over the whole clan. Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

He wanted to make him strong and independent but he made the worst decisions possible . However we cannot blame him completely cause imo Itachi's life was the hardest and most painful in the whole Narutoverse . Itachi did realized his mistakes at the end and believed in Naruto to bring Sasuke back . I do sympathize with Sasuke but I dont think I will ever be able to like his character . I dont like him in Boruto either though his abilities are really cool",

Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

He saw people die when he was so young , matured really early because of the trauma war caused him , his father expected too much of him , he had to kill his own parents at a very young age , he had to abandon his brother whom he loved the most , he had to live with dangerous people all the time as a spy . In short , he was never able to find true peace . Though Sasuke and Naruto went through a lot too atleast now they have a loving and caring family and are leading a happy life (despite being overloaded with their work ) but Itachi never got to live a life like this .",

Sasuke inherently was never evil, he was twisted all the time, Orochimaru exploited him at the worst time possible and twisted him, Itachi basically destroyed him twice and Danzo fucked over the whole clan. Sasuke was foolish yes but he was exposed to twisted machinations very very young, he wasn't even out of the academy, also take note that Sasuke's father was also a bit of an asshole to him, if he showed the slightest of emotion to him he would've been better. Sasuke was always dependant on others, tried to be independent but his view was twisted and was definietly unhealthy. He would've been worse than Madara yes but thankfully that never happened.",

Itachi did realized his mistakes at the end and believed in Naruto to bring Sasuke back . I do sympathize with Sasuke but I dont think I will ever be able to like his character .

He wanted to make him strong and independent but he made the worst decisions possible . However we cannot blame him completely cause imo Itachi's life was the hardest and most painful in the whole Narutoverse . Itachi did realized his mistakes at the end and believed in Naruto to bring Sasuke back . I do sympathize with Sasuke but I dont think I will ever be able to like his character . I dont like him in Boruto either though his abilities are really cool",
