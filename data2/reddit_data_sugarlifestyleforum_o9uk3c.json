    "body": "I started sugaring just over 2 years ago after my divorce to pay off debt my ex put me in. At first I wasn\u2019t very disciplined and spent most of my ppms. 8 months ago I met my current SD and everything changed. I had motivation to work harder and better my life. He helped me get out of debt, and due to some other life events I was able to get a new car. Then I got a better job with room for growth. I thought, well, my goal is achieved what now? I really care for my SD and I value our relationship, I didn\u2019t want to just end things. \n  Last month we went on vacation and we talked about me going back to school to finish my associates degree. I am only a few classes away from being done, but 2 of those classes are math and I have put it off for 11 years because I hate math so much. But now I\u2019m older, more responsible, and ready to take on the challenge. He agreed to pay and today he sent me the money to pay my fall tuition! He said he might not be able to buy me as many gifts, but I told him a degree is the best gift I could ever ask for. \n  I am only taking one class to begin with since it\u2019s been so long that I\u2019ve been in math, and this is a 6 credit course. I cannot believe how lucky I am! While our relationship started as an arrangement, it has definitely shifted more towards a regular relationship. Well, as regular as we can be. I see a lot of negativity on here and I just want to remind everyone that good SDs and good SBs exist. Good arrangements exist. That\u2019s all \u263a\ufe0f",
