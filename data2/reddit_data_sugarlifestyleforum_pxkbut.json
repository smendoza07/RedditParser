    "body": "I\u2019ve seen a wide variety of super sexual to super modest. Girls with their friends (this seems to be becoming more common), virgins, girls that are very pregnant or have very unusual preferences.\n\nBut the one I still think about is a girl in her early 20\u2019s in a wheelchair with MS. Her profile was fun and flirty. She talked a bit about what it would be like to date her snd the practical issues of her MS in a very upbeat and direct way. Then ended her profile with, \u201cand just in case you were wondering, yes I still like to fuck.\u201d\n\nThat girl is a legend. Here we are worrying about our own insecurities and she is out there getting her groove on and getting and allowance while she is at it.",
