    "body": "Please please and please stop posting your profiles for review on this sub because no matter how gorgeous you look, how beautiful your pictures are or how well spoken amd educated you sound you\u2019ll still get ripped to shreds while Becky can post the same three pictures wearing black leggings and a crop top and these men will be all \u201cgoddess\u201d \u2018omg you\u2019re so beautiful\u2019 \nA black woman posts a bikini picture and and she\u2019s called a \u2018pro\u2019 or a gold digger which is really rich Viking from men in this sub but 4 days ago this white girl literally had her butt crack on display and no one batted an eyelid.\n\nEven though the rules of the sub say not to you\u2019ll still have these men commenting on your appearance and telling you how average you look or telling you you\u2019re overweight. You don\u2019t need that kind of negativity in your life so please just don\u2019t. Ask a fellow black sugar baby what you need to do but don\u2019t ask these racist trolls.

            "body": "Im.going to repost what I shared here a week ago. I'm not gonna lie - even I look at some of fellow AA SBs profile reviews and think \"wtf\"??? I end up not even offering advice because even - as a WOC - I don't have much positive to say! Education be damned, actual text portion can be on point, and they hit every single line item that would make a perfect post. But their pictures....leaves me wondering where the self awareness is. Dont get me wrong, a lot of profiles that get posted here by all nationalities have me questioning  their common sense, and i treat them the same way. I'm sorry, but we can't uplift each other unless we are HONEST with each other. And being honest, some of our sistas need to really take a step back and rethink joining the bowl. The same look that catches the brothas attention on the street - is NOT necessarily going to turn a white high end exec from the Midwest's head...and getting offended by that confuses me.\n\n**********************************************************\nAs an AA (mixed) SB - I gotta keep it real with my sistas that join the bowl....\n\n\n1. People have preferences...and there is nothing wrong with that. All of us have them! I am not attracted to obese men, some women only like tall guys, some men don't care for flat chested/small boobs, and some people just aren't attracted to other ethnicities. Gotta learn to be OK with that. Peoples preferences are based on their environment. Personally speaking, I'm open to all ethnicities- as long as I am attracted to them!!!! And Hell yeah I'd date a Travis Kelce over a Sheldon Cooper anyday...\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0d. But someone preferring a certain type is not racism - and I find a lot of AA women confuse the 2.\n\n\n\n2. There is a caveat though - and this tends to hurt people's feelings (and I understand): there are men who have said to my face \"I'm not into black girls, normally\"...but then WILL openly want to date or be involved with me?! \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab. Yes, ive even had AA men say that. What they really are saying is they like black girls that have lighter complexions...(Saweetie, DojaCat, Beyonce, Ashanti, etc) - those that are considered \"racially ambiguous\" but identify as AA women. I can't lie and say I haven't benefited from being mixed and having a Lite complexion...and then my gf who is a beautiful chocolate complexion hardly gets any matches, or she gets the \"you are pretty - for a dark girl, but im not into black women\" backhanded compliments \ud83d\ude44. This woman is beautiful and built like a real life sex doll - but she doesn't even get a lot of \"play\" in vanilla dating...so in the bowl, those chances get even lower. It is the sad reality for AA women both in vanilla and the sugar lifestyle....\n\n\n3. My SDs have been all pretty respectful, but I've met some POTs who really acted like I was more of a \"live doll\" then a human being. They would make creepy comments \"I didn't know black girls were so soft\"....\"what ARE you mixed with, because you look so exotic\"...\"how did you get your hair so curly - can I touch it?\" (Water bruh...thats it...amazing right - WATER). LOL\n\n\n4. Lastly - the more \"standard\" beauty you have the better your chances are. For example- I used to be part of this SB group in my city. I stood out like a sore thumb!!!! These chick's had 4\" coffin nails with gems and chains on them, all colors of wigs, amiclubwear type outfits...false lashes longer then their natural hair....and only 4 out of the 15 girls there - had an SD. Every single one was complaining about how SA sucked, no one msg them, no one responded, etc. Now - if that is their style of dress, cool - they like it I love it. BUT...if going for the C-level exec type SD, YOU have to look the part! Not saying go get named brand high end clothes...no....but you have to be what you want to attract. And for us black girls that sometimes means changing our methods...where other ethnicities may not have to\n\n\nTake breaks in this bowl. If you don't, you will burn out trying to constantly find a POT. Keep a solid circle of friends - it is so important to be around people that value you for YOU. Be careful of the \"you are so exotic\" type who fetishize you solely because you are black. And don't let anyone's not choosing you be a reason for YOU to give up...",

I posted a profile review and have also asked SDs from the thread to review my profile and what you described has never been my experience. With that being said, as a black SB, you will have to work 2-3x as hard as any other SB who is non-black because that is the way of the world. You have to do this at school, at work, etc. I just say if you can't take the heat, then stay out the kitchen. This style of dating is nuanced and you need thick skin to do it. Not everyone is going to find you attractive. It's okay. Shake it off, keep it moving, and get your bag, sis. Ignore the naysayers.",

We all have preconceived notions about others that happen to affect how we choose POTs. And it seems that the poster-girl of all SBs happens to be a white sorority-girl type. That might not be what everyone is looking for, but I think that\u2019s the common perception of what an SB is (I mean FFS, just look at how sites like SA advertise their members + target demographics). \n\nSome SDs shy away from Black SBs because they believe we\u2019re ghetto, unkempt/trashy, and only in it for the money. Obviously that\u2019s a stereotype and doesn\u2019t represent everyone, but it\u2019s an obstacle we have to accept in order to overcome it. Blaming it on racism and saying that all SDs need to do better isn\u2019t productive because it\u2019s not going to change anything. Instead, find little ways to prove them wrong and show that Black SBs can be just as good as any other SB. \n\nFWIW, I judge all profile reviews evenly despite race. Perks of being a mixed girl I guess \ud83d\ude05. Though Black SBs have to be more aware of the negative stereotypes that are stacked against them in the bowl. Pointing out aspects of their profile that might play into them and how to avoid that is, IMO, an important piece of feedback that\u2019ll help us challenge unfair stereotypes in the long run.",

The content of profiles from black women on SA are wrong for the demographic (white old men).   When black women post their profiles here, of course they're going to get harsh feedback.  Most of the profiles are simply not \"white\" enough. From personal experience, the vast majority of black women profiles have Miami, Las Vegas, and gold digger vibes.  The ones that have more normative pics and descriptions will do better.\n\nI'm a POC and young and vanilla dated black women.  So i don't think i'm saying this from a lens of racism.  Black SBs need to realize that sexy and attractive in the black community is just simply not the same for the old and white community.  It's not that the black women aren't attractive, but their portrayal of themselves don't vibe with what old white men want as their fantasy.\n\nOne anecdotal detail, i see white men with black SBs in the wild all the time in NY",

That might not be what everyone is looking for, but I think that\u2019s the common perception of what an SB is (I mean FFS, just look at how sites like SA advertise their members + target demographics). \n\nSome SDs shy away from Black SBs because they believe we\u2019re ghetto, unkempt/trashy, and only in it for the money. Obviously that\u2019s a stereotype and doesn\u2019t represent everyone, but it\u2019s an obstacle we have to accept in order to overcome it. Blaming it on racism and saying that all SDs need to do better isn\u2019t productive because it\u2019s not going to change anything. Instead, find little ways to prove them wrong and show that Black SBs can be just as good as any other SB. \n\nFWIW, I judge all profile reviews evenly despite race. Perks of being a mixed girl I guess \ud83d\ude05. Though Black SBs have to be more aware of the negative stereotypes that are stacked against them in the bowl. Pointing out aspects of their profile that might play into them and how to avoid that is, IMO, an important piece of feedback that\u2019ll help us challenge unfair stereotypes in the long run.",

We all have preconceived notions about others that happen to affect how we choose POTs. And it seems that the poster-girl of all SBs happens to be a white sorority-girl type. That might not be what everyone is looking for, but I think that\u2019s the common perception of what an SB is (I mean FFS, just look at how sites like SA advertise their members + target demographics). \n\nSome SDs shy away from Black SBs because they believe we\u2019re ghetto, unkempt/trashy, and only in it for the money. Obviously that\u2019s a stereotype and doesn\u2019t represent everyone, but it\u2019s an obstacle we have to accept in order to overcome it. Blaming it on racism and saying that all SDs need to do better isn\u2019t productive because it\u2019s not going to change anything. Instead, find little ways to prove them wrong and show that Black SBs can be just as good as any other SB. \n\nFWIW, I judge all profile reviews evenly despite race. Perks of being a mixed girl I guess \ud83d\ude05. Though Black SBs have to be more aware of the negative stereotypes that are stacked against them in the bowl. Pointing out aspects of their profile that might play into them and how to avoid that is, IMO, an important piece of feedback that\u2019ll help us challenge unfair stereotypes in the long run.",
