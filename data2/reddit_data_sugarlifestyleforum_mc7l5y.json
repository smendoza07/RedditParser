    "body": "We see various posts daily  where OP asks us \"what if...\", \"How should I handle...\", \"He / she said this, what should I do...\" etc... and everyone and their brother  comes and gives there advice and some pontificate and others debate. The easiest answer is usually \"Just talk to them.\" No two situations are identical, no two SRs are the same. You are an adult, and should be able to speak up for yourself and talk with your partner/ POT. If you dont like something just talk with them. If you are confused, just talk with them. We here at SLF all have different opinions, and thus potentially different answers. We are not you, nor your partner /pot, we don't know every minuscule detail, we are not psychic. Just have a conversation. You may not like the answer your partner gives, but it beats not knowing. \n\nGood luck, and just talk to eachother.",

Yes we all are adults but these relationships are inherently not balanced especially from SB's perspective.  The other analogy would be boss-employee relationship, its not easy to go ask for a raise or point out something your boss is doing wrong even more so for girls who have been conditioned for years to not question the person in authority. You of all people should know when you were new here and in a shitty relationship, everyone told you break it off and move on but you didn't -- I guess having a conversation like an adult doesn't work all the time.",

I'm being a bit arbitrary here with the numbers. My point being that they are adults \"in the eyes of the law\" but in particular have little to no experience on the other side of a negotiation with an adult as old as their parents or grandparents about something as specific as: Will you actually use a condom? Will you actually give me funds after we have sex?  Will you not berate me about not wanting to get into your car with you in a dark parking lot? \n\nYou know - stuff like that.\n\nSo yeah, they want and need some help with this.

If you want better communication try going after someone older if you think you are tough & manly enough to handle seeing stretch marks.\n\nno, but probably 90% of them are.\n\nAge has no correlation with communication, my 19 year old SB was a way better communicator then my 34 year old ex GF. So please dont look down on people for choosing a relationship with someone younger. The term Sugar Daddy has been around 100 years and has always referred to someone who dated and financially cared for a younger woman. \n\nAlso this post isnt about complaining about young SB not being able to communicate, its about telling young SB to just talk to their SD rather than has what should I do.",

Thats why it was always called getting lucky if a guy hooks up with a girl. Women do the choosing.\n\nSugar daddies now have the same privilege that the young beautiful women had while they were growing up. Imagine if you will, now having the ability to chose who you want to sleep with, and having lots of choices. Sugar dating reverses the roles, and puts the man in the position that women have enjoyed most of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately that means given the choice, most guys are going to choose younger, especially if an allowance is going to be involved. Now if you're just looking to date an older wealthy man, im sure many SD would gladly date you. But from what Ive seen only exceptionally beautiful, well kept in shape women that are older end up making it as SB and having successful SR, not just short term arrangments.",

But she still seemed to have issues communicating or trying to spin things in fear \"she would get fired\" or I would dump her if she was 100 pct honest.  Which never would have happened.

So please dont look down on people for choosing a relationship with someone younger. The term Sugar Daddy has been around 100 years and has always referred to someone who dated and financially cared for a younger woman. \n\nAlso this post isnt about complaining about young SB not being able to communicate, its about telling young SB to just talk to their SD rather than has what should I do.",

Thats why it was always called getting lucky if a guy hooks up with a girl. Women do the choosing.\n\nSugar daddies now have the same privilege that the young beautiful women had while they were growing up. Imagine if you will, now having the ability to chose who you want to sleep with, and having lots of choices. Sugar dating reverses the roles, and puts the man in the position that women have enjoyed most of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately that means given the choice, most guys are going to choose younger, especially if an allowance is going to be involved. Now if you're just looking to date an older wealthy man, im sure many SD would gladly date you. But from what Ive seen only exceptionally beautiful, well kept in shape women that are older end up making it as SB and having successful SR, not just short term arrangments.",

Thats why it was always called getting lucky if a guy hooks up with a girl. Women do the choosing.\n\nSugar daddies now have the same privilege that the young beautiful women had while they were growing up. Imagine if you will, now having the ability to chose who you want to sleep with, and having lots of choices. Sugar dating reverses the roles, and puts the man in the position that women have enjoyed most of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately that means given the choice, most guys are going to choose younger, especially if an allowance is going to be involved. Now if you're just looking to date an older wealthy man, im sure many SD would gladly date you. But from what Ive seen only exceptionally beautiful, well kept in shape women that are older end up making it as SB and having successful SR, not just short term arrangments.",

Thats why it was always called getting lucky if a guy hooks up with a girl. Women do the choosing.\n\nSugar daddies now have the same privilege that the young beautiful women had while they were growing up. Imagine if you will, now having the ability to chose who you want to sleep with, and having lots of choices. Sugar dating reverses the roles, and puts the man in the position that women have enjoyed most of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately that means given the choice, most guys are going to choose younger, especially if an allowance is going to be involved. Now if you're just looking to date an older wealthy man, im sure many SD would gladly date you. But from what Ive seen only exceptionally beautiful, well kept in shape women that are older end up making it as SB and having successful SR, not just short term arrangments.",

Thats why it was always called getting lucky if a guy hooks up with a girl. Women do the choosing.\n\nSugar daddies now have the same privilege that the young beautiful women had while they were growing up. Imagine if you will, now having the ability to chose who you want to sleep with, and having lots of choices. Sugar dating reverses the roles, and puts the man in the position that women have enjoyed most of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately that means given the choice, most guys are going to choose younger, especially if an allowance is going to be involved. Now if you're just looking to date an older wealthy man, im sure many SD would gladly date you. But from what Ive seen only exceptionally beautiful, well kept in shape women that are older end up making it as SB and having successful SR, not just short term arrangments.",
