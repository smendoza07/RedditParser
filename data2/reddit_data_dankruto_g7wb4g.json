Imagine a series that expands on what we already know in great detail about the other kage\u2019s, wars, Sannin, tailed beast, and/or Akatsuki among other things. I think Kishimoto and Jump dropped the ball because Naruto has sooooo many good characters, but instead they tried to create all new ones and did so mediocrely. That\u2019s just my opinion tho \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Imagine a series that expands on what we already know in great detail about the other kage\u2019s, wars, Sannin, tailed beast, and/or Akatsuki among other things. I think Kishimoto and Jump dropped the ball because Naruto has sooooo many good characters, but instead they tried to create all new ones and did so mediocrely. That\u2019s just my opinion tho \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
