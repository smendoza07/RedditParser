She\u2019s not a genius like Neji or a complete machine like Lee or Guy, and she\u2019s certainly not as strong as any of them either. She also never really displays any sort of ninjutsu or genjutsu skills of any kind, so she has to find some way to compensate and keep up with her teammates/literally everyone else. \n\nThat\u2019s such an interesting idea that absolutely had the potential to be fleshed out, but fleshing out a supporting character is a sin for Kishi",

She\u2019s not a genius like Neji or a complete machine like Lee or Guy, and she\u2019s certainly not as strong as any of them either. She also never really displays any sort of ninjutsu or genjutsu skills of any kind, so she has to find some way to compensate and keep up with her teammates/literally everyone else. \n\nThat\u2019s such an interesting idea that absolutely had the potential to be fleshed out, but fleshing out a supporting character is a sin for Kishi",
