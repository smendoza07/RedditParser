Yes, it sucks, yes it is depressing. But if you need a listening ear post here or message me. \n\nI am just going to be having some beer and playing Call of Duty and maybe watch old WWII movies centered around winter battles  (Stalingrad, the Battle of the Bulge etc...).\n\nYou guys and gals are not alone!",
