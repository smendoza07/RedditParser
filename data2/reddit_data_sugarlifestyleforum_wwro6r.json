No need to bring it up though if it's too draining or too much to think about/discuss. I would never want anyone to re live any trauma. I'm just wondering what to look out for or keep myself and others safe if someone asks such an invasive question right off the bat and what use it would be to them. I've been asked this but rarely and never from anyone I wasn't super close with. It definitely is one of those things that shouldn't be discussed unless the victim brings it up.",

How does anyone not know about this! Why has this idea never been introduced to the public before?!?! Wait....is THAT what was happening to Marsellus in Pulp Fiction?? I just thought he was getting a really rough massage!!!!\"\n\nAnswering the question with this reply would be the quickest way to label yourself as a sexual predator, in case anyone was wondering! Deflection is considered a sign of guilt in psychology and in the criminal justice system, and when you chime in with this response to a question not even being directed at you... you are not painting yourself in a flattering light. You're basically accusing yourself of something no one ever accused you of in the first place. If you feel like your response was an appropriate reply to a woman hypothetically asking you that question, there are is no way you aren't saying other things that are making women feel unsafe around you. Just something to think about should you ever face trouble retaining SBs or maintaining meaningful relationships with women in general. It's hard enough to make women feel safe as it is, even with other women \ud83d\ude05\n\nIt's like going to a black lives matter protest with an \"all lives matter\" sign. Nobody was saying you were racist beforehand, but feeling the need to chime in and push your own unrelated agenda would lead people to believe you are in fact racist.",

It\u2019s depressing but you would be hard-pressed to find a woman who did not experience any form of SA in her life. You\u2019re probably less likely to encounter women who have been raped but even non-violent SA can be traumatizing. However that does not mean it\u2019s going to interfere with your relationship and the way her date asked her is incredibly rude and dehumanizing. I think it sounds similar to what you would ask a used car salesman about the history of the car you\u2019re interested in or like you are discussing the health of a puppy from a dog breeder; it is inappropriate and it isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s business. There are women who have experienced SA and it won\u2019t interfere with their relationship with you at all; you don\u2019t need to ask such an inappropriate question to gauge compatibility since women are humans and humans are complex beings who are capable of feeling differently about different men and don\u2019t have an \u201cI was assaulted so I\u2019m going to have issues coping with my trauma while with you\u201d button that is toggled. I think a far more effective way of discussing potential problems would be to start out by discussing boundaries and if things go well you can let it naturally progress. I\u2019m guessing in most SR there isn\u2019t going to be a huge gap between meeting and physically intimacy so if a SB is too much for you, you\u2019ll find out quickly. \n\nI understand that you had a girlfriend that struggled because of what she went through and you weren\u2019t having your needs met, but that\u2019s kinda your fault for not discussing boundaries and limits between you two or breaking it off once you realized you were not getting your needs met. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some thing that anyone should have to answer and I wouldn\u2019t date a guy who asked me that, especially on a first date. I\u2019m sorry that you invested yourself in a relationship that didn\u2019t give as much as it took; I know that it\u2019s really not a good feeling when you realize how imbalanced a relationship is and I hope that you take what you learned from your time with her and use it to make better decisions in the future.",

But I'm saying that the assumption that all victims of sexual assault/rape are going to make it YOUR problem is a wrong one. One person, or a couple people even, doing that to you in the past doesn't make that a rule. \n\nThat's why you talk about boundaries beforehand, so you don't cross a boundary that might trigger someone with trauma, and you can set up emotional boundaries if you don't want to be trauma-dumped on. There's no need to make it into an, \"Oh, well that sucked that that happened to you, but clearly you're broken\" kind of situation.",

How does anyone not know about this! Why has this idea never been introduced to the public before?!?! Wait....is THAT what was happening to Marsellus in Pulp Fiction?? I just thought he was getting a really rough massage!!!!\"\n\nAnswering the question with this reply would be the quickest way to label yourself as a sexual predator, in case anyone was wondering! Deflection is considered a sign of guilt in psychology and in the criminal justice system, and when you chime in with this response to a question not even being directed at you... you are not painting yourself in a flattering light. You're basically accusing yourself of something no one ever accused you of in the first place. If you feel like your response was an appropriate reply to a woman hypothetically asking you that question, there are is no way you aren't saying other things that are making women feel unsafe around you. Just something to think about should you ever face trouble retaining SBs or maintaining meaningful relationships with women in general. It's hard enough to make women feel safe as it is, even with other women \ud83d\ude05\n\nIt's like going to a black lives matter protest with an \"all lives matter\" sign. Nobody was saying you were racist beforehand, but feeling the need to chime in and push your own unrelated agenda would lead people to believe you are in fact racist.",

It\u2019s depressing but you would be hard-pressed to find a woman who did not experience any form of SA in her life. You\u2019re probably less likely to encounter women who have been raped but even non-violent SA can be traumatizing. However that does not mean it\u2019s going to interfere with your relationship and the way her date asked her is incredibly rude and dehumanizing. I think it sounds similar to what you would ask a used car salesman about the history of the car you\u2019re interested in or like you are discussing the health of a puppy from a dog breeder; it is inappropriate and it isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s business. There are women who have experienced SA and it won\u2019t interfere with their relationship with you at all; you don\u2019t need to ask such an inappropriate question to gauge compatibility since women are humans and humans are complex beings who are capable of feeling differently about different men and don\u2019t have an \u201cI was assaulted so I\u2019m going to have issues coping with my trauma while with you\u201d button that is toggled. I think a far more effective way of discussing potential problems would be to start out by discussing boundaries and if things go well you can let it naturally progress. I\u2019m guessing in most SR there isn\u2019t going to be a huge gap between meeting and physically intimacy so if a SB is too much for you, you\u2019ll find out quickly. \n\nI understand that you had a girlfriend that struggled because of what she went through and you weren\u2019t having your needs met, but that\u2019s kinda your fault for not discussing boundaries and limits between you two or breaking it off once you realized you were not getting your needs met. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some thing that anyone should have to answer and I wouldn\u2019t date a guy who asked me that, especially on a first date. I\u2019m sorry that you invested yourself in a relationship that didn\u2019t give as much as it took; I know that it\u2019s really not a good feeling when you realize how imbalanced a relationship is and I hope that you take what you learned from your time with her and use it to make better decisions in the future.",

But I'm saying that the assumption that all victims of sexual assault/rape are going to make it YOUR problem is a wrong one.

There's no need to make it into an, \"Oh, well that sucked that that happened to you, but clearly you're broken\" kind of situation.",

How does anyone not know about this! Why has this idea never been introduced to the public before?!?! Wait....is THAT what was happening to Marsellus in Pulp Fiction?? I just thought he was getting a really rough massage!!!!\"\n\nAnswering the question with this reply would be the quickest way to label yourself as a sexual predator, in case anyone was wondering! Deflection is considered a sign of guilt in psychology and in the criminal justice system, and when you chime in with this response to a question not even being directed at you... you are not painting yourself in a flattering light. You're basically accusing yourself of something no one ever accused you of in the first place. If you feel like your response was an appropriate reply to a woman hypothetically asking you that question, there are is no way you aren't saying other things that are making women feel unsafe around you. Just something to think about should you ever face trouble retaining SBs or maintaining meaningful relationships with women in general. It's hard enough to make women feel safe as it is, even with other women \ud83d\ude05\n\nIt's like going to a black lives matter protest with an \"all lives matter\" sign. Nobody was saying you were racist beforehand, but feeling the need to chime in and push your own unrelated agenda would lead people to believe you are in fact racist.",

It\u2019s depressing but you would be hard-pressed to find a woman who did not experience any form of SA in her life. You\u2019re probably less likely to encounter women who have been raped but even non-violent SA can be traumatizing. However that does not mean it\u2019s going to interfere with your relationship and the way her date asked her is incredibly rude and dehumanizing. I think it sounds similar to what you would ask a used car salesman about the history of the car you\u2019re interested in or like you are discussing the health of a puppy from a dog breeder; it is inappropriate and it isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s business. There are women who have experienced SA and it won\u2019t interfere with their relationship with you at all; you don\u2019t need to ask such an inappropriate question to gauge compatibility since women are humans and humans are complex beings who are capable of feeling differently about different men and don\u2019t have an \u201cI was assaulted so I\u2019m going to have issues coping with my trauma while with you\u201d button that is toggled. I think a far more effective way of discussing potential problems would be to start out by discussing boundaries and if things go well you can let it naturally progress. I\u2019m guessing in most SR there isn\u2019t going to be a huge gap between meeting and physically intimacy so if a SB is too much for you, you\u2019ll find out quickly. \n\nI understand that you had a girlfriend that struggled because of what she went through and you weren\u2019t having your needs met, but that\u2019s kinda your fault for not discussing boundaries and limits between you two or breaking it off once you realized you were not getting your needs met. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some thing that anyone should have to answer and I wouldn\u2019t date a guy who asked me that, especially on a first date. I\u2019m sorry that you invested yourself in a relationship that didn\u2019t give as much as it took; I know that it\u2019s really not a good feeling when you realize how imbalanced a relationship is and I hope that you take what you learned from your time with her and use it to make better decisions in the future.",

It\u2019s depressing but you would be hard-pressed to find a woman who did not experience any form of SA in her life. You\u2019re probably less likely to encounter women who have been raped but even non-violent SA can be traumatizing. However that does not mean it\u2019s going to interfere with your relationship and the way her date asked her is incredibly rude and dehumanizing. I think it sounds similar to what you would ask a used car salesman about the history of the car you\u2019re interested in or like you are discussing the health of a puppy from a dog breeder; it is inappropriate and it isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s business. There are women who have experienced SA and it won\u2019t interfere with their relationship with you at all; you don\u2019t need to ask such an inappropriate question to gauge compatibility since women are humans and humans are complex beings who are capable of feeling differently about different men and don\u2019t have an \u201cI was assaulted so I\u2019m going to have issues coping with my trauma while with you\u201d button that is toggled. I think a far more effective way of discussing potential problems would be to start out by discussing boundaries and if things go well you can let it naturally progress. I\u2019m guessing in most SR there isn\u2019t going to be a huge gap between meeting and physically intimacy so if a SB is too much for you, you\u2019ll find out quickly. \n\nI understand that you had a girlfriend that struggled because of what she went through and you weren\u2019t having your needs met, but that\u2019s kinda your fault for not discussing boundaries and limits between you two or breaking it off once you realized you were not getting your needs met. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some thing that anyone should have to answer and I wouldn\u2019t date a guy who asked me that, especially on a first date. I\u2019m sorry that you invested yourself in a relationship that didn\u2019t give as much as it took; I know that it\u2019s really not a good feeling when you realize how imbalanced a relationship is and I hope that you take what you learned from your time with her and use it to make better decisions in the future.",

I think it sounds similar to what you would ask a used car salesman about the history of the car you\u2019re interested in or like you are discussing the health of a puppy from a dog breeder; it is inappropriate and it isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s business. There are women who have experienced SA and it won\u2019t interfere with their relationship with you at all; you don\u2019t need to ask such an inappropriate question to gauge compatibility since women are humans and humans are complex beings who are capable of feeling differently about different men and don\u2019t have an \u201cI was assaulted so I\u2019m going to have issues coping with my trauma while with you\u201d button that is toggled.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some thing that anyone should have to answer and I wouldn\u2019t date a guy who asked me that, especially on a first date. I\u2019m sorry that you invested yourself in a relationship that didn\u2019t give as much as it took; I know that it\u2019s really not a good feeling when you realize how imbalanced a relationship is and I hope that you take what you learned from your time with her and use it to make better decisions in the future.",
