    "body": "...is confidence. I understand we all have our insecurities, but one of the best things about sugaring is that we get to explore a fantasy life so just own them! I've read so many posts from both SBs and SDs asking if others will like them for being too curvy, not having the right curves, having the wrong skin color or hair, too many piercings or tattoos, having kids, being married, etc. At least for me, I've discovered that I'm attracted to a much wider range or people than I ever realized through sugaring, and the most important trait is just being comfortable in your own skin and in a SR. So try not to worry about it so much and have some fun!",

I have grown and matured as a person, lover, and friend many years after I should have. Now, at almost 75 years old, I am the man I should have been 50 years ago. Being a sugar daddy has made me complete. I hope you ladies realize the life-changing role you play in our lives.\u2764",

Maybe I can do better second time around.\n\nIt is a female truth, universally acknowledged, that in a room of equals, a man often will try to put a woman down for the same knowledge/skill/experience. It is how society views girls too and the values they instil in us growing up. A girl might be born with **confidence** in her abilities but put her in a room full of boys and it will be treated as **arrogance**. Same coin, different sides.\n\nIt is very endearing to hear SDs (and I would say emotionally mature men) say that they appreciate when a woman has confidence but unfortunately she has to re-learn what that means quite often. That seems to be why older men/SDs can be so attractive to younger women: simply because they treat them with the respect they should be getting. It is all a bit screwed up but hey, it is the world we live in. One man's poison is another man's meat.",
