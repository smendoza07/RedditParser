You can not see or touch the wind, yet are you going to say it doesn't exist because of it? Of course not. We see how it affects the environment, and how it affects us. Thus, we know it's there. It's the same with the soul. The soul IS part of our physical reality. We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well. He was horny, he couldn't help it.\" You see the issue with that? If you take the soul out of the equation, you take away half of what a human is, and then they just become your basic primate, only a bit more advanced.\n\nWhether or not the soul is what we believe it to be is up for debate. Maybe it's that part of the DNA we haven't figured out. Maybe it's a hormone we don't know we have. Whatever it is, we know it has to exist, because we've observed it for thousands of years and it's affect on us both as a species, and as the individual.",

Our human intelligence and our emotions is what gives us the ability to do what you said. Almost every animal like wolves are no where near as smart. Wolves are carnivores, they need to hunt and eat meat. They don't feel guilt, because they were evolved that way. If they felt guilt, they couldn't survive. It's all their brains. Brains and nervous system is what you are describing as the soul. When we die, our nervous system and brain shuts off like an electronic when out of battery. \n\n Intelligence \u2260 \"soul\".

Your mind, the thing that lets you think what you do, works by blending the information your brain collects and the moral guidance of the soul. Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

You can not see or touch the wind, yet are you going to say it doesn't exist because of it? Of course not. We see how it affects the environment, and how it affects us. Thus, we know it's there. It's the same with the soul. The soul IS part of our physical reality. We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well. He was horny, he couldn't help it.\" You see the issue with that? If you take the soul out of the equation, you take away half of what a human is, and then they just become your basic primate, only a bit more advanced.\n\nWhether or not the soul is what we believe it to be is up for debate. Maybe it's that part of the DNA we haven't figured out. Maybe it's a hormone we don't know we have. Whatever it is, we know it has to exist, because we've observed it for thousands of years and it's affect on us both as a species, and as the individual.",

Your mind, the thing that lets you think what you do, works by blending the information your brain collects and the moral guidance of the soul. Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

You keep saying the soul is what separates us from animals, so you are saying animals don't have souls. What separates us from animals is our intelligence, which again, is our brain. Our closest relatives are chimpanzees, and they surprisingly act a lot like humans. They even have wars and have war strategies against each other much like humans. They have very similar emotions to us too. They know it's wrong to murder and steal. They have \"souls\" too. Most animals lack the amount of intelligence we have, because they didn't need it to survive for millions of years. \n\n I saw God a few times in that wall of bullshit, and I'm just going to say: God is fake, stop believing in fairy tales. Don't believe a 2000 year old fantasy book, it was written by a man who wasn't alive when Jesus died.",

You can not see or touch the wind, yet are you going to say it doesn't exist because of it? Of course not. We see how it affects the environment, and how it affects us. Thus, we know it's there. It's the same with the soul. The soul IS part of our physical reality. We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well. He was horny, he couldn't help it.\" You see the issue with that? If you take the soul out of the equation, you take away half of what a human is, and then they just become your basic primate, only a bit more advanced.\n\nWhether or not the soul is what we believe it to be is up for debate. Maybe it's that part of the DNA we haven't figured out. Maybe it's a hormone we don't know we have. Whatever it is, we know it has to exist, because we've observed it for thousands of years and it's affect on us both as a species, and as the individual.",

Your mind, the thing that lets you think what you do, works by blending the information your brain collects and the moral guidance of the soul. Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

You keep saying the soul is what separates us from animals, so you are saying animals don't have souls. What separates us from animals is our intelligence, which again, is our brain. Our closest relatives are chimpanzees, and they surprisingly act a lot like humans. They even have wars and have war strategies against each other much like humans. They have very similar emotions to us too. They know it's wrong to murder and steal. They have \"souls\" too. Most animals lack the amount of intelligence we have, because they didn't need it to survive for millions of years. \n\n I saw God a few times in that wall of bullshit, and I'm just going to say: God is fake, stop believing in fairy tales.

Of course not. We see how it affects the environment, and how it affects us. Thus, we know it's there. It's the same with the soul. The soul IS part of our physical reality. We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well. He was horny, he couldn't help it.\" You see the issue with that? If you take the soul out of the equation, you take away half of what a human is, and then they just become your basic primate, only a bit more advanced.\n\nWhether or not the soul is what we believe it to be is up for debate. Maybe it's that part of the DNA we haven't figured out. Maybe it's a hormone we don't know we have. Whatever it is, we know it has to exist, because we've observed it for thousands of years and it's affect on us both as a species, and as the individual.",

Your mind, the thing that lets you think what you do, works by blending the information your brain collects and the moral guidance of the soul. Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

We see how it affects the environment, and how it affects us. Thus, we know it's there. It's the same with the soul. The soul IS part of our physical reality. We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well. He was horny, he couldn't help it.\" You see the issue with that? If you take the soul out of the equation, you take away half of what a human is, and then they just become your basic primate, only a bit more advanced.\n\nWhether or not the soul is what we believe it to be is up for debate. Maybe it's that part of the DNA we haven't figured out. Maybe it's a hormone we don't know we have. Whatever it is, we know it has to exist, because we've observed it for thousands of years and it's affect on us both as a species, and as the individual.",

Your mind, the thing that lets you think what you do, works by blending the information your brain collects and the moral guidance of the soul. Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

You keep saying the soul is what separates us from animals, so you are saying animals don't have souls. What separates us from animals is our intelligence, which again, is our brain. Our closest relatives are chimpanzees, and they surprisingly act a lot like humans. They even have wars and have war strategies against each other much like humans. They have very similar emotions to us too. They know it's wrong to murder and steal. They have \"souls\" too. Most animals lack the amount of intelligence we have, because they didn't need it to survive for millions of years. \n\n I saw God a few times in that wall of bullshit, and I'm just going to say: God is fake, stop believing in fairy tales.

We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well.

Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

We see how it affects the environment, and how it affects us. Thus, we know it's there. It's the same with the soul. The soul IS part of our physical reality. We can't see or touch it, but we know it's there. It's the thing that gives us a moral compass. That guides our decisions in right or wrong. We know it's there because we see the effect somebody has on it when there soul is \"touched\". Without the soul, you would only be guided by your consciousness. Your brain would only allow you to act of your bodies impulses and instinct, like an animal. Your consciousness is the blend of your mind being guided by the soul and the brain receiving information from the things you perceive. Our soul is the thing that separates us from animals. If you kill a pig for food, it's gonna feel bad the first few times. Your gonna feel awful from doing it for a while. But a pack of wolves would then slaughter that pig and feel nothing. It was hungry, the pig seemed like it would feed them, therefore they acted on their impulse and killed it. If the soul didn't exist, we wouldn't be the species we are. If we even managed to develop society, there wouldn't be laws in place. Crime would be through the roof but nothing would be done cause we'd have no sense of morality. \"Oh, that guy just raped that girl? Oh well. He was horny, he couldn't help it.\" You see the issue with that? If you take the soul out of the equation, you take away half of what a human is, and then they just become your basic primate, only a bit more advanced.\n\nWhether or not the soul is what we believe it to be is up for debate. Maybe it's that part of the DNA we haven't figured out. Maybe it's a hormone we don't know we have. Whatever it is, we know it has to exist, because we've observed it for thousands of years and it's affect on us both as a species, and as the individual.",

                                    "body": "No, I described what the brain is, and what the soul is and it's effect on the brain. Your mind, the thing that lets you think what you do, works by blending the information your brain collects and the moral guidance of the soul. Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",

Like I said, if you want to believe the soul is the 2% of DNA we haven't figured out, or if it's some hormone we don't recognize, or whatever scientific explanation you want to put behind it, the soul has to be real because it's what separates us from animals. Clearly you don't know how evolution works. Based off evolution, we shouldn't have any form of morality. Nothing to tell us what's right and wrong. The brain will only act on instinct. We see this in literally every living creature. They have no sense of morality and act purely on instinct. They have a brain but no mind of their own. Sure they make decisions, but those decisions are guided by the natural desire to preserve ones life. Again, a built in instinct. If humans didn't have whatever we want to classify the soul as, we wouldn't be able to make any decision other than what's best for our survival. Art, music, science, literature, the phone you are on right now, everything that we see today in society wouldn't be here. The soul gives us our natural curiosity to explore and invent. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. The only things we'd have constructed were basic tools for survival. We'd have never evolved to what we are now because there wouldn't be a need to.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt. I'm Christian. I believe we were created. But I also believe there is a good bit of truth to evolution. God knew the world would become a hostile environment for everything, and thus he gave us all the ability to adapt and evolve. So while I don't believe we evolved from another creature, I do believe we are an evolved form of what we once we're. I believe everything is.\n\nDo you get it now? Your trying to disprove the soul through science, and yet, from a scientific stand point, the soul has to exist. Whatever you want to believe it is, regardless of if it's from a spiritual stand point or a scientific one, it has to exist. Without it, we would just be animals. I mean we are already an animal from a scientific standpoint, but that's now what I mean. We would still be animals, out in the wild, living off the land. Instinct wouldn't tell us do develop government, separate ourselves by states and providences, cities and towns. We wouldn't spend the time to develop technology for the betterment of our species as a whole, or even for other species. We wouldn't care about anyone but ourselves and our offspring. Nature literally shows us how acting on pure instinct gives a species both an advantage and a disadvantage. And yet in our society, acting on instinct a lot of the time will you get in trouble. But if we didn't have the soul telling the mind what we're doing is wrong, nobody would pay attention when someone acts on instinct. It would just be normal. Everybody would act on it and so somebody not acting on it would seem, inferior. Weak, not fit to survive. Something wrong with their DNA. And chances our, that person would die a virgin.\n\nI'm not gonna keep arguing this. If your so narrow minded as to disregard the evidence society and nature gives you of the soul all because \"science\" said isn't real, then your the idiot. Not me. You want proof of the soul, I gave it, but you didn't want to acknowledge it because that would mean you'd have to admit your wrong about some of the stuff you know. What's that called? Oh yeah, pride. Something only humans care about. A feeling that can not be described through science like anger and joy. Have a nice day",
