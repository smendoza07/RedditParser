So take everything with a grain of salt and remember that there are extenuating circumstances that may affect what you yourself may expect to receive or give.\n\nPick your region and post your city or general area in this format. \n\n**Example: SB (28) Paris 700-1K weekly, includes overnights and gifts. no travel, indoor only.**\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* This is not a discussion thread no comments about what other people receive or give is allowed. Simply post your own info. \n\n* No rating of your sugar partners (i.e $500 for a 9 or  for old SD)\n\n* No breakdowns by hourly or sexual acts required for allowance. \n\n* Please note whether allowance is PPM, Monthly, Weekly,etc\n\n* Click reply under the green MOD  comment with the region/country you wish to contribute to and not other replies in that region. So deletions are not a problem.\n\n* Do not post your own regions or cities on this thread.
