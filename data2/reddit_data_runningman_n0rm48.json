    "body": "Wow. So I was late to find out about LKS leaving the show and I know so many people have been so heartbroken by this... but wow. I haven't been able to stop crying and I feel like I can't really talk about it to anyone right now because they'll just say that \"it's just a show\" and just... I am sooooo heartbroken and I always wish the best for the RM cast and their health, but I am just having trouble accepting this news (which is totally selfish but i think im allowed to be sad about this).\n\nI feel like I lost something that's a big part of me and I feel like I'm walking in a dream right now. RM has meant the most to me for ages now and hearing this news just tore my heart into pieces. I really hope and wish for LKS's full recovery and I also hope that everyone who is as immensely sad hearing this news can cheer up a little bit with just how sweet LKS is in this clip...\n\nI'm going to miss him and his little hidden sweet actions like this.\n\n(ep 369)\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/n0rm48/video/at15w8qa00w61/player",

I\u2019ve witnessed their awkward moments from the start and how they eventually became close to each other. I especially love their 7012 episodes. It shows the relationship they\u2019ve built for years.\nAnd especially LKS, he\u2019s really sweet and considerate of So Min and Ji Hyo. I\u2019d miss that so much about him. There are just too many things I love about this show. \n\nI\u2019m deeply saddened about the news but I know it\u2019s for the better. Hope to see LKS in Running Man again but in a much better state. Running Man, fighting!",

It's Running Man with LKS that kept me going. I still find it hard to accept that Gary already left RM and now LKS. Idk how I'll be able to move on once he leaves. :(",
