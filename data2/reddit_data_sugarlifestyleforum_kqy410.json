    "body": "Update: Thanks to the advice of the denizens of SLF, I messaged SD2 and asked him about Wife (ridiculous that I hadn't thought of it). He confirmed that she was not his partner, but was married to someone else. He had known her for years, and they met up if they had free nights in the same city. She asked him for my number, she knows about the nature of our relationship. The threesome we had was spontaneous, i.e. he was planning to see me, but she happened to be in London too. He figured she'd be up for it from past experience. He doesn't know who the third party is, and said it could simply be her husband. I did register a little surprise at this, but as he said \"She is not a woman to be unhappy in a marriage\". \n\nSo...I've agreed to the meet. But I'm not expecting anything till mid February...\n\nOriginal\nI am just about in the middle of a a couple of apparently overlapping affairs, and not too sure how to tread without affecting the sugar-stream in these strained times.\n\nI have limited my Sugar dating to people I have already met, which is best I can do since my rent and living needs to be paid for.  I have a SD (SD1) who I have seen on and off for a couple years, he is a part of a power couple. His wife is quite impressive ( I actually shared an elevator with them) and is also quite a strong personality by all accounts. He enjoys being more dominant and that's where I come in. I have been seeing him when he is in London. He has been quite helpful through the lockdown. \n\nSD2 is London based, and I met him early in 2020, and we did get along well. While I don't like doing much 'online', he has been more than generous and hasn't been physically available, so we have had a lot of online interaction with a few meets over 2020. He requested that I join him for a threesome ( we have done this previously). When I turned up at his flat, I saw SD1's wife...she did not recognize me obviously. I've learned to not let these kinds of things faze me too much thanks to some strange SR situations, or at least to compartmentalise potential awkwardness, and I must confess to have a fantastic time with them. I am quite sure they felt the same.\n\nShe has been in touch since (before this new lockdown) around arranging another meet with someone different...I am assuming that it is her husband...\n\nNow I don't know whether this is some complex game she is playing to expose her partner, or whether they have an open relationship...or whether she is in fact having an affair (same as him) and wants to have a threesome with her husband. It could be with someone completely different of course...\n\nThe lockdown has bought me some time I think, although they are not particularly law-abiding in that regard. Should I talk to SD1? Or SD2? Or should I just go with it and hope that SD1 acta surprised...?? What if it's going to be a major confrontation? I don't want to walk away from what could be a a great sugar source/s and some very good sexual experiences...",

My money would definitely be on one or more of the parties have more information than you think they do. If you want to continue the relationship with SD1 and If you have been seeing him for such a long time and the trust is there then I would talk to him about it. Honestly though telling SD1 is a bit of a breach of trust with SD2 and wifey, but it seems pretty obvious to me that you are getting played here.\n\nIt's possible that you are heading for a confrontation, but there is also the possibility that you are being included in some consensual marital shenanigans. Remember though that your consent is just as important so don't do anything that you are uncomfortable with. Good luck.",
