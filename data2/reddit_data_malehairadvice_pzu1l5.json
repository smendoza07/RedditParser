Far more guys can fully suit a crew cut or flat top crew cut; even more can fully suit an ivy league. Forward brush styles tend to suit guys with longer faces and quite wavy hair. \n\nThe buzz cut you got is a butch with a short to semi-short taper on the back/sides and it appears you are one of the relatively few guys who can fully suit a butch. Relatively few guys can fully suit your previous long style and likewise you are one of the relatively few; vibes of an early 90's Eddie Vedder...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CM6vhTc.jpg\n\nWhile you have your hair very short, should experiment with the other buzz cut styles, with your head shape, face shape, hairline and features, any of them can be designed to fully suit. And the way to grow out a butch and have it look fine as it grows out is to first grow out to a regular haircut by getting progressively longer haircuts every 2-4 weeks: short crew cut, medium crew cut, short ivy league, ivy league, long ivy league, short regular haircut, regular haircut etc\n\nConcerning buzz cut

But if you're looking to go shorter than that length just be mindful of how short you want it because your face shape is more on the taller side than it is on the wider side, which won't look the best with that almost close shave look because i've seen people who have done that and they just look like egghead aliens, and I've seen them with sharp jawlines, hairlines that still make up for that odd looking face shape. So if you plan on getting this haircut again i'd probably say the shortest you'll ever want to go for is the number 3 or 2 guard with or without a fade it doesn't really matter as long as it makes you happy about the look, however if you end up losing your hair by any chance just go for that close shave with the clippers, don't fight the way it looks because there's no point in fighting for something thinking that you needed for years that could've easily been taken care of with a single flick of a switch\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
