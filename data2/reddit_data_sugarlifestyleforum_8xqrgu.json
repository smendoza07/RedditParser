    "body": "Generally speaking I am fine with staying overnight (as long as the allowance isn't ppm). I prefer it to going home late at night when I am ready to sleep and like cuddling with my SD. However, its the behavior of SDs that has made it something to avoid for many SBs. \n\nSD gropes me awake at 6am and I ignore him and try to go back to sleep. No way am I being woken up that early for sex, I'm now annoyed because I am awake this early and can't go back to sleep. \n\nHe leaves for work and the following conversation happens over text:\n\n**SD:** I like having you in my bed... Next time I'm going to have my way with you in the morning though\n\n**Me**: Not really a morning sex person haha :) (Especially not at 6am)\n\n**SD**: I got that. I'll wake you up in the middle of the night then. \n\n**Me**: Please never wake me up in the middle of the night I would not like that. \n\n*No Response*\n\nSo he recognizes I didn't want to be woken up at 6am for sex, yet says he is going to do it next time anyway. Then makes it abundantly clear my sleep/wants don't matter if he wants sex (and yes the prior evening was fully satisfying).\n\nWhile I'm considering ending the relationship based on his terrible attitude (depends on how future conversations go), this type of behavior is not uncommon with SDs on overnights, and it makes SBs avoid them. \n\nDiscuss with your SB your expectations for overnights and ask her what she is ok with. Don't just thrust your dick on her in the morning expecting her to play with it, and NEVER wake someone up for sex without asking if its ok beforehand. ",

I purposely met him earlier so we could spend a similar amount of time together and I could still have a decent nights sleep. \n\nDidn't actually get to sleep until 12 because he wasn't tired but whatever. So you can imagine my befuddlement when I wake up at 3am to him stroking my ass and a hard on humping into my back. And when I stir, surprised, he takes this as an invitation that I'm DTF and puts his hand in my underwear. Fully knowing I don't fall asleep easily. Like, no. It's so inconsiderate. I know little brain takes over sometimes but it's no excuse.\n\nUntil otherwise stated, assume that the person you're with likes sleep. They will tell you if that's not the case.",

However, they are presumably largely in the minority I'd say so it's safe to assume that she won't be keen on being woken up and they should err on the side of caution. Those who are will let you know. If it's a dealbreaker, *communication first* rather than forcing it.\n\nMine has done this a couple of times (always super apologetic afterwards when it's too late and I'm stuck staring at the ceiling for an hour). One time, I just couldn't be bothered and let him do his thing while I was lying on my front trying to get back into the wild dream I'd just been having. Cue 'Baby, why aren't you into it?' 'Should I stop?' 'It feels weird you not being into it'. Well, duh \ud83d\ude44 It doesn't necessarily make someone a bad person but the lack of empathy it displays is worrying sometimes.",

Forgetting to turn off the water while filling the pool, forgetting to call when you're out, popping the clutch and accidentally rear-ending the dude at the stoplight in front of you. Those are easily forgivable. \n\nGetting \"dick haze\" and pounding away uninvited on a woman's vagina who is half asleep with your cock isn't one of them. That's one of those **_\"You broke the glass during the emergency motherfucker and there ain't no going back!\"_** kind of acts.\n\nThe fact you don't immediately next his ass just on being so disrespectful doesn't do your gender justice. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: And the fact this particular post is being downvoted into oblivion just means I'm right - and you fake fluffies are rubberstamping his actions.

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

I'd say about 60-70% of the time she was into it, depending on how the relationship was.  \n\nI personally don't like sleeping with someone who isn't into late night sex.  I'd rather sleep alone.  The tossing and turning is just another damn body to keep me awake.  Without sex, sleeping together has utility for the first hour and then it's a hindrance to sound sleep.  I personally prefer the girl goes home so I can get some rest.\n\nPersonally, ladies you need to understand something: if men didn't have irrationally high sex drives there is NO WAY we would pay you the kind of money we do in sugar for a few hours of companionship.  Worth it?  Only to those with overdrive libido.  Case in point, how many sugar mama's are there?

Don't just thrust your dick on her in the morning expecting her to play with it, and NEVER wake someone up for sex without asking if its ok beforehand.\n\nI can't imagine having to be told the above, but I absolutely believe you that guys are behaving exactly how you're describing.\n\nJust to give you some insight from the other side of the bed... and keep in mind this is an *explanation*, not an *excuse*, for this behavior: for many SDs, morning sex is something we had with women when we were single and in our 20s, and with our wives/ex-wives during the first few years of marriage before she stopped liking sex.  Or, in other words, not only is morning sex awesome on its own, but we associate it with some of the happiest times in our lives, and as a result, the dopamine rush just from *thinking* about being in position to have morning sex again, is amazing. The fact that he wants this with you, means you make him feel 25 again.  That is **not an excuse** for just trying to stick your dick into her at 3am as a surprise -- just some insight into how compelling and amazing it is, and how it makes us feel (at least some of us), and why an otherwise-awesome SD might suddenly become boorish when it comes to this.   I don't suggest having discussions about anything someone is passionate about over text; this is one where you might want to have it f2f. He made things even worse by texting you about it, instead of talking.  Yes, I realize I'm risking a zillion votedowns for this, but again, I am not excusing the behavior one bit, just giving some insight into what's driving it.\n\nFor myself, I ALWAYS have an explicit conversation about this topic... not even during the first overnight, but once it becomes clear overnights are a thing with us, I'll broach the subject to see what her feelings are.",

To someone else this might have been a lovely way to start the day. I don't think it reflects poorly on him unless he does it again after you've told him you're not interested.\n\nI think in his text he was probing to see if that morning was a one-off \"not interested today,\" or a policy of \"never interested in that.\" I think you made yourself clear. It's natural to reconsider whether a relationship is working or not whenever mismatched expectations arise. It will depend on how he feels about being with someone who doesn't enjoy morning sex and how you feel about being with someone who does.\n\nIt may not work out but there's no need to act as though he's done something heinous by initiating sex.

He did you wrong that morning ..... but do SO or boyfriends get away with doing the samething much easier ??   ",

But to me the difference is with a boyfriend I don't have to be on. I change into comfy PJs. Easily tell him to keep his hands to himself. Kick him out of bed if he's snoring, or go to the couch myself. I can actually relax and have a good nights sleep.\n\nWith a SD I imagine sleeping naked or in lingerie, feeling like I have to be open to sexual contact all night, I would never presume to kick him out of the bed that he's paid for or leave if I'm not sleeping well. I would worry about maintaining my looks through the night/in the morning. I would worry about not giving the perception of rushing out in the morning, even though I would want to go home so I could actually sleep. Maybe SRs that are more towards the vanilla end of the spectrum relax over time and you get to the stage where you can fart in front of each other. But in my experience the pressure of being in SB/customer service mode for long periods of time is exhausting.\n\nETA: I would compare a sugar overnight to the first couple of times you spend the night with a vanilla. When you're still trying to impress him. And add in the likelihood that you're not physically into your SD, and he may be more grabby and demanding than a vanilla since he's paying. ",

Forgetting to turn off the water while filling the pool, forgetting to call when you're out, popping the clutch and accidentally rear-ending the dude at the stoplight in front of you. Those are easily forgivable. \n\nGetting \"dick haze\" and pounding away uninvited on a woman's vagina who is half asleep with your cock isn't one of them. That's one of those **_\"You broke the glass during the emergency motherfucker and there ain't no going back!\"_** kind of acts.\n\nThe fact you don't immediately next his ass just on being so disrespectful doesn't do your gender justice. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: And the fact this particular post is being downvoted into oblivion just means I'm right - and you fake fluffies are rubberstamping his actions.

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

Even u/MAsugarbaby recently said how foolish SD'S are to pay for a few hours of sex.  ",

But to me the difference is with a boyfriend I don't have to be on. I change into comfy PJs. Easily tell him to keep his hands to himself. Kick him out of bed if he's snoring, or go to the couch myself. I can actually relax and have a good nights sleep.\n\nWith a SD I imagine sleeping naked or in lingerie, feeling like I have to be open to sexual contact all night, I would never presume to kick him out of the bed that he's paid for or leave if I'm not sleeping well. I would worry about maintaining my looks through the night/in the morning. I would worry about not giving the perception of rushing out in the morning, even though I would want to go home so I could actually sleep. Maybe SRs that are more towards the vanilla end of the spectrum relax over time and you get to the stage where you can fart in front of each other. But in my experience the pressure of being in SB/customer service mode for long periods of time is exhausting.\n\nETA: I would compare a sugar overnight to the first couple of times you spend the night with a vanilla. When you're still trying to impress him. And add in the likelihood that you're not physically into your SD, and he may be more grabby and demanding than a vanilla since he's paying. ",

The point is that there is no set definition and any expectations should be discussed beforehand.\n\n*Edit: You realize we are having sex the night before right?

He's an asshole plain and simple.\n\nShow me a guy that get's \"serious dick haze\" and I'll show you a guy that just volunteered to be an example to my class on how human bones are not supposed to bend.",

Forgetting to turn off the water while filling the pool, forgetting to call when you're out, popping the clutch and accidentally rear-ending the dude at the stoplight in front of you. Those are easily forgivable. \n\nGetting \"dick haze\" and pounding away uninvited on a woman's vagina who is half asleep with your cock isn't one of them. That's one of those **_\"You broke the glass during the emergency motherfucker and there ain't no going back!\"_** kind of acts.\n\nThe fact you don't immediately next his ass just on being so disrespectful doesn't do your gender justice. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: And the fact this particular post is being downvoted into oblivion just means I'm right - and you fake fluffies are rubberstamping his actions.

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

Even u/MAsugarbaby recently said how foolish SD'S are to pay for a few hours of sex.  ",

Forgetting to turn off the water while filling the pool, forgetting to call when you're out, popping the clutch and accidentally rear-ending the dude at the stoplight in front of you. Those are easily forgivable. \n\nGetting \"dick haze\" and pounding away uninvited on a woman's vagina who is half asleep with your cock isn't one of them. That's one of those **_\"You broke the glass during the emergency motherfucker and there ain't no going back!\"_** kind of acts.\n\nThe fact you don't immediately next his ass just on being so disrespectful doesn't do your gender justice. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: And the fact this particular post is being downvoted into oblivion just means I'm right - and you fake fluffies are rubberstamping his actions.

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

Forgetting to turn off the water while filling the pool, forgetting to call when you're out, popping the clutch and accidentally rear-ending the dude at the stoplight in front of you. Those are easily forgivable. \n\nGetting \"dick haze\" and pounding away uninvited on a woman's vagina who is half asleep with your cock isn't one of them. That's one of those **_\"You broke the glass during the emergency motherfucker and there ain't no going back!\"_** kind of acts.\n\nThe fact you don't immediately next his ass just on being so disrespectful doesn't do your gender justice. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: And the fact this particular post is being downvoted into oblivion just means I'm right - and you fake fluffies are rubberstamping his actions.

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

By your logic and my prior suggestion I should let him fist my asshole if he wants to because he is paying me and my wants \"aren't more important\".\n5. I would not have a vanilla partner that decided his sex needs were more important than my sleep. I would end that relationship immediately. \n\nI feel very sorry for anyone you have sex with because you clearly have very little understanding of how consent works .",

Those are easily forgivable. \n\nGetting \"dick haze\" and pounding away uninvited on a woman's vagina who is half asleep with your cock isn't one of them. That's one of those **_\"You broke the glass during the emergency motherfucker and there ain't no going back!\"_** kind of acts.\n\nThe fact you don't immediately next his ass just on being so disrespectful doesn't do your gender justice. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: And the fact this particular post is being downvoted into oblivion just means I'm right - and you fake fluffies are rubberstamping his actions. Sad. Very sad. ",

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",

It's just the way you described it as being rather reprehensible, and your reaction to it falls short of what I am used to seeing in general media these days with respect to dudes forcing themselves on women.\n\n> Your dramatization makes that apparent - there was no 'pounding' so I'm not quite sure what scene you've created in your mind or maybe you're just naturally hyperbolic\n\nSorry. I guess climbing on top of you whilst you're half asleep with him in a \"dick haze\" means what, exactly? A gentle backrub? Get you a cocktail? Not sure I was being hyperbolic based on your story - when someone mentions a guy experiencing a \"dick haze\" while fucking someone without asking who is half asleep? - you should grant me more than a little slack here, thanks.\n\n> less blind judgement of me would be fab :-)\n\nI could say the same thing about Chris Hardwick and the #MeToo backlash in his case, too. Don't like the heat? Don't light the match talking about \"dick haze\" and getting fucked while you barely had sleep and you were still trying to sleep while he was fucking you, and making it sound like although he's an ass, \"he slipped\" and won't take it that far again. \n\n> And I did end the SR because of his boundary pushing\n\nHmm. I didn't read that in your post. Did you say that? If you did - my utmost apologies - I will always certainly admit when I'm wrong. \n\n> Obviously he had enough redeeming factors and we had enough time apart for me to consider getting back with him and he knows better than to take it that far again\n\nSee, this is what I don't get. Like I said - to me some things are \"forgivable\", some, not so much. Like a battered woman will say \"he has his redeeming qualities\". Some grenade pins when pulled can't be put back. They're already tossed on to the field and explode. Jumping someone while in a \"dick haze\" is kinda one of those things. And this too is _just my opinion_.\n\n",
