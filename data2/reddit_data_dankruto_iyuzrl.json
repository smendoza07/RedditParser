Though, with Tenten being on his team, group training probably allowed Lee to train with weapons as well, which we see very little of. \n\nIn Boruto he takes a few steps backwards, with Guy pretty much incapacitated, Lee takes up his mantle, but is able to put forth his own philosophy along with the 'Power of Youth' and 'Will of Fire' ideals.",

Don\u2019t whine about it and fight to change it. Naruto literally did just that. \n\nHis destiny was to continue to be at odds with Sasuke, the other reincarnate. This directly conflicted with his goal of saving Sasuke. Still, Naruto never gave up and ended up ending the fated cycle of reincarnation. \n\nNeji himself even realized his ideology is bs when hiasha told him after the chunin exams that Neji\u2019s father voluntarily gave up his life. Neji only was a \u201cpeople are bound by their destiny\u201d type guy because he was under the impression his father was forced to die.",

Then he went around telling people what they could and couldn't do because he was pissed off about what he perceived to be his own destiny. Naruto told him that you can't do that because you don't know what your destiny is and you can't just assume that everyone will turn out a certain way and proved it by beating Neji, who had labeled Naruto as someone whose destiny it was to be weak.\n\nOf course Kishimoto kind of ruined that with the way he killed off Neji (yes I know it was an homage to how is father died but it still was pretty disrespectful) but Naruto's message still stood.",

Though, with Tenten being on his team, group training probably allowed Lee to train with weapons as well, which we see very little of. \n\nIn Boruto he takes a few steps backwards, with Guy pretty much incapacitated, Lee takes up his mantle, but is able to put forth his own philosophy along with the 'Power of Youth' and 'Will of Fire' ideals.",

Point that Neji couldn\u2019t break out his dynasty as he was born to protect the main family. Which why we counter argue Neji was right cause he did. And Naruto wasn\u2019t known as the fourth son. Also no Hokage born didn\u2019t come from a unknown family why Neji is right. They\u2019re either lucky born in a powerful family or struggle and work much harder just be another Rock Lee or Might Guy. Which why Naruto being Jesus is the problem with the Neji debate. I get what your saying, but Naruto changed the fate not the dynasty.",

Though, with Tenten being on his team, group training probably allowed Lee to train with weapons as well, which we see very little of. \n\nIn Boruto he takes a few steps backwards, with Guy pretty much incapacitated, Lee takes up his mantle, but is able to put forth his own philosophy along with the 'Power of Youth' and 'Will of Fire' ideals.",

By doing so, this continued their destined cycle of conflict. However, Naruto didn\u2019t give up, even after the atrocities Sasuke committed.

Then he went around telling people what they could and couldn't do because he was pissed off about what he perceived to be his own destiny. Naruto told him that you can't do that because you don't know what your destiny is and you can't just assume that everyone will turn out a certain way and proved it by beating Neji, who had labeled Naruto as someone whose destiny it was to be weak.\n\nOf course Kishimoto kind of ruined that with the way he killed off Neji (yes I know it was an homage to how is father died but it still was pretty disrespectful) but Naruto's message still stood.",

They\u2019re either lucky born in a powerful family or struggle and work much harder just be another Rock Lee or Might Guy. Which why Naruto being Jesus is the problem with the Neji debate.

Though, with Tenten being on his team, group training probably allowed Lee to train with weapons as well, which we see very little of. \n\nIn Boruto he takes a few steps backwards, with Guy pretty much incapacitated, Lee takes up his mantle, but is able to put forth his own philosophy along with the 'Power of Youth' and 'Will of Fire' ideals.",

Then he went around telling people what they could and couldn't do because he was pissed off about what he perceived to be his own destiny. Naruto told him that you can't do that because you don't know what your destiny is and you can't just assume that everyone will turn out a certain way and proved it by beating Neji, who had labeled Naruto as someone whose destiny it was to be weak.\n\nOf course Kishimoto kind of ruined that with the way he killed off Neji (yes I know it was an homage to how is father died but it still was pretty disrespectful) but Naruto's message still stood.",

Jiraiya, Ebisu and the others confirmed that Naruto couldn't do ninjutsu properly because of the foreign chakra within himself and how it made it difficult to control chakra. Kurama later said that he was always messing around with Naruto's chakra because he wanted to take him over and break out of the seal",

Though, with Tenten being on his team, group training probably allowed Lee to train with weapons as well, which we see very little of. \n\nIn Boruto he takes a few steps backwards, with Guy pretty much incapacitated, Lee takes up his mantle, but is able to put forth his own philosophy along with the 'Power of Youth' and 'Will of Fire' ideals.",

Which why we counter argue Neji was right cause he did. And Naruto wasn\u2019t known as the fourth son. Also no Hokage born didn\u2019t come from a unknown family why Neji is right. They\u2019re either lucky born in a powerful family or struggle and work much harder just be another Rock Lee or Might Guy. Which why Naruto being Jesus is the problem with the Neji debate. I get what your saying, but Naruto changed the fate not the dynasty.",

Though, with Tenten being on his team, group training probably allowed Lee to train with weapons as well, which we see very little of. \n\nIn Boruto he takes a few steps backwards, with Guy pretty much incapacitated, Lee takes up his mantle, but is able to put forth his own philosophy along with the 'Power of Youth' and 'Will of Fire' ideals.",
