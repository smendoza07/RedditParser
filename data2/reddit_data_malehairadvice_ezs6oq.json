It looks a lot better, but I would stick with something like a 2 on the sides, and blending the top to match.\n\nThere are a lot of guys in here who like the mustache, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents. Personally I would get rid of the beard and mustache entirely. Most of that beard is on your neck, it's not quite full enough on the face. Looks a little Amish.\n\nAnd women tend to hate mustaches. Maybe that doesn't matter to you, but if you're single I think you'll have more luck with the ladies without it. You have your whole life to grow a (probably much fuller) beard and mustache. You only look youthful once and the ladies like it.\n\nYou can keep a little bit of it if you're just trying to frame your face / jawline. I tend to recommend connected stubble on the face and mustache, just shave the neck up to the beard line. That's what I do.\n\nAnyway, again, big improvement! Nice job :)",
