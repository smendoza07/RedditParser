I mostly ask about his treatments and the most common ingredient he has had in his past and present treatments is benzamin/benjamin peroxide I think and I'm pretty sure he hasn't tried Salicylic Acid yet.

He's so glad about all the suggestions for his acne but he's being a pussy too and telling me that *benzoyl peroxide is working fine so he wouldn't want to take risk. No worries, I'll try and convince him.\n\nSpeaking of family, Manash has the same or similar situation. Now I shouldn't say anything about his family but for a fact, they have been quite abusive at times (he used to tell me and another friend about how his parents and siblings would treat him). He's almost 20 and still his mom buys him clothes (which are shitty, no offense) and I am guessing that he's sticking to his current prescription (benzoyl peroxide) also because it was his mom who took him to the doctor and they'll probably not be happy if he tries some other treatment and something goes south.

Honey itself is fantastic at healing skin and balancing bacteria. You'll have softer, more healthy looking skin within days of using it and it tastes great.\n\nHe's got some good features already so a haircut will turn it up to 11, easily.

He's so glad about all the suggestions for his acne but he's being a pussy too and telling me that *benzoyl peroxide is working fine so he wouldn't want to take risk. No worries, I'll try and convince him.\n\nSpeaking of family, Manash has the same or similar situation. Now I shouldn't say anything about his family but for a fact, they have been quite abusive at times (he used to tell me and another friend about how his parents and siblings would treat him). He's almost 20 and still his mom buys him clothes (which are shitty, no offense) and I am guessing that he's sticking to his current prescription (benzoyl peroxide) also because it was his mom who took him to the doctor and they'll probably not be happy if he tries some other treatment and something goes south.

He's so glad about all the suggestions for his acne but he's being a pussy too and telling me that *benzoyl peroxide is working fine so he wouldn't want to take risk. No worries, I'll try and convince him.\n\nSpeaking of family, Manash has the same or similar situation. Now I shouldn't say anything about his family but for a fact, they have been quite abusive at times (he used to tell me and another friend about how his parents and siblings would treat him). He's almost 20 and still his mom buys him clothes (which are shitty, no offense) and I am guessing that he's sticking to his current prescription (benzoyl peroxide) also because it was his mom who took him to the doctor and they'll probably not be happy if he tries some other treatment and something goes south.

He's so glad about all the suggestions for his acne but he's being a pussy too and telling me that *benzoyl peroxide is working fine so he wouldn't want to take risk. No worries, I'll try and convince him.\n\nSpeaking of family, Manash has the same or similar situation. Now I shouldn't say anything about his family but for a fact, they have been quite abusive at times (he used to tell me and another friend about how his parents and siblings would treat him). He's almost 20 and still his mom buys him clothes (which are shitty, no offense) and I am guessing that he's sticking to his current prescription (benzoyl peroxide) also because it was his mom who took him to the doctor and they'll probably not be happy if he tries some other treatment and something goes south.

We'll compile a list of all the suggested products including Accutane and then do our own research (it'll be mostly just me doing the research stuff lmao) and finally decide the safest one to try. Btw, Manash read most of the comments and he's really overwhelmed lmao. He's so glad about all the suggestions for his acne but he's being a pussy too and telling me that *benzoyl peroxide is working fine so he wouldn't want to take risk. No worries, I'll try and convince him.\n\nSpeaking of family, Manash has the same or similar situation. Now I shouldn't say anything about his family but for a fact, they have been quite abusive at times (he used to tell me and another friend about how his parents and siblings would treat him). He's almost 20 and still his mom buys him clothes (which are shitty, no offense) and I am guessing that he's sticking to his current prescription (benzoyl peroxide) also because it was his mom who took him to the doctor and they'll probably not be happy if he tries some other treatment and something goes south.
