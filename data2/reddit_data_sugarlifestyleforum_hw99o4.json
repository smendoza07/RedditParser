    "body": "Tonight I was sitting across the room from my guy, staring at him while he ordered us dinner on his phone and it hit me that \u201cthank you\u201d will never, ever come close to being enough to express how thankful I am for him. \n\nAfter working all day, he drove 40 mins. to where my classroom is and spent the next 3 hours hanging posters, taping labels on bins, and sitting in an elementary school kid chair eating take out food with me.  He expected nothing in return. \n\nWhen I joined Seeking I never imagined I\u2019d find the best man I\u2019ve ever met. My biggest supporter, my best friend, my greatest love.. and sometimes it makes me a little sad knowing that I will never be able to express the amount of love and gratitude I feel for him. No amount of words or actions could express all the feels. \n\nTo my guy - Thank you for being you. Your love and support make me a better person. \ud83d\ude18",

We\u2019ll all be sick at some point because of this. Grades 6-12 will only go to their school buildings 2 days a week (half the students 2 days and the other half the other 2 days) and learn virtually 3 days a week, but for some reason they think K-5 is all good to go back every single day. \n\nSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to get up on my soapbox right then.

We were told a week ago we were doing hybrid (1/2 the kids were coming Monday & Thursday and the other half  Tuesday & Friday with everyone online Wednesday, but 2 nights ago the board decided all K-5 would go back to everyday in the building while 6-12 would stay in the hybrid mode. So I\u2019m scared but going to try to make the best of it. How will your school year look as of now? \n\nI LOVE sitting cross cross. I don\u2019t have chairs either, I\u2019m all flexible seating!
