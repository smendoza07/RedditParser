Obviously, it will be put somewhere and enjoyed by others because it's *amusing* that someone would go to that length rather than simply tell the truth. It would be the same reaction if a SB had told an SD that she hadn't messaged the last few days because she stubbed her toe and spent the last few days crying in agony. It's ridiculous and quite honestly, a silly lie. Maybe instead of taking everything so seriously, lighten up a little?",

In fact, getting kicked in the balls is painful but has very little endurance - no where near days of suffering. Using an excuse is one thing but using one that is so unbelievable and outrageous? Obviously, it will be put somewhere and enjoyed by others because it's *amusing* that someone would go to that length rather than simply tell the truth. It would be the same reaction if a SB had told an SD that she hadn't messaged the last few days because she stubbed her toe and spent the last few days crying in agony. It's ridiculous and quite honestly, a silly lie. Maybe instead of taking everything so seriously, lighten up a little?",

Obviously, it will be put somewhere and enjoyed by others because it's *amusing* that someone would go to that length rather than simply tell the truth. It would be the same reaction if a SB had told an SD that she hadn't messaged the last few days because she stubbed her toe and spent the last few days crying in agony. It's ridiculous and quite honestly, a silly lie. Maybe instead of taking everything so seriously, lighten up a little?",
