    "body": "I am so happy about my new SB. She's a graduate student, smart, kind, beautiful, and a 10 in bed. She is always upbeat and cool and makes me feel like the hottest man on the planet. I get back rubs, her fingers through my hair, cuddles and kisses. We respect each other and it makes me want to do nice things for her in return. Honestly, it feels exactly like having hot dates. She's everything I could want in a SB. I feel so good again like I'm fully alive! Thank you my special honey if you ever read this post.",
