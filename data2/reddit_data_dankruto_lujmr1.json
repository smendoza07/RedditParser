I think that they could have introduced some lower level threats that would just waste team 7's time, but big enough for most people to piss their pants. If they could have slowly leveled up the villains to the point where Naruto and Sasuke would have to be involved and then boruto and co help out. Kinda like gojou satoru, the guy is a tank and no villain in jujutsu kaisen can currently stand up to that sheer power.

Even though I enjoyed the ending of Shippudden, introducing Kaguya at the very end and basically making Madara irrelevant was kinda forced and unnecessary. \n\nIf they had waited until after Boruto started to introduce the Otsutski it would have maybe made things more interesting and less rushed imo.",

It undermined Madara and everything that went into building him up, it was pulled out of nowhere. Alluding to the Otsusuki in the rikidou senin backstory would've been nice. Everything could've been the same except kaguya's resurrection. Id also change the reincarnation thing because it basically contradicts the initial message.",

I think that they could have introduced some lower level threats that would just waste team 7's time, but big enough for most people to piss their pants. If they could have slowly leveled up the villains to the point where Naruto and Sasuke would have to be involved and then boruto and co help out. Kinda like gojou satoru, the guy is a tank and no villain in jujutsu kaisen can currently stand up to that sheer power. Same way if they slowly leveled up the main cast it would be better \n\nBut I do agree, the power spikes in shippuden created a lot of these problems",

It\u2019s kind of impossible to write any convincing power scaling in a world where the former team 7 still exist because they should realistically be able to handle any and all threats with minimal effort (unless they\u2019re just continuing to come across even more absurdly powerful people to fight, but we\u2019ve already jumped the shark on that a while ago)",

I think that they could have introduced some lower level threats that would just waste team 7's time, but big enough for most people to piss their pants. If they could have slowly leveled up the villains to the point where Naruto and Sasuke would have to be involved and then boruto and co help out. Kinda like gojou satoru, the guy is a tank and no villain in jujutsu kaisen can currently stand up to that sheer power. Same way if they slowly leveled up the main cast it would be better \n\nBut I do agree, the power spikes in shippuden created a lot of these problems",

It undermined Madara and everything that went into building him up, it was pulled out of nowhere. Alluding to the Otsusuki in the rikidou senin backstory would've been nice. Everything could've been the same except kaguya's resurrection. Id also change the reincarnation thing because it basically contradicts the initial message.",

But the reason he himself is destined to become god level is because his dad is god level.\n\nIf he was living in some obscure distant village but with same body and genetic, he wouldn't really have had this much potential and growth.\n\nThink of it as kinda a Level 5 Pokemon you keep in first place of your party but immediately switch out for a Level 80 Pokemon to fight the opposing Level 80 Pokemon. He gains similar experience to the Level 80 person fighting Level 80 enemy. Of course, it's deliberate, but Minato choosing to store Kyubi in his day 1 born child is also deliberate.",

Kinda like gojou satoru, the guy is a tank and no villain in jujutsu kaisen can currently stand up to that sheer power. Same way if they slowly leveled up the main cast it would be better \n\nBut I do agree, the power spikes in shippuden created a lot of these problems",

Not proper Uzumaki level ofcourse, as that's 25% at most now.",

If they could have slowly leveled up the villains to the point where Naruto and Sasuke would have to be involved and then boruto and co help out. Kinda like gojou satoru, the guy is a tank and no villain in jujutsu kaisen can currently stand up to that sheer power. Same way if they slowly leveled up the main cast it would be better \n\nBut I do agree, the power spikes in shippuden created a lot of these problems",

That made people strongly attached to Naruto making his obvious plot armor very digestible. And now that Boruto has it instead of Naruto, those same feelings act very differently.\n\nAsk any Boruto manga reader and they will tell you it is solid with good fights and the anime would have a problem adapting the monthly issues if it did from the beginning.",

I think that they could have introduced some lower level threats that would just waste team 7's time, but big enough for most people to piss their pants. If they could have slowly leveled up the villains to the point where Naruto and Sasuke would have to be involved and then boruto and co help out. Kinda like gojou satoru, the guy is a tank and no villain in jujutsu kaisen can currently stand up to that sheer power. Same way if they slowly leveled up the main cast it would be better \n\nBut I do agree, the power spikes in shippuden created a lot of these problems",

That made people strongly attached to Naruto making his obvious plot armor very digestible.

But the reason he himself is destined to become god level is because his dad is god level.\n\nIf he was living in some obscure distant village but with same body and genetic, he wouldn't really have had this much potential and growth.\n\nThink of it as kinda a Level 5 Pokemon you keep in first place of your party but immediately switch out for a Level 80 Pokemon to fight the opposing Level 80 Pokemon. He gains similar experience to the Level 80 person fighting Level 80 enemy. Of course, it's deliberate, but Minato choosing to store Kyubi in his day 1 born child is also deliberate.",
