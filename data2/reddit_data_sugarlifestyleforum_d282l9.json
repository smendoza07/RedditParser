    "body": "Hey folks.  I am getting gushy texts from an attractive woman and have not yet had the heart to send \"thanks, but no thanks.\"  Here is a little story some people might learn from, or cringe. She is 27ish, a bit shy and nervous and:\n\nHer, \u201cI have only had one sugar Daddy, he is on the board of directors at (names the company).\u201d\n\nAt that point, I am thinking \u201cFuck, we might be done here.\u201d\n\nWhy? \n\nIt is a small world ladies and gentlemen. There are Very Few people in certain jobs. A Board of Directors has maybe 5 guys sometimes, presuming some women serve. She mentioned this guy\u2019s exact age (23 years older than me and yes, you can queue the evil laughter here!). She mentioned a third detail, and I am virtually certain I can identify the specific individual she is talking about.\n\nIf you are talking to a legit SD, please consider demonstrating that you will make his privacy a priority unless and until you are super clear he does not care. I am far less of a cloak & dagger guy than many. I have decent opsec, because I am semi well known in a little town deep in the U.S. bible belt, have been prominent in a charity affiliated with a religion and my mom would not be psyched.\n\nThere are guys on both coasts of the U.S. and elsewhere who totally do not care. I know a bigwig professionally. We run into one another in Miami, middle of the day at a fancy hotel (Fontainbleau). He is with two gorgeous women. This guy grins and says, \u201clet me introduce you to my wife Laura and my mistress Catalina.\u201d Both women roll their eyes and then offer smiles with some degree of humor. Still, most guys are NOT like that.  AT ALL.  \n\nYes, I know I am being a dick with the caps, but motherfucker I feel frustrated!  If things are working well, after several intimate dates, I may give you my full legal name.  This will only happen after you demonstrate common sense and keep personally identifiable information to yourself! \n\nAny other recent \"well shit, back to the drawing board\" moments y'all have seen recently?",

I responded occasionally to be friendly but that\u2019s about it. One day he asked me what I was doing and I told him that I was poolside (ironically at the Fontainebleau like the OP). \n\nHim: \u201coh nice. Send me a pic!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cdude... do you really think I would send you a pic of myself after you\u2019ve sent me photos of 20 other women with no respect for their privacy?\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cOhhhh.... but I wouldn\u2019t do that to you!

Just seems so deeply offensive to hide that information once you expect intimacy. And that woman may have thought she was still respecting his privacy by not telling you his name even tho she gave you enough info to find out who he is. I would never even get close to revealing any of those details, I can't even tell my POTs about one of the best gifts I was given because it will clearly reveal the identity of my first SD. But what's the problem? Did she tell his wife?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: just want to include the detail that I literally spoke to the wives directly of my past two SDs because of my job at that time (so we couldn't avoid it). Never revealed our secret. Both men are still happily married with wives who don't know any better. It is possible to be honest about your identity to a Baby who is tight-lipped and will play the game if the wife shows up in public somewhere.",
