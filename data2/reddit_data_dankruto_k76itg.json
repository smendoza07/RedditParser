It is probably the same case as with the chunin promotion: Shikamaru was promoted despite his fight ending in a draw, Naruto wasn't promoted despite winning his fight against Neji.\n\nSure, Naruto can force his way through most missions with his power alone, but pure fighting is not the only thing a ninja does. You have to know to delegate tasks to the team according to their abilities for maximum efficiency, you also need subtlety for infiltration missions or other stuff and we know for sure Naruto doesn't do subtle.",

Sone that sees a wood element user and doesn\u2018t immediately make the connection to Hashirama\u2019s line and therefore to Konoha should really work on their deduction skills.\n\nThe rest seems more like a contra point to your argument as you acknowledge these other two techniques can be learned and have been shown to be learnable **independent** of the users heritage. If the far rarer and almost impossible to attain wood element is fine in your book these two really should be as well...\n\nIt seems to me your not following through on your own logic there tbh so I\u2018ll just leave it at that.

It is probably the same case as with the chunin promotion: Shikamaru was promoted despite his fight ending in a draw, Naruto wasn't promoted despite winning his fight against Neji.\n\nSure, Naruto can force his way through most missions with his power alone, but pure fighting is not the only thing a ninja does. You have to know to delegate tasks to the team according to their abilities for maximum efficiency, you also need subtlety for infiltration missions or other stuff and we know for sure Naruto doesn't do subtle.",

Mokuton can not be replicated with just dedication and training.\n\nNot talking about Fireball though... rather stuff like Chidori which is flashy, loud and a signature move. Or Torunes Bugs that are unique even among the Aburame. To a degree the Sharingan too. \n\nAnd then there is the fact that ANBU missions seem to often follow a \u201ano witnesses\u2018 approach anyway... if you really wanted you could probably even add Yugao as she is using the same sword style Hayate used and that Baki commented on as being a Konoha technique.\n\nReally don\u2018t see what makes Minato\u2018s techniques that much more special than the other signature moves, that also have a connection to the leaf (and depending on which a much more exclusive one)",

Sone that sees a wood element user and doesn\u2018t immediately make the connection to Hashirama\u2019s line and therefore to Konoha should really work on their deduction skills.\n\nThe rest seems more like a contra point to your argument as you acknowledge these other two techniques can be learned and have been shown to be learnable **independent** of the users heritage.

It is probably the same case as with the chunin promotion: Shikamaru was promoted despite his fight ending in a draw, Naruto wasn't promoted despite winning his fight against Neji.\n\nSure, Naruto can force his way through most missions with his power alone, but pure fighting is not the only thing a ninja does. You have to know to delegate tasks to the team according to their abilities for maximum efficiency, you also need subtlety for infiltration missions or other stuff and we know for sure Naruto doesn't do subtle.",

It is probably the same case as with the chunin promotion: Shikamaru was promoted despite his fight ending in a draw, Naruto wasn't promoted despite winning his fight against Neji.\n\nSure, Naruto can force his way through most missions with his power alone, but pure fighting is not the only thing a ninja does. You have to know to delegate tasks to the team according to their abilities for maximum efficiency, you also need subtlety for infiltration missions or other stuff and we know for sure Naruto doesn't do subtle.",

Sone that sees a wood element user and doesn\u2018t immediately make the connection to Hashirama\u2019s line and therefore to Konoha should really work on their deduction skills.\n\nThe rest seems more like a contra point to your argument as you acknowledge these other two techniques can be learned and have been shown to be learnable **independent** of the users heritage. If the far rarer and almost impossible to attain wood element is fine in your book these two really should be as well...\n\nIt seems to me your not following through on your own logic there tbh so I\u2018ll just leave it at that.

It is probably the same case as with the chunin promotion: Shikamaru was promoted despite his fight ending in a draw, Naruto wasn't promoted despite winning his fight against Neji.\n\nSure, Naruto can force his way through most missions with his power alone, but pure fighting is not the only thing a ninja does. You have to know to delegate tasks to the team according to their abilities for maximum efficiency, you also need subtlety for infiltration missions or other stuff and we know for sure Naruto doesn't do subtle.",

It is probably the same case as with the chunin promotion: Shikamaru was promoted despite his fight ending in a draw, Naruto wasn't promoted despite winning his fight against Neji.\n\nSure, Naruto can force his way through most missions with his power alone, but pure fighting is not the only thing a ninja does. You have to know to delegate tasks to the team according to their abilities for maximum efficiency, you also need subtlety for infiltration missions or other stuff and we know for sure Naruto doesn't do subtle.",

Sone that sees a wood element user and doesn\u2018t immediately make the connection to Hashirama\u2019s line and therefore to Konoha should really work on their deduction skills.\n\nThe rest seems more like a contra point to your argument as you acknowledge these other two techniques can be learned and have been shown to be learnable **independent** of the users heritage.

Or Torunes Bugs that are unique even among the Aburame. To a degree the Sharingan too. \n\nAnd then there is the fact that ANBU missions seem to often follow a \u201ano witnesses\u2018 approach anyway... if you really wanted you could probably even add Yugao as she is using the same sword style Hayate used and that Baki commented on as being a Konoha technique.\n\nReally don\u2018t see what makes Minato\u2018s techniques that much more special than the other signature moves, that also have a connection to the leaf (and depending on which a much more exclusive one)",

Sone that sees a wood element user and doesn\u2018t immediately make the connection to Hashirama\u2019s line and therefore to Konoha should really work on their deduction skills.\n\nThe rest seems more like a contra point to your argument as you acknowledge these other two techniques can be learned and have been shown to be learnable **independent** of the users heritage. If the far rarer and almost impossible to attain wood element is fine in your book these two really should be as well...\n\nIt seems to me your not following through on your own logic there tbh so I\u2018ll just leave it at that.

Or Torunes Bugs that are unique even among the Aburame. To a degree the Sharingan too. \n\nAnd then there is the fact that ANBU missions seem to often follow a \u201ano witnesses\u2018 approach anyway... if you really wanted you could probably even add Yugao as she is using the same sword style Hayate used and that Baki commented on as being a Konoha technique.\n\nReally don\u2018t see what makes Minato\u2018s techniques that much more special than the other signature moves, that also have a connection to the leaf (and depending on which a much more exclusive one)",

Sone that sees a wood element user and doesn\u2018t immediately make the connection to Hashirama\u2019s line and therefore to Konoha should really work on their deduction skills.\n\nThe rest seems more like a contra point to your argument as you acknowledge these other two techniques can be learned and have been shown to be learnable **independent** of the users heritage.
