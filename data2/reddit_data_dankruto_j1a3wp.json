Then she has no personality depth, her only trait is that she thinks Guy and Lee are annoying.

Not saying it\u2019s super ultra rare, but it\u2019s not as basic as, say, regular clones or substitution. \n\nAnd honestly, it would have been scary if the show didn\u2019t go the way of the chakra megazord and eye hax powers. She can seal and unleash almost anything. And if they had ever expounded on her chakra nature, some seriously scary things could have happened between her weapons and an elemental affinity. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, she had the potential to be very formidable, it\u2019s just that she barely got any screen time and the show completely shat on weapons as soon as Shippuden started.",

Then the episode where she meets the other tool user in the second chunin exam and she had to learn to use better summons. And she was the first persons world we see in the infinite tsukuyomi we see and it explains how it works to the viewer.\n\nThere was also the development that she was aiming to wield the gold and silver brothers sealing weapons that she ends up attaining. I know we never learn her family background or anything regarding her past but I think she has at least had some effort put into her development.",

Not saying it\u2019s super ultra rare, but it\u2019s not as basic as, say, regular clones or substitution. \n\nAnd honestly, it would have been scary if the show didn\u2019t go the way of the chakra megazord and eye hax powers. She can seal and unleash almost anything. And if they had ever expounded on her chakra nature, some seriously scary things could have happened between her weapons and an elemental affinity. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, she had the potential to be very formidable, it\u2019s just that she barely got any screen time and the show completely shat on weapons as soon as Shippuden started.",

Then she has no personality depth, her only trait is that she thinks Guy and Lee are annoying.

Not saying it\u2019s super ultra rare, but it\u2019s not as basic as, say, regular clones or substitution. \n\nAnd honestly, it would have been scary if the show didn\u2019t go the way of the chakra megazord and eye hax powers. She can seal and unleash almost anything. And if they had ever expounded on her chakra nature, some seriously scary things could have happened between her weapons and an elemental affinity. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, she had the potential to be very formidable, it\u2019s just that she barely got any screen time and the show completely shat on weapons as soon as Shippuden started.",

Then she has no personality depth, her only trait is that she thinks Guy and Lee are annoying.

Not saying it\u2019s super ultra rare, but it\u2019s not as basic as, say, regular clones or substitution. \n\nAnd honestly, it would have been scary if the show didn\u2019t go the way of the chakra megazord and eye hax powers. She can seal and unleash almost anything. And if they had ever expounded on her chakra nature, some seriously scary things could have happened between her weapons and an elemental affinity. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, she had the potential to be very formidable, it\u2019s just that she barely got any screen time and the show completely shat on weapons as soon as Shippuden started.",

Not saying it\u2019s super ultra rare, but it\u2019s not as basic as, say, regular clones or substitution. \n\nAnd honestly, it would have been scary if the show didn\u2019t go the way of the chakra megazord and eye hax powers. She can seal and unleash almost anything. And if they had ever expounded on her chakra nature, some seriously scary things could have happened between her weapons and an elemental affinity. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, she had the potential to be very formidable, it\u2019s just that she barely got any screen time and the show completely shat on weapons as soon as Shippuden started.",
