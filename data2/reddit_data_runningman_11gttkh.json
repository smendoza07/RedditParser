Just go to twitter, FB or IG. She's only the least favorite on reddit. Previous recipients were also big names in Korea. IU, Lee Seung Gi, Seo Jin are all huge stars.\n\nThey wouldnt chose an ordinary civiliant to receive this, because there will be no one who care. Or maybe they did giving award to civilians but we dont know because not a lot of people care. The fact that we know about this event shows that they have spread the message even further from their target audience. A succes imo.",

But I definitely understand the PR strategy 100%, but just don't understand why celebrities would get an award for paying their tax when it's the norm anyway.

I pay tax but I don't get an award, where's mine \ud83e\udd23. \n\nThe quoted part you had responded to, I had put \"assuming they don't\" as in assuming the civilians don't receive the award, which isn't encouraging since people can think if they pay tax then why aren't they being awarded and celebrities are. That's where I was getting at, not against Jihyo or other recipients.\n\nEdit: additional text in the 1st para.",

Im just explaining why they choose sjh for this award.\n\nAgain this PR move is not to those who dont know her. They are specifically targetting sjh fans. She still has huge crazy fandom. Just go to twitter, FB or IG. She's only the least favorite on reddit. Previous recipients were also big names in Korea. IU, Lee Seung Gi, Seo Jin are all huge stars.\n\nThey wouldnt chose an ordinary civiliant to receive this, because there will be no one who care. Or maybe they did giving award to civilians but we dont know because not a lot of people care. The fact that we know about this event shows that they have spread the message even further from their target audience. A succes imo.",

But I definitely understand the PR strategy 100%, but just don't understand why celebrities would get an award for paying their tax when it's the norm anyway. Perhaps an award for something else, maybe charitable for instance (i think they probably have that) would be better but for tax it's generally the normal anyway.\n\nEdit: amended a word",

I remember all the hate So Min was getting due to Jihyo \"getting less limelight\", Jihyo has a mass following. But I definitely understand the PR strategy 100%, but just don't understand why celebrities would get an award for paying their tax when it's the norm anyway. Perhaps an award for something else, maybe charitable for instance (i think they probably have that) would be better but for tax it's generally the normal anyway.\n\nEdit: amended a word",
