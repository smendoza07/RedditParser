If we set a baseline chakra of 2 for Shukaku (2^1-tail ), then Kurama would have 2^9 chakra or 512. Adding up the powers of 2 from 1 to 7, you get 254 which is less than half of Kurama's chakra. On top of that, Kurama was split in half between Naruto and Minato so it makes sense that the Kurama half in Naruto would be able to cancel out the other tailed beast bomb and also why Naruto and B were pretty evenly matched (Hachibi would have 2^8 or 256 chakra). Also, 10 tails jinchuriki Madara would be at <75% chakra since he was missing half of Kurama and a bit of the others.",

Deidara's weakness is lightning and Sasuke had the sharingan as well. Which allowed him to see the tiny bombs. \n\nI'm just telling you about the power gap between them.",

He remarks to himself that he\u2019s already expended chakra and that he\u2019s low on clay for his technique at the start of the fight. Gaara however has ample ammo for his techniques.\n\nDeidara invading Gaara on home turf, means there\u2019s time/chakra he spent monitoring the perimeter (and potentially picking off a few guards) with his bird offscreen while Gaara would have had little to do. So yes he uses the village as a hostage to force Gaara to use more chakra, but with home court advantage, a village that could have helped, and the excess reserves of chakra a Jinchuriki has, it\u2019d be reasonable to say that that evened the playing field between Kage Gaara (who with very little time in between was Kage level without a Bijuu), and a half-assed Deidara who specifically needed Gaara ALIVE. \n\nIn other words - the Kazekage had every advantage and the hostages just lessened Deidaras handicap. The fact that he thought he could show up solo without being 100% and leave with a Kage is something we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in the series do - even Orochimaru (at top strength) brought Kabuto and Kimimaro",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

Every tailed beast has their own unique powers/abilities, and Kurama's unique ability is just his sheer amount of power/chakra. That's why his power is on a whole other level.\n\n**Shukaku**: Sealing Jutsu and defense\n\n**Matatabi**: Fire release abilities, speed/agility, taijutsu abilities (clawed fighting style we see Yugito using)\n\n**Isobu**: Many powerful water release abilities, we've seen it using some as well as Yagura (e: Coral palm)\n\n**Son Goku**: Lava release of course, not much more needs to be said, shit's op.\n\n**Kokuo**: Boil release, steam based ninjutsu, can increase the temperature of its chakra to its boiling point, granting it or it's jinchuriki super speed/strength. (a great example of how less chakra can be worth more when used more proficiently)\n\n**Saiken**: BUBBLES. ACID BUBBLES.\n\n**Chomei**: Basically butterfly pokemon abilities lol, also bitch can fly.\n\n**Gyuki**: The flexibility of his physical form both in terms of his body and his chakra (like how he can escape into a tentacle without even a mangekyo sharingan being able to notice), also his ink release powers.\n\n**Kurama**: Just straight up fucking chakra and chakra control to the point of being able to turn it into physical matter that he can use to fight with as efficiently as a shape shifting body.",

I see a lot of \"convo\" discrediting Kurama's ability but, think about it this way...Why was Kurama the tailed beast \"Destroyer\" of choice for one of the strongest shinobis (Madara)? Also for the tails argument,even Kurama admitted that the faux-obito ten-tails was on a different level chakra-wise to him, lending legitimacy to the \"more tails = more powerful\" argument. One of the best parts about Kurama was his \"black Air force\" energy in not gaf about the opinions of other tailed beasts, because he knew he was right. I also don't know if this can be considered a Kurama specific-ability, but Kurama was low-key a sensory-type bijuu. During the fight with jigen/ishiki, he clearly noticed the difference in power scaling, even telling Naruto to STFU unless he wanted to die. For me...\nKurama =\n- Unparalleled chakra (outside of 10 tails)\n- Sage Style access to natural energy (like he didn't have enough!)\n- Chakra Sensory abilities\n- Negative Emotions Sensing\n-(I might be wrong on this!) but he is the only bijuu i know that other people could tap into his chakra just from proxy, aka the ginkaku and kinkaku twins\n- he might not have a \"Specific\" release like the others but i think his arsenal more than compensates (aka he is a jack of no-trade but leader of all!)",

On top of that, Kurama was split in half between Naruto and Minato so it makes sense that the Kurama half in Naruto would be able to cancel out the other tailed beast bomb and also why Naruto and B were pretty evenly matched (Hachibi would have 2^8 or 256 chakra). Also, 10 tails jinchuriki Madara would be at <75% chakra since he was missing half of Kurama and a bit of the others.",

Gaara however has ample ammo for his techniques.\n\nDeidara invading Gaara on home turf, means there\u2019s time/chakra he spent monitoring the perimeter (and potentially picking off a few guards) with his bird offscreen while Gaara would have had little to do. So yes he uses the village as a hostage to force Gaara to use more chakra, but with home court advantage, a village that could have helped, and the excess reserves of chakra a Jinchuriki has, it\u2019d be reasonable to say that that evened the playing field between Kage Gaara (who with very little time in between was Kage level without a Bijuu), and a half-assed Deidara who specifically needed Gaara ALIVE. \n\nIn other words - the Kazekage had every advantage and the hostages just lessened Deidaras handicap. The fact that he thought he could show up solo without being 100% and leave with a Kage is something we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in the series do - even Orochimaru (at top strength) brought Kabuto and Kimimaro",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

I see a lot of \"convo\" discrediting Kurama's ability but, think about it this way...Why was Kurama the tailed beast \"Destroyer\" of choice for one of the strongest shinobis (Madara)? Also for the tails argument,even Kurama admitted that the faux-obito ten-tails was on a different level chakra-wise to him, lending legitimacy to the \"more tails = more powerful\" argument. One of the best parts about Kurama was his \"black Air force\" energy in not gaf about the opinions of other tailed beasts, because he knew he was right. I also don't know if this can be considered a Kurama specific-ability, but Kurama was low-key a sensory-type bijuu. During the fight with jigen/ishiki, he clearly noticed the difference in power scaling, even telling Naruto to STFU unless he wanted to die. For me...\nKurama =\n- Unparalleled chakra (outside of 10 tails)\n- Sage Style access to natural energy (like he didn't have enough!)\n- Chakra Sensory abilities\n- Negative Emotions Sensing\n-(I might be wrong on this!) but he is the only bijuu i know that other people could tap into his chakra just from proxy, aka the ginkaku and kinkaku twins\n- he might not have a \"Specific\" release like the others but i think his arsenal more than compensates (aka he is a jack of no-trade but leader of all!)",

On top of that, Kurama was split in half between Naruto and Minato so it makes sense that the Kurama half in Naruto would be able to cancel out the other tailed beast bomb and also why Naruto and B were pretty evenly matched (Hachibi would have 2^8 or 256 chakra). Also, 10 tails jinchuriki Madara would be at <75% chakra since he was missing half of Kurama and a bit of the others.",

He remarks to himself that he\u2019s already expended chakra and that he\u2019s low on clay for his technique at the start of the fight. Gaara however has ample ammo for his techniques.\n\nDeidara invading Gaara on home turf, means there\u2019s time/chakra he spent monitoring the perimeter (and potentially picking off a few guards) with his bird offscreen while Gaara would have had little to do. So yes he uses the village as a hostage to force Gaara to use more chakra, but with home court advantage, a village that could have helped, and the excess reserves of chakra a Jinchuriki has, it\u2019d be reasonable to say that that evened the playing field between Kage Gaara (who with very little time in between was Kage level without a Bijuu), and a half-assed Deidara who specifically needed Gaara ALIVE. \n\nIn other words - the Kazekage had every advantage and the hostages just lessened Deidaras handicap. The fact that he thought he could show up solo without being 100% and leave with a Kage is something we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in the series do - even Orochimaru (at top strength) brought Kabuto and Kimimaro",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

On top of that, Kurama was split in half between Naruto and Minato so it makes sense that the Kurama half in Naruto would be able to cancel out the other tailed beast bomb and also why Naruto and B were pretty evenly matched (Hachibi would have 2^8 or 256 chakra). Also, 10 tails jinchuriki Madara would be at <75% chakra since he was missing half of Kurama and a bit of the others.",

He remarks to himself that he\u2019s already expended chakra and that he\u2019s low on clay for his technique at the start of the fight. Gaara however has ample ammo for his techniques.\n\nDeidara invading Gaara on home turf, means there\u2019s time/chakra he spent monitoring the perimeter (and potentially picking off a few guards) with his bird offscreen while Gaara would have had little to do. So yes he uses the village as a hostage to force Gaara to use more chakra, but with home court advantage, a village that could have helped, and the excess reserves of chakra a Jinchuriki has, it\u2019d be reasonable to say that that evened the playing field between Kage Gaara (who with very little time in between was Kage level without a Bijuu), and a half-assed Deidara who specifically needed Gaara ALIVE. \n\nIn other words - the Kazekage had every advantage and the hostages just lessened Deidaras handicap. The fact that he thought he could show up solo without being 100% and leave with a Kage is something we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in the series do - even Orochimaru (at top strength) brought Kabuto and Kimimaro",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

He remarks to himself that he\u2019s already expended chakra and that he\u2019s low on clay for his technique at the start of the fight. Gaara however has ample ammo for his techniques.\n\nDeidara invading Gaara on home turf, means there\u2019s time/chakra he spent monitoring the perimeter (and potentially picking off a few guards) with his bird offscreen while Gaara would have had little to do. So yes he uses the village as a hostage to force Gaara to use more chakra, but with home court advantage, a village that could have helped, and the excess reserves of chakra a Jinchuriki has, it\u2019d be reasonable to say that that evened the playing field between Kage Gaara (who with very little time in between was Kage level without a Bijuu), and a half-assed Deidara who specifically needed Gaara ALIVE. \n\nIn other words - the Kazekage had every advantage and the hostages just lessened Deidaras handicap. The fact that he thought he could show up solo without being 100% and leave with a Kage is something we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in the series do - even Orochimaru (at top strength) brought Kabuto and Kimimaro",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

He remarks to himself that he\u2019s already expended chakra and that he\u2019s low on clay for his technique at the start of the fight. Gaara however has ample ammo for his techniques.\n\nDeidara invading Gaara on home turf, means there\u2019s time/chakra he spent monitoring the perimeter (and potentially picking off a few guards) with his bird offscreen while Gaara would have had little to do. So yes he uses the village as a hostage to force Gaara to use more chakra, but with home court advantage, a village that could have helped, and the excess reserves of chakra a Jinchuriki has, it\u2019d be reasonable to say that that evened the playing field between Kage Gaara (who with very little time in between was Kage level without a Bijuu), and a half-assed Deidara who specifically needed Gaara ALIVE. \n\nIn other words - the Kazekage had every advantage and the hostages just lessened Deidaras handicap. The fact that he thought he could show up solo without being 100% and leave with a Kage is something we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in the series do - even Orochimaru (at top strength) brought Kabuto and Kimimaro",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

I mean hes capable of it in naruto and all he needs to do is pass out? Pretty sure deidara met that requirement for him, even if gaara had used all his chakra I doubt shukaku had used all of his, look I\u2019ll acknowledge that Deidara has a very reasonable chance to defeat gaara when going for the kill, but it almost feels like gaara has reverse plot armor for this fight, either way you sure know your naruto dude!",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",

It never made sense to me why he shouldn\u2019t have brought out Shukaku, though I used to just tell myself it wouldn\u2019t matter much since he wasn\u2019t too much stronger than Gamabunta anyway. But then late Shippuden screwed with the power scale and hints that Shukakku should be much stronger - which made it even more dumb that he never got used again. \n\nMy head cannon answer would be that Gaara still couldn\u2019t control Shukakku and worried releasing him would damage the village - but this is lazy at best since the alternative was the complete destruction of the village. Plus Gaara would have needed to prove much better control of his Bijuu for anyone to let him be Kage, and his general demeanor shows he isn\u2019t still going insane from Shukakku fucking with him in his nightmares.\n\nI think if he had released Shukakku Deidara would have felt more comfortable using the bomb he sent at the village on Gaara directly - so the question becomes do you think Shukakku could tank it?",
