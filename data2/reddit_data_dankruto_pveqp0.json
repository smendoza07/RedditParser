What Rasa did could be considered abuse since Gaara was quite literally fighting for his life every mf day because of his shitty dad. Hiashi was 50/50. He treated Hina like a verbal puching bag and aggrevated her simple shyness into crippling social anxiety until 1 talk of their home life from Neji had her nearly having a mental breakdown in front of an audience. If that doesn't scream abuse then I don't know what does. Sure Fugaku had his moments and he did ccontribute to Sasuke getting a minor inferiority complex towards Itachi but when Sasuke did something good \\[doing fireball jutsu correctly\\] he congratulated him. He never forced Sasuke to hurt the people he loved, tried to assasinate him etc so yea it's barely but he's still better Rssa and Hiashi but worse than Shikaku and Inoichi who were standard fathers",

First of all it was a time of war, were kids as young as 6 were being sent on the battle field to kill \\[Kakashi\\]. Every person was needed. You couldn't afford to coddle your child. Also add the fact that Itachi was always into becoming the strongest for peace and as a result always pushed his limits to points were it would be counter productive not to let him help. Fugaku and Mikoto wanted Itachi to be a kid but Konoha and him said hell nah. If anyone can be considered abusive towards Itachi it's fucking Danzo who quite literally brainwashed him into commiting a massacre and Hiruzen was complicit by pointedly spending his time reading porn over negotiating with them. Fugaku knew what a coup de tat would do the clan so he avoided for as long as possible. The Uchiha were rightfully pissed off I mean they helped built Konoha but they were now being given minor clan status... Fugaku wanted Itachi to be strong enough to protect those he wished but Itachi was a 1nce in a generation that simply surpassed Fugaku and set a standard which Sasuke later struggled to reach let alone Fugaku himself. Add the fact that when you become a genin you're parents can no longer control your actions and FugaMiko trusted Itachi, he was left to foster his strength and bonds \\[his genin teammates, Shisui, Izumi etc\\] Now don't get me wrong Itachi should have gotten more supervision but he was already a grown adult in the eyes of Konoha, if he commited a crime he'd be held accountable. Fugaku was neglectful not abusive. Change my mind logically and diplomatically.",

Like I said it was a time of war and the sinobi world practices total warfare which means literally everyone is affected and will fight for their country. When I say Kakashi started killing at 6 I mean at an extremely young age. Afterall there's no official date. I want u to tell me what Fugaku was supposed to do??? Treat Itachi like God's gift to earth when they were literally kids  younger than him \\[Naruto and Gaara\\] being turned into living nukes??? Now I admit he kinda did drop the ball but considering he wanted Itachi to understand that in the world they live in they can't afford to show compassion to everyone it was a good lesson but horrible fucking timing. Fugaku should have waited longer but that's an idealist pov. Like I said Konoha, Danzo and Itachi himself worked him to the bone. I read the Itachi shinden and I never encountered anything that said that Fugaku was forcing Itachi on missions. Itachi wanted to be strong, what right did Fugaku have  to stop him ??? You're probably gonna say as his dad but think of it this way: what would happen if Fugaku a world renowned police officer was restricting his son from going stronger for Konoha's benefit?? It would look mighty sus and since Itachi was 1 in a kind prodigy it would be insulting to the village. When Itachi became a genin he was no longer under his parent's control. Similar to how 18 year old's can move out and their parents can't stop them, Itachi was considered an adult by Konoha. He didn't have to listen to his parents anymore, he still did ofc but they were plenty of times he showed open disobedience and his status as Anbu stopped any blame coming through.\n\nThe Uchiha are full of bs but they were legitimtely mad back then. While on paper they were supposed to be 1 of the most recongnized clans that just wouldn't come to be under Danzo. They were given police status just so they'd never think about reaching the top even though it was their right as 1 of the founding clans to have at least 1 of their members reach the top. It was that simple, if Hiruzen had had a backbone back then and told Danzo to fuck off and negotiated with the Uchiha to let Fugaku or sth become the next hokage the issues would have died. Afterall to make Minato look good, Fugaku's own accomplishments \\[ the moniker Wicked Eye Fugaku\\] was swept under the rug and that rightfully pissed off the Uchiha. That's like Sasuke and Naruto doing a project but Sasuke refuses to acknowledge Naru's involvement and not expecting him to be mad about it. Fugaku simply let it go. After the Kyuubi attack instead of someone literally attempting to work with the Uchiha to prove their innocence, the village said NAAH FAM Y'ALL ARE GUILTY AND ARE GONNA BE CONVICTED WITHOUT A TRIAL. They were being pushed to the outskirts of Konoha, being under constant surveillance even Sasuke who quite literally was the most innocent loving kid at the time, their kids being tormented for simply belonging to the clan \\[Itachi and Izumi\\] Now I'm not really sure if this is correct but I'm pretty sure Shisui got his mangekyo Sharigan at 7 so that means he had been put in a position where he unlocked and saw someone precious to him die so considering the fact that Shisui was showing mastery and such it's more than plausible that he was sent on the battlefield at 5 minimum. The Uchiha were being treated like some mfing outcasts, did Konoha really expect them not to get tired of the shit sooner or later. Fugaku was constantly telling the Uchiha to seek diplomacy until he just couldn't anymore without looking a bitch ass who'll accept insults to his family lying down. Danzo made sure the Uchiha were always harboring ill will towards Konoha until he had a legitimate reason to order Itachi to kill the clan. I mean if you're continously being shown disrespect by someone sooner or later, you'll return the favour. But the Uchiha were wrong on the part where they were willing to get the Kyuubi by removing it from Naru which would've killed him in order to get their respect back . That was wrong and cruel since Naru did literally nothing for them to justify it. Afterall they had Sasuke at the same age as Naru, they should have been more considerate",

She constantly complimented him and was his no 1 supporter besides Itachi so wtf you talking about. Fugaku was neglectful not abusive. There's a difference. What Rasa did could be considered abuse since Gaara was quite literally fighting for his life every mf day because of his shitty dad. Hiashi was 50/50. He treated Hina like a verbal puching bag and aggrevated her simple shyness into crippling social anxiety until 1 talk of their home life from Neji had her nearly having a mental breakdown in front of an audience. If that doesn't scream abuse then I don't know what does. Sure Fugaku had his moments and he did ccontribute to Sasuke getting a minor inferiority complex towards Itachi but when Sasuke did something good \\[doing fireball jutsu correctly\\] he congratulated him. He never forced Sasuke to hurt the people he loved, tried to assasinate him etc so yea it's barely but he's still better Rssa and Hiashi but worse than Shikaku and Inoichi who were standard fathers",

First of all it was a time of war, were kids as young as 6 were being sent on the battle field to kill \\[Kakashi\\]. Every person was needed. You couldn't afford to coddle your child. Also add the fact that Itachi was always into becoming the strongest for peace and as a result always pushed his limits to points were it would be counter productive not to let him help. Fugaku and Mikoto wanted Itachi to be a kid but Konoha and him said hell nah. If anyone can be considered abusive towards Itachi it's fucking Danzo who quite literally brainwashed him into commiting a massacre and Hiruzen was complicit by pointedly spending his time reading porn over negotiating with them. Fugaku knew what a coup de tat would do the clan so he avoided for as long as possible. The Uchiha were rightfully pissed off I mean they helped built Konoha but they were now being given minor clan status... Fugaku wanted Itachi to be strong enough to protect those he wished but Itachi was a 1nce in a generation that simply surpassed Fugaku and set a standard which Sasuke later struggled to reach let alone Fugaku himself. Add the fact that when you become a genin you're parents can no longer control your actions and FugaMiko trusted Itachi, he was left to foster his strength and bonds \\[his genin teammates, Shisui, Izumi etc\\] Now don't get me wrong Itachi should have gotten more supervision but he was already a grown adult in the eyes of Konoha, if he commited a crime he'd be held accountable. Fugaku was neglectful not abusive. Change my mind logically and diplomatically.",

Like I said it was a time of war and the sinobi world practices total warfare which means literally everyone is affected and will fight for their country. When I say Kakashi started killing at 6 I mean at an extremely young age. Afterall there's no official date. I want u to tell me what Fugaku was supposed to do??? Treat Itachi like God's gift to earth when they were literally kids  younger than him \\[Naruto and Gaara\\] being turned into living nukes??? Now I admit he kinda did drop the ball but considering he wanted Itachi to understand that in the world they live in they can't afford to show compassion to everyone it was a good lesson but horrible fucking timing. Fugaku should have waited longer but that's an idealist pov. Like I said Konoha, Danzo and Itachi himself worked him to the bone. I read the Itachi shinden and I never encountered anything that said that Fugaku was forcing Itachi on missions. Itachi wanted to be strong, what right did Fugaku have  to stop him ??? You're probably gonna say as his dad but think of it this way: what would happen if Fugaku a world renowned police officer was restricting his son from going stronger for Konoha's benefit?? It would look mighty sus and since Itachi was 1 in a kind prodigy it would be insulting to the village. When Itachi became a genin he was no longer under his parent's control. Similar to how 18 year old's can move out and their parents can't stop them, Itachi was considered an adult by Konoha. He didn't have to listen to his parents anymore, he still did ofc but they were plenty of times he showed open disobedience and his status as Anbu stopped any blame coming through.\n\nThe Uchiha are full of bs but they were legitimtely mad back then. While on paper they were supposed to be 1 of the most recongnized clans that just wouldn't come to be under Danzo. They were given police status just so they'd never think about reaching the top even though it was their right as 1 of the founding clans to have at least 1 of their members reach the top. It was that simple, if Hiruzen had had a backbone back then and told Danzo to fuck off and negotiated with the Uchiha to let Fugaku or sth become the next hokage the issues would have died. Afterall to make Minato look good, Fugaku's own accomplishments \\[ the moniker Wicked Eye Fugaku\\] was swept under the rug and that rightfully pissed off the Uchiha. That's like Sasuke and Naruto doing a project but Sasuke refuses to acknowledge Naru's involvement and not expecting him to be mad about it. Fugaku simply let it go. After the Kyuubi attack instead of someone literally attempting to work with the Uchiha to prove their innocence, the village said NAAH FAM Y'ALL ARE GUILTY AND ARE GONNA BE CONVICTED WITHOUT A TRIAL. They were being pushed to the outskirts of Konoha, being under constant surveillance even Sasuke who quite literally was the most innocent loving kid at the time, their kids being tormented for simply belonging to the clan \\[Itachi and Izumi\\] Now I'm not really sure if this is correct but I'm pretty sure Shisui got his mangekyo Sharigan at 7 so that means he had been put in a position where he unlocked and saw someone precious to him die so considering the fact that Shisui was showing mastery and such it's more than plausible that he was sent on the battlefield at 5 minimum. The Uchiha were being treated like some mfing outcasts, did Konoha really expect them not to get tired of the shit sooner or later. Fugaku was constantly telling the Uchiha to seek diplomacy until he just couldn't anymore without looking a bitch ass who'll accept insults to his family lying down. Danzo made sure the Uchiha were always harboring ill will towards Konoha until he had a legitimate reason to order Itachi to kill the clan. I mean if you're continously being shown disrespect by someone sooner or later, you'll return the favour. But the Uchiha were wrong on the part where they were willing to get the Kyuubi by removing it from Naru which would've killed him in order to get their respect back . That was wrong and cruel since Naru did literally nothing for them to justify it. Afterall they had Sasuke at the same age as Naru, they should have been more considerate",

He treated Hina like a verbal puching bag and aggrevated her simple shyness into crippling social anxiety until 1 talk of their home life from Neji had her nearly having a mental breakdown in front of an audience. If that doesn't scream abuse then I don't know what does. Sure Fugaku had his moments and he did ccontribute to Sasuke getting a minor inferiority complex towards Itachi but when Sasuke did something good \\[doing fireball jutsu correctly\\] he congratulated him. He never forced Sasuke to hurt the people he loved, tried to assasinate him etc so yea it's barely but he's still better Rssa and Hiashi but worse than Shikaku and Inoichi who were standard fathers",

First of all it was a time of war, were kids as young as 6 were being sent on the battle field to kill \\[Kakashi\\]. Every person was needed. You couldn't afford to coddle your child. Also add the fact that Itachi was always into becoming the strongest for peace and as a result always pushed his limits to points were it would be counter productive not to let him help. Fugaku and Mikoto wanted Itachi to be a kid but Konoha and him said hell nah. If anyone can be considered abusive towards Itachi it's fucking Danzo who quite literally brainwashed him into commiting a massacre and Hiruzen was complicit by pointedly spending his time reading porn over negotiating with them. Fugaku knew what a coup de tat would do the clan so he avoided for as long as possible. The Uchiha were rightfully pissed off I mean they helped built Konoha but they were now being given minor clan status... Fugaku wanted Itachi to be strong enough to protect those he wished but Itachi was a 1nce in a generation that simply surpassed Fugaku and set a standard which Sasuke later struggled to reach let alone Fugaku himself. Add the fact that when you become a genin you're parents can no longer control your actions and FugaMiko trusted Itachi, he was left to foster his strength and bonds \\[his genin teammates, Shisui, Izumi etc\\] Now don't get me wrong Itachi should have gotten more supervision but he was already a grown adult in the eyes of Konoha, if he commited a crime he'd be held accountable.

Like I said it was a time of war and the sinobi world practices total warfare which means literally everyone is affected and will fight for their country. When I say Kakashi started killing at 6 I mean at an extremely young age. Afterall there's no official date. I want u to tell me what Fugaku was supposed to do??? Treat Itachi like God's gift to earth when they were literally kids  younger than him \\[Naruto and Gaara\\] being turned into living nukes??? Now I admit he kinda did drop the ball but considering he wanted Itachi to understand that in the world they live in they can't afford to show compassion to everyone it was a good lesson but horrible fucking timing. Fugaku should have waited longer but that's an idealist pov. Like I said Konoha, Danzo and Itachi himself worked him to the bone. I read the Itachi shinden and I never encountered anything that said that Fugaku was forcing Itachi on missions. Itachi wanted to be strong, what right did Fugaku have  to stop him ??? You're probably gonna say as his dad but think of it this way: what would happen if Fugaku a world renowned police officer was restricting his son from going stronger for Konoha's benefit?? It would look mighty sus and since Itachi was 1 in a kind prodigy it would be insulting to the village. When Itachi became a genin he was no longer under his parent's control. Similar to how 18 year old's can move out and their parents can't stop them, Itachi was considered an adult by Konoha. He didn't have to listen to his parents anymore, he still did ofc but they were plenty of times he showed open disobedience and his status as Anbu stopped any blame coming through.\n\nThe Uchiha are full of bs but they were legitimtely mad back then. While on paper they were supposed to be 1 of the most recongnized clans that just wouldn't come to be under Danzo. They were given police status just so they'd never think about reaching the top even though it was their right as 1 of the founding clans to have at least 1 of their members reach the top. It was that simple, if Hiruzen had had a backbone back then and told Danzo to fuck off and negotiated with the Uchiha to let Fugaku or sth become the next hokage the issues would have died. Afterall to make Minato look good, Fugaku's own accomplishments \\[ the moniker Wicked Eye Fugaku\\] was swept under the rug and that rightfully pissed off the Uchiha. That's like Sasuke and Naruto doing a project but Sasuke refuses to acknowledge Naru's involvement and not expecting him to be mad about it. Fugaku simply let it go. After the Kyuubi attack instead of someone literally attempting to work with the Uchiha to prove their innocence, the village said NAAH FAM Y'ALL ARE GUILTY AND ARE GONNA BE CONVICTED WITHOUT A TRIAL. They were being pushed to the outskirts of Konoha, being under constant surveillance even Sasuke who quite literally was the most innocent loving kid at the time, their kids being tormented for simply belonging to the clan \\[Itachi and Izumi\\] Now I'm not really sure if this is correct but I'm pretty sure Shisui got his mangekyo Sharigan at 7 so that means he had been put in a position where he unlocked and saw someone precious to him die so considering the fact that Shisui was showing mastery and such it's more than plausible that he was sent on the battlefield at 5 minimum. The Uchiha were being treated like some mfing outcasts, did Konoha really expect them not to get tired of the shit sooner or later. Fugaku was constantly telling the Uchiha to seek diplomacy until he just couldn't anymore without looking a bitch ass who'll accept insults to his family lying down. Danzo made sure the Uchiha were always harboring ill will towards Konoha until he had a legitimate reason to order Itachi to kill the clan. I mean if you're continously being shown disrespect by someone sooner or later, you'll return the favour. But the Uchiha were wrong on the part where they were willing to get the Kyuubi by removing it from Naru which would've killed him in order to get their respect back . That was wrong and cruel since Naru did literally nothing for them to justify it. Afterall they had Sasuke at the same age as Naru, they should have been more considerate",

Hiashi was 50/50. He treated Hina like a verbal puching bag and aggrevated her simple shyness into crippling social anxiety until 1 talk of their home life from Neji had her nearly having a mental breakdown in front of an audience. If that doesn't scream abuse then I don't know what does. Sure Fugaku had his moments and he did ccontribute to Sasuke getting a minor inferiority complex towards Itachi but when Sasuke did something good \\[doing fireball jutsu correctly\\] he congratulated him. He never forced Sasuke to hurt the people he loved, tried to assasinate him etc so yea it's barely but he's still better Rssa and Hiashi but worse than Shikaku and Inoichi who were standard fathers",

First of all it was a time of war, were kids as young as 6 were being sent on the battle field to kill \\[Kakashi\\]. Every person was needed. You couldn't afford to coddle your child. Also add the fact that Itachi was always into becoming the strongest for peace and as a result always pushed his limits to points were it would be counter productive not to let him help. Fugaku and Mikoto wanted Itachi to be a kid but Konoha and him said hell nah. If anyone can be considered abusive towards Itachi it's fucking Danzo who quite literally brainwashed him into commiting a massacre and Hiruzen was complicit by pointedly spending his time reading porn over negotiating with them. Fugaku knew what a coup de tat would do the clan so he avoided for as long as possible. The Uchiha were rightfully pissed off I mean they helped built Konoha but they were now being given minor clan status... Fugaku wanted Itachi to be strong enough to protect those he wished but Itachi was a 1nce in a generation that simply surpassed Fugaku and set a standard which Sasuke later struggled to reach let alone Fugaku himself. Add the fact that when you become a genin you're parents can no longer control your actions and FugaMiko trusted Itachi, he was left to foster his strength and bonds \\[his genin teammates, Shisui, Izumi etc\\] Now don't get me wrong Itachi should have gotten more supervision but he was already a grown adult in the eyes of Konoha, if he commited a crime he'd be held accountable.

                                            "body": "You seem to think I'm a Fugaku stan, HELL FUCKING NO. I'm neutral on the dude but I can see you're heavily biased here. Like I said it was a time of war and the sinobi world practices total warfare which means literally everyone is affected and will fight for their country. When I say Kakashi started killing at 6 I mean at an extremely young age. Afterall there's no official date. I want u to tell me what Fugaku was supposed to do??? Treat Itachi like God's gift to earth when they were literally kids  younger than him \\[Naruto and Gaara\\] being turned into living nukes??? Now I admit he kinda did drop the ball but considering he wanted Itachi to understand that in the world they live in they can't afford to show compassion to everyone it was a good lesson but horrible fucking timing. Fugaku should have waited longer but that's an idealist pov. Like I said Konoha, Danzo and Itachi himself worked him to the bone. I read the Itachi shinden and I never encountered anything that said that Fugaku was forcing Itachi on missions. Itachi wanted to be strong, what right did Fugaku have  to stop him ??? You're probably gonna say as his dad but think of it this way: what would happen if Fugaku a world renowned police officer was restricting his son from going stronger for Konoha's benefit?? It would look mighty sus and since Itachi was 1 in a kind prodigy it would be insulting to the village. When Itachi became a genin he was no longer under his parent's control. Similar to how 18 year old's can move out and their parents can't stop them, Itachi was considered an adult by Konoha. He didn't have to listen to his parents anymore, he still did ofc but they were plenty of times he showed open disobedience and his status as Anbu stopped any blame coming through.\n\nThe Uchiha are full of bs but they were legitimtely mad back then. While on paper they were supposed to be 1 of the most recongnized clans that just wouldn't come to be under Danzo. They were given police status just so they'd never think about reaching the top even though it was their right as 1 of the founding clans to have at least 1 of their members reach the top. It was that simple, if Hiruzen had had a backbone back then and told Danzo to fuck off and negotiated with the Uchiha to let Fugaku or sth become the next hokage the issues would have died. Afterall to make Minato look good, Fugaku's own accomplishments \\[ the moniker Wicked Eye Fugaku\\] was swept under the rug and that rightfully pissed off the Uchiha. That's like Sasuke and Naruto doing a project but Sasuke refuses to acknowledge Naru's involvement and not expecting him to be mad about it. Fugaku simply let it go. After the Kyuubi attack instead of someone literally attempting to work with the Uchiha to prove their innocence, the village said NAAH FAM Y'ALL ARE GUILTY AND ARE GONNA BE CONVICTED WITHOUT A TRIAL. They were being pushed to the outskirts of Konoha, being under constant surveillance even Sasuke who quite literally was the most innocent loving kid at the time, their kids being tormented for simply belonging to the clan \\[Itachi and Izumi\\] Now I'm not really sure if this is correct but I'm pretty sure Shisui got his mangekyo Sharigan at 7 so that means he had been put in a position where he unlocked and saw someone precious to him die so considering the fact that Shisui was showing mastery and such it's more than plausible that he was sent on the battlefield at 5 minimum. The Uchiha were being treated like some mfing outcasts, did Konoha really expect them not to get tired of the shit sooner or later. Fugaku was constantly telling the Uchiha to seek diplomacy until he just couldn't anymore without looking a bitch ass who'll accept insults to his family lying down. Danzo made sure the Uchiha were always harboring ill will towards Konoha until he had a legitimate reason to order Itachi to kill the clan. I mean if you're continously being shown disrespect by someone sooner or later, you'll return the favour. But the Uchiha were wrong on the part where they were willing to get the Kyuubi by removing it from Naru which would've killed him in order to get their respect back . That was wrong and cruel since Naru did literally nothing for them to justify it. Afterall they had Sasuke at the same age as Naru, they should have been more considerate",

First of all it was a time of war, were kids as young as 6 were being sent on the battle field to kill \\[Kakashi\\]. Every person was needed. You couldn't afford to coddle your child. Also add the fact that Itachi was always into becoming the strongest for peace and as a result always pushed his limits to points were it would be counter productive not to let him help. Fugaku and Mikoto wanted Itachi to be a kid but Konoha and him said hell nah. If anyone can be considered abusive towards Itachi it's fucking Danzo who quite literally brainwashed him into commiting a massacre and Hiruzen was complicit by pointedly spending his time reading porn over negotiating with them. Fugaku knew what a coup de tat would do the clan so he avoided for as long as possible. The Uchiha were rightfully pissed off I mean they helped built Konoha but they were now being given minor clan status... Fugaku wanted Itachi to be strong enough to protect those he wished but Itachi was a 1nce in a generation that simply surpassed Fugaku and set a standard which Sasuke later struggled to reach let alone Fugaku himself. Add the fact that when you become a genin you're parents can no longer control your actions and FugaMiko trusted Itachi, he was left to foster his strength and bonds \\[his genin teammates, Shisui, Izumi etc\\] Now don't get me wrong Itachi should have gotten more supervision but he was already a grown adult in the eyes of Konoha, if he commited a crime he'd be held accountable.

Like I said it was a time of war and the sinobi world practices total warfare which means literally everyone is affected and will fight for their country. When I say Kakashi started killing at 6 I mean at an extremely young age. Afterall there's no official date. I want u to tell me what Fugaku was supposed to do??? Treat Itachi like God's gift to earth when they were literally kids  younger than him \\[Naruto and Gaara\\] being turned into living nukes??? Now I admit he kinda did drop the ball but considering he wanted Itachi to understand that in the world they live in they can't afford to show compassion to everyone it was a good lesson but horrible fucking timing. Fugaku should have waited longer but that's an idealist pov. Like I said Konoha, Danzo and Itachi himself worked him to the bone. I read the Itachi shinden and I never encountered anything that said that Fugaku was forcing Itachi on missions. Itachi wanted to be strong, what right did Fugaku have  to stop him ??? You're probably gonna say as his dad but think of it this way: what would happen if Fugaku a world renowned police officer was restricting his son from going stronger for Konoha's benefit?? It would look mighty sus and since Itachi was 1 in a kind prodigy it would be insulting to the village. When Itachi became a genin he was no longer under his parent's control. Similar to how 18 year old's can move out and their parents can't stop them, Itachi was considered an adult by Konoha. He didn't have to listen to his parents anymore, he still did ofc but they were plenty of times he showed open disobedience and his status as Anbu stopped any blame coming through.\n\nThe Uchiha are full of bs but they were legitimtely mad back then. While on paper they were supposed to be 1 of the most recongnized clans that just wouldn't come to be under Danzo. They were given police status just so they'd never think about reaching the top even though it was their right as 1 of the founding clans to have at least 1 of their members reach the top. It was that simple, if Hiruzen had had a backbone back then and told Danzo to fuck off and negotiated with the Uchiha to let Fugaku or sth become the next hokage the issues would have died. Afterall to make Minato look good, Fugaku's own accomplishments \\[ the moniker Wicked Eye Fugaku\\] was swept under the rug and that rightfully pissed off the Uchiha. That's like Sasuke and Naruto doing a project but Sasuke refuses to acknowledge Naru's involvement and not expecting him to be mad about it. Fugaku simply let it go. After the Kyuubi attack instead of someone literally attempting to work with the Uchiha to prove their innocence, the village said NAAH FAM Y'ALL ARE GUILTY AND ARE GONNA BE CONVICTED WITHOUT A TRIAL. They were being pushed to the outskirts of Konoha, being under constant surveillance even Sasuke who quite literally was the most innocent loving kid at the time, their kids being tormented for simply belonging to the clan \\[Itachi and Izumi\\] Now I'm not really sure if this is correct but I'm pretty sure Shisui got his mangekyo Sharigan at 7 so that means he had been put in a position where he unlocked and saw someone precious to him die so considering the fact that Shisui was showing mastery and such it's more than plausible that he was sent on the battlefield at 5 minimum. The Uchiha were being treated like some mfing outcasts, did Konoha really expect them not to get tired of the shit sooner or later. Fugaku was constantly telling the Uchiha to seek diplomacy until he just couldn't anymore without looking a bitch ass who'll accept insults to his family lying down. Danzo made sure the Uchiha were always harboring ill will towards Konoha until he had a legitimate reason to order Itachi to kill the clan. I mean if you're continously being shown disrespect by someone sooner or later, you'll return the favour. But the Uchiha were wrong on the part where they were willing to get the Kyuubi by removing it from Naru which would've killed him in order to get their respect back . That was wrong and cruel since Naru did literally nothing for them to justify it. Afterall they had Sasuke at the same age as Naru, they should have been more considerate",

First of all it was a time of war, were kids as young as 6 were being sent on the battle field to kill \\[Kakashi\\]. Every person was needed. You couldn't afford to coddle your child. Also add the fact that Itachi was always into becoming the strongest for peace and as a result always pushed his limits to points were it would be counter productive not to let him help. Fugaku and Mikoto wanted Itachi to be a kid but Konoha and him said hell nah. If anyone can be considered abusive towards Itachi it's fucking Danzo who quite literally brainwashed him into commiting a massacre and Hiruzen was complicit by pointedly spending his time reading porn over negotiating with them. Fugaku knew what a coup de tat would do the clan so he avoided for as long as possible. The Uchiha were rightfully pissed off I mean they helped built Konoha but they were now being given minor clan status... Fugaku wanted Itachi to be strong enough to protect those he wished but Itachi was a 1nce in a generation that simply surpassed Fugaku and set a standard which Sasuke later struggled to reach let alone Fugaku himself. Add the fact that when you become a genin you're parents can no longer control your actions and FugaMiko trusted Itachi, he was left to foster his strength and bonds \\[his genin teammates, Shisui, Izumi etc\\] Now don't get me wrong Itachi should have gotten more supervision but he was already a grown adult in the eyes of Konoha, if he commited a crime he'd be held accountable. Fugaku was neglectful not abusive. Change my mind logically and diplomatically.",

Naruto definitely won that fight and it\u2019s pretty obvious to see naruto is stronger than sasuke",

            "body": "You seem to think I'm a Fugaku stan, HELL FUCKING NO. I'm neutral on the dude but I can see you're heavily biased here. Like I said it was a time of war and the sinobi world practices total warfare which means literally everyone is affected and will fight for their country. When I say Kakashi started killing at 6 I mean at an extremely young age. Afterall there's no official date. I want u to tell me what Fugaku was supposed to do??? Treat Itachi like God's gift to earth when they were literally kids  younger than him \\[Naruto and Gaara\\] being turned into living nukes??? Now I admit he kinda did drop the ball but considering he wanted Itachi to understand that in the world they live in they can't afford to show compassion to everyone it was a good lesson but horrible fucking timing. Fugaku should have waited longer but that's an idealist pov. Like I said Konoha, Danzo and Itachi himself worked him to the bone. I read the Itachi shinden and I never encountered anything that said that Fugaku was forcing Itachi on missions. Itachi wanted to be strong, what right did Fugaku have  to stop him ??? You're probably gonna say as his dad but think of it this way: what would happen if Fugaku a world renowned police officer was restricting his son from going stronger for Konoha's benefit?? It would look mighty sus and since Itachi was 1 in a kind prodigy it would be insulting to the village. When Itachi became a genin he was no longer under his parent's control. Similar to how 18 year old's can move out and their parents can't stop them, Itachi was considered an adult by Konoha. He didn't have to listen to his parents anymore, he still did ofc but they were plenty of times he showed open disobedience and his status as Anbu stopped any blame coming through.\n\nThe Uchiha are full of bs but they were legitimtely mad back then. While on paper they were supposed to be 1 of the most recongnized clans that just wouldn't come to be under Danzo. They were given police status just so they'd never think about reaching the top even though it was their right as 1 of the founding clans to have at least 1 of their members reach the top. It was that simple, if Hiruzen had had a backbone back then and told Danzo to fuck off and negotiated with the Uchiha to let Fugaku or sth become the next hokage the issues would have died. Afterall to make Minato look good, Fugaku's own accomplishments \\[ the moniker Wicked Eye Fugaku\\] was swept under the rug and that rightfully pissed off the Uchiha. That's like Sasuke and Naruto doing a project but Sasuke refuses to acknowledge Naru's involvement and not expecting him to be mad about it. Fugaku simply let it go. After the Kyuubi attack instead of someone literally attempting to work with the Uchiha to prove their innocence, the village said NAAH FAM Y'ALL ARE GUILTY AND ARE GONNA BE CONVICTED WITHOUT A TRIAL. They were being pushed to the outskirts of Konoha, being under constant surveillance even Sasuke who quite literally was the most innocent loving kid at the time, their kids being tormented for simply belonging to the clan \\[Itachi and Izumi\\] Now I'm not really sure if this is correct but I'm pretty sure Shisui got his mangekyo Sharigan at 7 so that means he had been put in a position where he unlocked and saw someone precious to him die so considering the fact that Shisui was showing mastery and such it's more than plausible that he was sent on the battlefield at 5 minimum. The Uchiha were being treated like some mfing outcasts, did Konoha really expect them not to get tired of the shit sooner or later. Fugaku was constantly telling the Uchiha to seek diplomacy until he just couldn't anymore without looking a bitch ass who'll accept insults to his family lying down. Danzo made sure the Uchiha were always harboring ill will towards Konoha until he had a legitimate reason to order Itachi to kill the clan. I mean if you're continously being shown disrespect by someone sooner or later, you'll return the favour. But the Uchiha were wrong on the part where they were willing to get the Kyuubi by removing it from Naru which would've killed him in order to get their respect back . That was wrong and cruel since Naru did literally nothing for them to justify it. Afterall they had Sasuke at the same age as Naru, they should have been more considerate",
