    "body": "This happened a few years ago with a former SB of mine.  Been playing in this world for a few years and had some nice and not so nice arrangements.  This particular SB checked all my boxes - she is a European former model in the states on an education visa that expired.  We hit it off the moment we met and was in her bed later that night.  After a few weeks noticed a pregnancy test stick in the bathroom and she mentioned that she always wanted a child and loved America.  My spidey senses went on overload and was particular in not cumming inside her.  After a year she knew that I didn't want any more children and she stopped responding to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to last year and she tells me she is pregnant and getting married to a man in his 60's (she in her 30's).  Well that didn't happen and she just delivered her child and is suing him for child support.  I dodged that one and don't need another child to be responsible for - have my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas this ever happened to other SD's?",

On my way to our first intimate date I realized I was out of condoms and ran into a convenience store to pick up a 3 pack. \n\nI noticed a strange look on her face when I put the condom on but paid it no attention. She ghosted me after that date and I was pretty upset about it...i really liked her. Over the next 6 months I kept an eye on her social media. She immediately started posting with an older guy and they were obviously a new couple. 7 months after I was with her she gave birth and they ended up in nasty custody/support battles. All pretty out in the open on facebook lol. \n\nMy determination was that she was pregnant when we met and was looking for a sucker. She found him. That little 3 pack of condoms was the best investment I ever made.",
