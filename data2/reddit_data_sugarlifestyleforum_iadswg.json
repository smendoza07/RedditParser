    "body": "I've been with my SB since she was 20. Then coronavirus happened but I was still able to celebrate her 21st with her.\n\nShe lives two hours away from my home, but I am in her town all the time for business. She has made my awful marriage, and the general ungratefulness I face at home bearable.\n\nI've paid her per meet only about once before we decided to have a sugar gf/ bf relationship. Since my projects in her town are increasing again, we're planning on her picking out an apartment that I will pay for, that I'll be living at when I'm in town.\n\nMy wife recently got coronavirus and that showed me how precious life was. I'm pretty fit but I realized that I could die tomorrow, and even though I have many regrets I can't do anything about, I don't regret my SB.\n\nAs such, I'm looking into making my SB a \" secret beneficiary\" when I die. It doesn't matter if we part ways. My family and I have so much, yet she's so humble, hardworking, grateful for even the smallest gestures.\n\nThe money I'd be putting into a trust for her would let her live at least a middle class life. I know she will be fine without it, but all the times where I can't be there for her, where people are telling her that the wife comes before her- it's compensation for that.\n\nI've told my closest buddy about it and I know we're close enough that he'd protect her interests if I was gone just because she's special to me.\n\nAnyways, I don't need a response- I just wanted to get this off my chest.\n\nI originally met secretly with an estate lawyer because I was sick of being used as an ATM by my grown daughters and son who feel entitled to my money. More and more parents are leaving their kids very little in the will and that's what I intend to do. And I can't say I won't cut them out entirely, for many reasons I don't want to divulge.\n\nBut SBs, just know that even if your SD can't be there for you all the time, you are appreciated beyond what any PPM can offer.",

That weekend I found out my cancer had returned. I gave her the option to not move in but she said we were going to fight this together. \n\nI had to get tested for covid before I started my tests for cancer. I came back positive for covid. They delayed my treatment as they told me until if I live through it.  I get my test back tomorrow to see if I am negative. If I am Thursday I do a Pet scan to see where they cancer has spread though out my body and a heart scan to see it has been damaged by the covid. If I am able to do chemo. If I will have a chance to live or will die soon.\n\nI am single with two grown children that I raised on my own and put them through college for professional careers. I gave then the ability to take care of themselves.\n\nWe have been lovers and friends being there for each other for longer than I was married the first time. I am making sure she is taken care of even if I don't make it.\n\nIn my will i disinherited my children who aren't in my life, filed a transfer on death deed for my home, put her name on two of my bank accounts so she will have money to live on until everything is liquidated that won't go through probate. \n\nMy brother is my DPOA for my business and sister is DPOA for my medical decisions.  Both of them know what my wishes are. My kids can't challenge anything.\n\nWhy would I not want to make sure she is taken care of when I am gone? We have changed each others lives in our time together. I have never loved or been loved like I am with her. \n\nDo what your heart tells you to do. If sounds like you love and care about her.

If he goes about it the way that he was planning to, putting the sugarbaby in a will, it\u2019s going to cause so much drama. From the wife finding out that he had a sugarbaby, to the sugarbaby getting more money than the kids(if she gets anything at all), it\u2019s just not gonna be worth all the drama. He needs to realize how selfish going about giving her the money this way is since he will be dead and won\u2019t have to worry about it.

Does it happen frequently? No? Thats because you dont need to be 25 to know right from wrong you idiot. 25 to reach full maturity? I guess we should forgive all 24 year old rapists then.

You need to make sure you're comfortable identifying assets which, as long as they remain in the trust, will not be part of your estate. This can be an important consideration if your estate has creditors with significant claims, or if your Will identifies a residuary Beneficiary whose situation you care a lot about. \n\nBut please: Revocable trust, not probate. People ask me about creating trusts all the time, and most of the time they're just overly concerned \u2014 the probate process is usually quite acceptable for their purposes. But this is one distinctive case where any competent estate attorney (once they're convinced that you genuinely want to make this transfer) should absolutely jump down your throat yelling \"REVOCABLE TRUST!\" until you acknowledge that you'll at least seriously consider the idea.\n\nRevocable trust. Ask any attorney, estate planner, financial planner. It needs to be first on your list of options to explore.",

If your relationship is strained it\u2019s on you as the father to try to make it better.  Take it from someone with a cheating father.

Additionally, if your estate is large enough to potentially be subject to federal estate tax, there are considerations you should be aware of that could cause issues with your spouse regardless of Texas state law. Some of these may apply even if you are not subject to estate tax at your death. I bring this up mostly because it sounds like one of your goals was possibly to do this in a way such that your family would never know. This is one way that could fail even if none of your heirs had any remedies available under state law.\n\nFind a good estate lawyer and a good CPA / financial planner who really know this stuff. Tell them your goal and let them present you 2 or 3 options that tick most of the boxes. Buddies at the bar (unless they are one of the above) and redditors are probably not going to get you the best answer on this!",

Does it happen frequently? No? Thats because you dont need to be 25 to know right from wrong you idiot. 25 to reach full maturity? I guess we should forgive all 24 year old rapists then.

You had a hand in their lives and so far we know that you\u2019re paying to cheat on their mother and you forgot to sign a permission slip for them. And now you want to leave them $50 each out of spite... Gee I wonder where they learned to hate from?  Why don\u2019t you show them some kindness and lead by example? If your relationship is strained it\u2019s on you as the father to try to make it better.  Take it from someone with a cheating father.  Even before it came out into the open I knew something was off.\n\nIt IS kind of you to be worried about your SB even after you\u2019re gone, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with leaving a small amount, but keep in mind she is literally being paid to be sweet and there for you, not out of the \u201chumble\u201d goodness of her heart.",

Does it happen frequently? No? Thats because you dont need to be 25 to know right from wrong you idiot. 25 to reach full maturity? I guess we should forgive all 24 year old rapists then.

Yes.  Have I seen or done it myself?  Certainly.  Can it be attributed solely to the kids or mother here?  I don't think its that simple.\n\nAnd so while OP here feels downtrodden and ignored, kids side with mother, I don't know enough to throw stone at either side at this point.

You dont have kids so you're not qualified to speak so vehemently on a topic you know so little about\n2. You post way too much on here and the aggressive and disrespectful way you speak, anonymously of course, indicates a pathology of sorts.  You need a hobby outside of reddit.
