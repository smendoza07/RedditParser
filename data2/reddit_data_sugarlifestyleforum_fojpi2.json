    "body": "So my guy & I FaceTime at least once every day. Even on the days we see each other. You could say we\u2019re pretty attached. It\u2019s always a light, fun conversation over FT. \n\nWe usually see each other once or twice a week but after nearly three weeks a part we were able to spend time together last night. (don\u2019t worry.. no cough, no fever, lots of hand washing) It was a wonderful night. So I knew we were still doing great in our relationship. \n\nTonight when he FaceTimed me, we got the hellos out of the way, and he says, \u201cOk, I need to say something to you and I need you to not reply at all until I get it all out. If you start talking I know I\u2019ll forgot some and I won\u2019t be able to finish everything I want to say.\u201d  You guys, I literally felt my stomach drop. I quickly considered hanging up because I was so afraid of what he was about to say. I tell him I\u2019m nervous but agree to not talk until he\u2019s finished. \n\nHe begins listing reasons why he is thankful for me, the things I do for him, and our relationship. He isn\u2019t just saying \u201cthanks for what you do.\u201d He is literally listing specific things. You can tell he\u2019s put a lot of thought into this. I swear I melted into the biggest pile of lovey mush ever. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling like the happiest kid in a candy store. \n\nI ended up not being able to keep my end of the promise up and I spoke. I couldn\u2019t help it. He later told me he didn\u2019t even get out half of what he wanted to say. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did to deserve this sexy, loving, caring, hilarious, hard-working man but I am so thankful for him. \n\nOk, thank you for attending my lovey, humble brag post. I know the sugar world is a little blah right now so I thought I\u2019d share something positive.",
