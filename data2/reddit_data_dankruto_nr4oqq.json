They also replaced their Daimyo around this time since they're the one that can actually declare war or attack other nations. Konoha probably demanded this after Sunagakure surrendered, which they were basically forced to do after they learned Orochimaru assassinated Rasa.\n\nGaara used that time to show he changed, but the council was still suspicious of him. They made him Kazekage as a way of keeping a better eye on him. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer as they say.\n\nAlso Yagura became Mizukage around the same age if not younger. Hiruzen said Itachi thought like a Hokage at a young age and became an anbu captain at 12 after all. Fugaku took him to a battlefield at 4  and he killed a wounded shinobi that tried to kill him right after he gave him water. Itachi must have been throwing kunai as a newborn to do that.",
