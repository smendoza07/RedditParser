Both the back and sides were also thinned out.\n\nIt was styled with the black Hairbond product (basically a paste/putty type thing) which was worked in damp and then blow dried backwards.\n\nI'd recommend you to show these pics if you want your barber to know what you want, and your barber should be good with scissor cuts and not just clippers because the clipper usage is just to clean up the edges and do the taper here.",

In the pre photo you have bad lighting, bad angle, crooked glasses, no smile, sad eyes. In the post photo you have straight glasses, nice lighting, nice angle, smile, happy and confident eyes. I 100% assure you that if you swapped the haircut in the photos you will find yourself better with the old haircut on the new photo. And you can notice this on 90% of pre-post photos. The only thing a haircut changes is how we feel, and when we feel better we try to look better, hence the better photos. Anyway good job man, keep smiling",

The picture on the left is like day 3 hair and it's got a lot of product buildup that's weighing things down. The right is day 1 hair and it's blowdried backwards with a prestyler (l'oreal elnett glam waves mousse, just a bit of it) and then a putty (the black hairbond), which stops it from clumping. It's also thinned out and the ends are cleaned up as part of the haircut.",

Both the back and sides were also thinned out.\n\nIt was styled with the black Hairbond product (basically a paste/putty type thing) which was worked in damp and then blow dried backwards.\n\nI'd recommend you to show these pics if you want your barber to know what you want, and your barber should be good with scissor cuts and not just clippers because the clipper usage is just to clean up the edges and do the taper here.",
