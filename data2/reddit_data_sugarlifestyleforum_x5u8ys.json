    "body": "TL;DR My SB gathered info about me that convinced her I should be paying more and insisted we renegotiate our arrangement. \n\nFirst post about my first SR. I work for a public company in the southeast, and I have been seeing my SB for a little over three months now. This has seemed like an ideal relationship all around. It took a long time to find the right one. I met her in the wild, and that made it feel even more perfect. \n\nAs a note, my part of our arrangement (allowance) has been on the generous side of standard for the Atlanta area, and my contributions have been like clockwork. \n\nWhen we met for dinner this weekend, however, something felt off. She was unusually quiet and kept giving me strange looks, sort of squinting at me, throughout the meal (think Gilbert Gottfried, only much prettier). I\u2019ve long since stopped trying to decode the female mind, but as we were finishing our main course, she suggested we order a cocktail and transition to a serious topic. We\u2019ve done so well together, and we seemed to have a great understanding, so I had no clue as to what was coming. I assumed she was about to break up, but that didn\u2019t really line up. Then she informed me she had been doing some research, and she produced some folded papers from her purse (which I bought her\u2026 the irony!). The gist is that she dug up public info on two stock sales I had made before we ever met. One was this year, and one was some time prior at a different company. \n\nNext thing I know, I am nursing my Old Fashioned while she is showing me the SEC Form 4s with the mien of someone who has uncovered evidence of a felony! I explained that anyone who knew my name could access this information. It\u2019s all public record, but the whole thing felt weird and damned unnerving. \n\nThen she began to cry and accused me of \u201cholding out\u201d on her. In reality, she has no clue what my financial situation is. I\u2019ve never discussed it with her, but I never poor-mouthed either. She just saw two stock sales and extrapolated recklessly from there. She announced that it is time for us to renegotiate our arrangement. Mind you, for the past several weeks, she has been saying that our arrangement was \u201cgenerous\u201d, \u201cperfect\u201d and had been \u201clife changing.\u201d Now she wants multiple times the amount we had agreed upon early in the summer. She \u201cjustified\u201d this by pointing out that it would only amount a fraction of a percentage of the stock sales. She called me a whale (Whatever. I\u2019m not). I asked her if she thought the restaurant should charge me more for our dinner as well. This served only to piss her off. I tried to reason with her, but she was obdurate. She quoted scripture at me. She alternated between laughing and crying. She asked me if I had any appreciation for how difficult this was for her. She obtusely hinted that she might show up at my work (I\u2019m not seriously worried about that). I had never seen this side of her before, and I mostly sat in stunned silence. At the end of the evening, my Little Man was no longer in the mood for recreation, so I suggested that she had given me a lot to think about, and I needed some time to do that. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think I can continue this arrangement now even if she reverses course. The hardest part was that I had developed real feelings for her, and I feel incredibly foolish right now. As they say, \u201cthere\u2019s no fool like an old fool.\u201d I don\u2019t know that this is the right lifestyle for me. I don\u2019t want to start over, sifting through a sea of rinsers and scammers, but I can\u2019t go forward with this one.",

The hardest part was that I had developed real feelings for her,\n\nThese are two of the most important statements you've made.  First, it's obvious you had developed real feelings for her -- if you hadn't, this wouldn't be so difficult.  All of us without feelings for her, we can see how ludicrous and manipulative her behavior is, how it's so solidly in red flag zone.  Only someone with feelings could struggle with it.  Which is totally natural and understandable!  It's when I catch feelings that the right decisions become so hard.\n\nWhat really resonates with me is \"I don't think I can continue this arrangement now even if she reverses course\".  That's a feeling I've learned to listen to, it's the always-accurate indicator something's gone really wrong.   When in doubt, listen to that feeling. I'm the same way that once someone goes way over the line, even if I'm struggling with how to react, if I get that \"how can I possibly pick this back up?\" feeling, I know going back will be disastrous, and not fair to me or her.",

Honestly she was probably in such a state that she didn\u2019t know wether to laugh about how much of a fool she feels she was thinking that you were giving the relationship your all as well or just sad that you looked her in the eyes and had the ability to help her more, but chose not to.\n\n**With that said, I still don\u2019t think the way she went about asking for an increased allowance was right. **\n\nThe papers she printed were more for her own assurance than anything else and it shows she was likely feeling a lot of anxiety and felt she needed the papers in case you tried to deny it, but those papers and her knowledge of your money shouldn\u2019t have been used as her justification for a raise in her allowance, but more so an assurance that you could afford an increased allowance. She completely came at this conversation the wrong way.\n\nBut what\u2019s done is done. Words were exchanged and this SR is toast.

She needed to have more of a connection than three months, probably years in my experience. In my experience, people that think this way can never see it any different. Everything thats been said is correct, you need to dump her. The question is the speed at which you do so and damage you can incur.\n\nTo me many if the things she said and her approach seems to indicate veiled threats, which I take to mean that you are suspectable to such things (a significant other maybe). If it is just generally being a top five in a public company but you are single, that is touch and go enough to be effective blackmail material. Let me interject with one thing. This is why I have never freestyled at all (although have considered it) as it is much more difficult to keep your identity hidden. But, that horse is out of the barn now. She seems to have gotten a little psycho and anyone that quotes scripture in my neck of the woods would absolutely be classified in that manner. But, be careful here if you have anything to lose. You should be trying to land this F-14 in the deck of the aircraft carrier in the middle of the Indian ocean, the waves are tough. You block and move on and she may try to do damage, and you slam into the front of the carrier. You meet her halfway for a month or two and then dump her for another reason and she feels emboldened by blackmailing you and you overshoot and put in the ocean on the high side. With crazy people, I tend to view always better to error on the short side and reduce exposure to them, ie cut and go. Long exposure to crazy people increases the chances of new crazy shit. But, only you can make that call. Good luck.",

I would sometimes ask for more to see what I can get away with. But after we agreed, then its my risk to re-negotiatie. I honestly wouldn't. Thats a very short relationship.\n\nHowever, I do suffer from BP1, I know when the mentals are not lined up you will witness multiple emotions on extremes. She's def going thru something and is in fight mode. Been there. I highly recommend you disconnect from her because a friend wouldnt talk to you like that or dig up crazy ass financial shit about u. \n\nIf I was interested in asking for a raise, I would probably do it mid-bj.

Following week she simply ghosted me. Ignored my whatsapp messages (yet never blocked me). So infuriating. She was the best. Never will know...BF came back on the scene? Another SD came along?

Following week she simply ghosted me. Ignored my whatsapp messages (yet never blocked me). So infuriating. She was the best. Never will know...BF came back on the scene? Another SD came along?
