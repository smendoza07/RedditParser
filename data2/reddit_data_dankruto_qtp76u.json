The episode ends with the reveal of his lifeless body bleeding out pinned to the side of the wall, then it immediately cuts to the credits that start with a group screaming \"HAPPY PEOPLE\" at the top of their lungs, and the whiplash that scene gives you is absolutely insane lol.!<",

Konan blindly followed Nagato and didn't even contest any decision in this massive terrorism. There were plenty of orphans who remained or turned good with some help and killing their ego. Konan and Nagato had Jiraiya, they refused any more help and started to corrupt themselves for a deluded purpose. That's the same with virtually every main villain in Naruto, they are all making up excuses in the very end when they're helpless, to justify the atrocities they committed, and for some reason some people sympathise with such despicable character. IRL you won't sympathise with a dictator who murdered people for power just because they had a chance for \"\"redemption\"\".",

Everything is relative and that's why the story (or at least its premise) is so interesting. \n\nThe sympathy for some villains in Naruto comes not from the idea that they are good people, but from the potential to show they are humans as well and not only killing machines. There is so much tragedy in that world, one can't help feeling bad for those who wanted to do the right things in the end. That's why some villains are deemed as worthy of sympathy and others aren't (e.g. Orochimaru who didn't deserve to run free in a world where the incarnation of good becomes the \"president\" of the most powerful nation)",

For instance Nagato blatantly tells that if he suffered, nobody else shall live happily and that everyone has to fail like him until the \"afterworld\", basically saviour complex than Obito, Madara, etc all have just because they're pieces of shit. \n\nThere's no moral relativity and the story makes it clear, Naruto is the light, the one who brings fools to \"redemption\", the one who brings peace to the world, the child of the prophecy, the real saviour. I have to say characters like Naruto have the right to sympathise with the subhuman trash villains just to make the evilness end but as a spectator there's really no room to sympathise with the Hitler's of Narutoverse.",

Konan and Nagato had Jiraiya, they refused any more help and started to corrupt themselves for a deluded purpose. That's the same with virtually every main villain in Naruto, they are all making up excuses in the very end when they're helpless, to justify the atrocities they committed, and for some reason some people sympathise with such despicable character. IRL you won't sympathise with a dictator who murdered people for power just because they had a chance for \"\"redemption\"\".",

They got fucked over big time by who they thought was their ally and that piece of shit Danzo. Of course they would become terrorists in the end. \n\nLook, if there is something clear about Naruto (the manga series), is that you can't expect someone to have a moral high ground in a story about freaking assassins. Everything is relative and that's why the story (or at least its premise) is so interesting. \n\nThe sympathy for some villains in Naruto comes not from the idea that they are good people, but from the potential to show they are humans as well and not only killing machines. There is so much tragedy in that world, one can't help feeling bad for those who wanted to do the right things in the end. That's why some villains are deemed as worthy of sympathy and others aren't (e.g. Orochimaru who didn't deserve to run free in a world where the incarnation of good becomes the \"president\" of the most powerful nation)",

Willingly and with all the self awareness wanting the world to suffer just so people are subject to the Akatsuki's stupid fantasies.\n\nSome fans are trying hard to justify their motives but each Naruto main villain's very purpose is the most ridiculous thing. For instance Nagato blatantly tells that if he suffered, nobody else shall live happily and that everyone has to fail like him until the \"afterworld\", basically saviour complex than Obito, Madara, etc all have just because they're pieces of shit. \n\nThere's no moral relativity and the story makes it clear, Naruto is the light, the one who brings fools to \"redemption\", the one who brings peace to the world, the child of the prophecy, the real saviour. I have to say characters like Naruto have the right to sympathise with the subhuman trash villains just to make the evilness end but as a spectator there's really no room to sympathise with the Hitler's of Narutoverse.",

Konan blindly followed Nagato and didn't even contest any decision in this massive terrorism. There were plenty of orphans who remained or turned good with some help and killing their ego. Konan and Nagato had Jiraiya, they refused any more help and started to corrupt themselves for a deluded purpose. That's the same with virtually every main villain in Naruto, they are all making up excuses in the very end when they're helpless, to justify the atrocities they committed, and for some reason some people sympathise with such despicable character. IRL you won't sympathise with a dictator who murdered people for power just because they had a chance for \"\"redemption\"\".",

They got fucked over big time by who they thought was their ally and that piece of shit Danzo. Of course they would become terrorists in the end. \n\nLook, if there is something clear about Naruto (the manga series), is that you can't expect someone to have a moral high ground in a story about freaking assassins. Everything is relative and that's why the story (or at least its premise) is so interesting. \n\nThe sympathy for some villains in Naruto comes not from the idea that they are good people, but from the potential to show they are humans as well and not only killing machines. There is so much tragedy in that world, one can't help feeling bad for those who wanted to do the right things in the end. That's why some villains are deemed as worthy of sympathy and others aren't (e.g. Orochimaru who didn't deserve to run free in a world where the incarnation of good becomes the \"president\" of the most powerful nation)",

Now was it good or just conceivable to turn their group into a terrorist organisation, kill citizens of their own nation, etc for the sake of creating a world of illusions? Willingly and with all the self awareness wanting the world to suffer just so people are subject to the Akatsuki's stupid fantasies.\n\nSome fans are trying hard to justify their motives but each Naruto main villain's very purpose is the most ridiculous thing. For instance Nagato blatantly tells that if he suffered, nobody else shall live happily and that everyone has to fail like him until the \"afterworld\", basically saviour complex than Obito, Madara, etc all have just because they're pieces of shit. \n\nThere's no moral relativity and the story makes it clear, Naruto is the light, the one who brings fools to \"redemption\", the one who brings peace to the world, the child of the prophecy, the real saviour. I have to say characters like Naruto have the right to sympathise with the subhuman trash villains just to make the evilness end but as a spectator there's really no room to sympathise with the Hitler's of Narutoverse.",

When they realized Tobi was manipulating them, she knew that Akatsuki has become something far different from what it was meant to be. The tragedy of her story comes from the fact that she is only an orphan who wanted to but never found the right path to save the world. She was a fool for following people blindly, yes, but Kishimoto never gave her an opportunity for redemption. \n\nHow cool would it be if she had survived and taken control of the hidden rain as the new leader? People already respected her, anyway.",

Now was it good or just conceivable to turn their group into a terrorist organisation, kill citizens of their own nation, etc for the sake of creating a world of illusions? Willingly and with all the self awareness wanting the world to suffer just so people are subject to the Akatsuki's stupid fantasies.\n\nSome fans are trying hard to justify their motives but each Naruto main villain's very purpose is the most ridiculous thing. For instance Nagato blatantly tells that if he suffered, nobody else shall live happily and that everyone has to fail like him until the \"afterworld\", basically saviour complex than Obito, Madara, etc all have just because they're pieces of shit. \n\nThere's no moral relativity and the story makes it clear, Naruto is the light, the one who brings fools to \"redemption\", the one who brings peace to the world, the child of the prophecy, the real saviour. I have to say characters like Naruto have the right to sympathise with the subhuman trash villains just to make the evilness end but as a spectator there's really no room to sympathise with the Hitler's of Narutoverse.",
