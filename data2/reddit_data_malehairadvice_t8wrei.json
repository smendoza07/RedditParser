It's hard to describe but you know it when you feel it. You start to get a little afraid to cut your hair because its going to become a whole thing. People start to know you as \"the guy with long hair\". You get the odd old-timer that gives you a weird about of shit for it. \n\nBasically, if you don't mind your hair being \"a thing\", keep it. If you'd rather just put your head down and work, go a bit more conservative.",

If not, might as well dress the way he wants and enjoy the boost to personal happiness. Maybe it even shows \u201ccommitment\u201d if he has long, neat hair.

You can look professional and sober with long hair anyways. You could even ask coworker\u2019s feedbacks and think about what you are comfortable with to be extra confident.",
