    "body": "On Star News coverage on the 10th, JSM was cast as the  heroine in \"Heesoo,\" one of the works of KBS 2TV's \"Drama Special  2021-TV Cinema,\" which is scheduled to air in the second half of this  year.\n\nHeesoo is a thriller about a  couple with a daughter. It is a one-act drama presented by KBS in the  form of a movie. JSM plays Joo-eun, the heroine of \"Heesoo.\" She is married to Park Sung-hoon, who plays Jung Tae-hoon.\n\nThrough this work, Jeon So-min will appear in a one-act KBS drama for the first time in three years since 'Drama Special - My Black History Wrong Note' in 2018. She also said that she is returning to KBS two years after her 'Her Birthday Letter', which aired in September 2019.\n\nJeon  So-min will briefly take off the comicality she showed in entertainment shows for a while and will show her seriousness as an actress in \"Heesoo\". Meanwhile,  JSM has been loved by viewers for appearing in entertainment  programs such as SBS 'Running Man' and tvN 'Sixth Sense 2'.\n\n[Source](https://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2021070912075484202)\n\n(I still remember Park Sunghoon as one of the weakest male guests in RM lmao)",
