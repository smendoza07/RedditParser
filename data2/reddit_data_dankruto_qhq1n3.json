By jumping into the conversation, most people who subscribe to the basic understanding of conversations, would understand that we would keep with the premise presented. You however, are trying to change the initial premise.\n\nOf course Talk-no-Jutsu isn't real. But if it isn't real, it isn't a ninshu either. So you're both trying to keep the the original premise and change the premise at the same time.\n\nSo, if we keep to the original premise and have some fun saying \"talk no jutsu\" is real, which you was doing when it benefited you, then it would be a retcon when Kishimoto added ninshu waaaay later in the story.\n\nSo, chill out and try to have some fun and stop trying to bring other people down.

Like come on its Shippuden now he's known for his shadow clones so they should expect it.\n\nThat being said though, in Nauruto when he's a wee kid. More than justified that most people he goes up against falls for this technique. He may rinse and repeat it as his \"go too\" but you're lying if you're telling yourself if you was in his shoes your go too wouldn't be a forbidden technique you know and next to no one else knows how to combat, or there muscle memory with how normal clones work won't allow them to combat it at least. :3",

What I'm arguing is the vast vast majority of everyone else doesn't know about those techniques because they are all forbidden.\n\nIt's like Nauruto asking someone in the hidden leaf village how he could do reanimation Jutsu that has only been shown by Chiyo, a member of a village hidden in the sand. Then a random shop owner being like \"oh yeah I know how to bring someone back from the dead. I just choose not too because it's a bit taxing on my joints to perform\" like come on. He obviously wouldn't know how to do it. Because it's forbidden and locked away in a scroll in each of the villages. having a whole population know it but choose to ignore using it is just silly. The scroll is to keep hold of the technique so it's not lost but to remove it from any form of training to it's appropriate village.\n\nOutside of main characters and plot necessity you'll have to prove it to me if you're going to contest the forbidden techniques being common knowledge to ninja's. I don't believe you just because you say so. I've never seen a source to back it up and frankly what I've stated so far hold up the most so far :)",

That, at the very least, shows that either the \"mass shadow clones\" jutsu is the same as the jutsu that can create a few clones that everyone knows or its not forbidden and he learned it from somewhere else which wasn't from Naruto. \n\nThroughout the show we also saw that shadow clones created without enough chakra just makes bad clones but has NEVER actually damaged the creator. \n\nNot to mention that your entire point relies upon a theory with no proof or mention in the show whatsoever. There was never any evidence that they were banned for using too much chakra that they would kill you - the amount of chakra just made it a hard technique to do.",

By jumping into the conversation, most people who subscribe to the basic understanding of conversations, would understand that we would keep with the premise presented. You however, are trying to change the initial premise.\n\nOf course Talk-no-Jutsu isn't real. But if it isn't real, it isn't a ninshu either. So you're both trying to keep the the original premise and change the premise at the same time.\n\nSo, if we keep to the original premise and have some fun saying \"talk no jutsu\" is real, which you was doing when it benefited you, then it would be a retcon when Kishimoto added ninshu waaaay later in the story.\n\nSo, chill out and try to have some fun and stop trying to bring other people down.

Then a random shop owner being like \"oh yeah I know how to bring someone back from the dead. I just choose not too because it's a bit taxing on my joints to perform\" like come on. He obviously wouldn't know how to do it. Because it's forbidden and locked away in a scroll in each of the villages. having a whole population know it but choose to ignore using it is just silly. The scroll is to keep hold of the technique so it's not lost but to remove it from any form of training to it's appropriate village.\n\nOutside of main characters and plot necessity you'll have to prove it to me if you're going to contest the forbidden techniques being common knowledge to ninja's. I don't believe you just because you say so. I've never seen a source to back it up and frankly what I've stated so far hold up the most so far :)",

That, at the very least, shows that either the \"mass shadow clones\" jutsu is the same as the jutsu that can create a few clones that everyone knows or its not forbidden and he learned it from somewhere else which wasn't from Naruto. \n\nThroughout the show we also saw that shadow clones created without enough chakra just makes bad clones but has NEVER actually damaged the creator. \n\nNot to mention that your entire point relies upon a theory with no proof or mention in the show whatsoever. There was never any evidence that they were banned for using too much chakra that they would kill you - the amount of chakra just made it a hard technique to do.",

Or let other people have fun.\n\nThe issue is you're trying to change the entire premise, move the goal posts. The premise wasn't \"is talk no Jutsu real\", it was a fun little joke saying \"talk no Jutsu is a genjutsu\". By jumping into the conversation, most people who subscribe to the basic understanding of conversations, would understand that we would keep with the premise presented. You however, are trying to change the initial premise.\n\nOf course Talk-no-Jutsu isn't real. But if it isn't real, it isn't a ninshu either. So you're both trying to keep the the original premise and change the premise at the same time.\n\nSo, if we keep to the original premise and have some fun saying \"talk no jutsu\" is real, which you was doing when it benefited you, then it would be a retcon when Kishimoto added ninshu waaaay later in the story.\n\nSo, chill out and try to have some fun and stop trying to bring other people down.

Then a random shop owner being like \"oh yeah I know how to bring someone back from the dead. I just choose not too because it's a bit taxing on my joints to perform\" like come on. He obviously wouldn't know how to do it. Because it's forbidden and locked away in a scroll in each of the villages. having a whole population know it but choose to ignore using it is just silly. The scroll is to keep hold of the technique so it's not lost but to remove it from any form of training to it's appropriate village.\n\nOutside of main characters and plot necessity you'll have to prove it to me if you're going to contest the forbidden techniques being common knowledge to ninja's. I don't believe you just because you say so. I've never seen a source to back it up and frankly what I've stated so far hold up the most so far :)",

Or let other people have fun.\n\nThe issue is you're trying to change the entire premise, move the goal posts. The premise wasn't \"is talk no Jutsu real\", it was a fun little joke saying \"talk no Jutsu is a genjutsu\". By jumping into the conversation, most people who subscribe to the basic understanding of conversations, would understand that we would keep with the premise presented. You however, are trying to change the initial premise.\n\nOf course Talk-no-Jutsu isn't real. But if it isn't real, it isn't a ninshu either. So you're both trying to keep the the original premise and change the premise at the same time.\n\nSo, if we keep to the original premise and have some fun saying \"talk no jutsu\" is real, which you was doing when it benefited you, then it would be a retcon when Kishimoto added ninshu waaaay later in the story.\n\nSo, chill out and try to have some fun and stop trying to bring other people down. It's a sub about Naruto, not something that actually matters.",

Then a random shop owner being like \"oh yeah I know how to bring someone back from the dead. I just choose not too because it's a bit taxing on my joints to perform\" like come on. He obviously wouldn't know how to do it. Because it's forbidden and locked away in a scroll in each of the villages. having a whole population know it but choose to ignore using it is just silly. The scroll is to keep hold of the technique so it's not lost but to remove it from any form of training to it's appropriate village.\n\nOutside of main characters and plot necessity you'll have to prove it to me if you're going to contest the forbidden techniques being common knowledge to ninja's. I don't believe you just because you say so. I've never seen a source to back it up and frankly what I've stated so far hold up the most so far :)",

That, at the very least, shows that either the \"mass shadow clones\" jutsu is the same as the jutsu that can create a few clones that everyone knows or its not forbidden and he learned it from somewhere else which wasn't from Naruto. \n\nThroughout the show we also saw that shadow clones created without enough chakra just makes bad clones but has NEVER actually damaged the creator. \n\nNot to mention that your entire point relies upon a theory with no proof or mention in the show whatsoever. There was never any evidence that they were banned for using too much chakra that they would kill you - the amount of chakra just made it a hard technique to do.",

The premise wasn't \"is talk no Jutsu real\", it was a fun little joke saying \"talk no Jutsu is a genjutsu\". By jumping into the conversation, most people who subscribe to the basic understanding of conversations, would understand that we would keep with the premise presented. You however, are trying to change the initial premise.\n\nOf course Talk-no-Jutsu isn't real. But if it isn't real, it isn't a ninshu either. So you're both trying to keep the the original premise and change the premise at the same time.\n\nSo, if we keep to the original premise and have some fun saying \"talk no jutsu\" is real, which you was doing when it benefited you, then it would be a retcon when Kishimoto added ninshu waaaay later in the story.\n\nSo, chill out and try to have some fun and stop trying to bring other people down.

What I'm arguing is the vast vast majority of everyone else doesn't know about those techniques because they are all forbidden.\n\nIt's like Nauruto asking someone in the hidden leaf village how he could do reanimation Jutsu that has only been shown by Chiyo, a member of a village hidden in the sand. Then a random shop owner being like \"oh yeah I know how to bring someone back from the dead. I just choose not too because it's a bit taxing on my joints to perform\" like come on. He obviously wouldn't know how to do it. Because it's forbidden and locked away in a scroll in each of the villages. having a whole population know it but choose to ignore using it is just silly. The scroll is to keep hold of the technique so it's not lost but to remove it from any form of training to it's appropriate village.\n\nOutside of main characters and plot necessity you'll have to prove it to me if you're going to contest the forbidden techniques being common knowledge to ninja's. I don't believe you just because you say so. I've never seen a source to back it up and frankly what I've stated so far hold up the most so far :)",
