Psychopathy involves more of a disconnect from reality, which is why some of their behaviors are different.

It was absolutely about balance for me \u2026 and I think that \"not clingy\" balance led her to realize that if she really wanted this to be more than a SR she was going to need to express that .. the old \"woman chooses the man\" scenario I'm constantly telling single men to embrace. Women have always chosen men. The better we understand that the better off we are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm honestly spoiling her more as a GF than I did as a SB \u2026 it's just not structured in a concrete way. She's noticed that and has become more intimate and loving and seductive than I've ever had from any GF. If you get a chance to take it in that direction - and it sounds like you are single - I fully recommend it - just tread slowly. One \"challenge\" we had was her coming clean about all the \"outside the SR\" activities she was involved in \u2026 as that was her time to be able to experiment with others and compare what she was feeling and getting from Vanilla BFs her own age vs. me. As \"odd\" as it was to hear her stories it was heart warming to see she was genuinely concerned and scared I would break it off from her by knowing the truth. I had to explain to her that once you get to my age \u2026 you don't care and don't ask how many people a woman has been with \u2026 it's irrelevant and many have gone through a \"whore\" phase anyway. What matters is sexual cleanliness, loyalty, respect, love and all the good things that make a relationship work. I oddly think we have a better chance than I do with women my own age because it a weird way I am mentoring/teaching her what a relationship with a \"man\" can be like, and the young culture is so toxic and void of \"real men\" and \"real love\" that they don't know what that means \u2026 but they can still sense in their Human DNA a longing for a man making them safe and taking care of them \u2026 without possession. I've had to fight off a lot of \"projecting\" from her, but luckily I have suffered from \"projecting\" in my past and worked on it immensely and finally got it under control .. within reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice to hear your story. We had a lovely dinner last night and when she needed to go home for a wedding tomorrow vs. a sleepover at my place \u2026 we did what any young (well her, not me) couple would do and hopped in the back of my car for some late-night fun in a parking lot. Took me back to my 20s \u2026 and I'm not sure why I ever left that mentality \u2026 except the women got old and boring and I'm still a young buck trapped in this older, wiser body.",

There's nothing wrong with them, they just tend to think of themselves first and more empathetic people screw themselves over by buying into the shallow friendships they think they're creating with these people. My younger sister is a diagnosed Sociopath and let me tell you she's a force to be reckoned with. She is endlessly charming, saying whatever she decides another person needs to hear to get her way. She is physically and emotionally incapable of such bothersome feelings as remorse and empathy, this makes it easy for her to step on people full force and not even stop to consider she may have crushed them. This in no way makes her a bad person though. She absolutely understands right from wrong and when she chooses to help someone for whatever future gain she sees for herself that person always benefits handsomely, so long as they stay on her good side. She's also extremely controlling but she has this weird way of convincing people it's what they want and what's best for their current situation. \n\nNow growing up alongside her I know all her little tricks and the thought processes that go into them. Once you understand the psychology of someone who literally lacks a massive chunk of their own humanity and cant help it you understand how to bob and weave around their, often reflexive, manipulative behaviors. \n\nAgain, I cannot stress this enough, sociopaths and psychopaths are not inherently bad people. They are often completely misunderstood, demonized and stereotyped individuals who in some cases just didn't get the right treatment as children. Empathy can be taught and they, more than most people, are vividly aware that manipulating neurotypical and overly empathetic people is not only hilariously easy but can have profound effects on that person for the rest of their lives. They'll still do it because narcissism is a kind of sister trait to socio and psychopathy and it demands they put themselves first.\n\nDont necessarily fear them. Just make sure you identify them quickly and keep them at arms length emotionally and mentally. They really wont be hurt if you dont want to be best friends. They're their own best friends most of the time. Do also be aware that these people can be very cold and calculating but sociopaths in particular have an impulsive streak that can get them seriously hurt. If you care about a sociopath, as I care for my little sister, be there when everything comes crashing down because even if they dont outwardly say thank you they're going to remember that you had their back when no one else did.",

The ability to not want to stop til it's solved is an autistic behavior. So a fair amount of them probably have high functioning autism. \n\nOr OCD. OCD can be wonderful if it's utilized for a specific purpose and mild enough to be easily redirected. Often however it isn't and becomes terrifying like with Howard Hughes. His focus allowed him to do amazing things it just got really bad for him.",

It was absolutely about balance for me \u2026 and I think that \"not clingy\" balance led her to realize that if she really wanted this to be more than a SR she was going to need to express that .. the old \"woman chooses the man\" scenario I'm constantly telling single men to embrace. Women have always chosen men. The better we understand that the better off we are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm honestly spoiling her more as a GF than I did as a SB \u2026 it's just not structured in a concrete way. She's noticed that and has become more intimate and loving and seductive than I've ever had from any GF. If you get a chance to take it in that direction - and it sounds like you are single - I fully recommend it - just tread slowly. One \"challenge\" we had was her coming clean about all the \"outside the SR\" activities she was involved in \u2026 as that was her time to be able to experiment with others and compare what she was feeling and getting from Vanilla BFs her own age vs. me. As \"odd\" as it was to hear her stories it was heart warming to see she was genuinely concerned and scared I would break it off from her by knowing the truth. I had to explain to her that once you get to my age \u2026 you don't care and don't ask how many people a woman has been with \u2026 it's irrelevant and many have gone through a \"whore\" phase anyway. What matters is sexual cleanliness, loyalty, respect, love and all the good things that make a relationship work. I oddly think we have a better chance than I do with women my own age because it a weird way I am mentoring/teaching her what a relationship with a \"man\" can be like, and the young culture is so toxic and void of \"real men\" and \"real love\" that they don't know what that means \u2026 but they can still sense in their Human DNA a longing for a man making them safe and taking care of them \u2026 without possession. I've had to fight off a lot of \"projecting\" from her, but luckily I have suffered from \"projecting\" in my past and worked on it immensely and finally got it under control .. within reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice to hear your story. We had a lovely dinner last night and when she needed to go home for a wedding tomorrow vs. a sleepover at my place \u2026 we did what any young (well her, not me) couple would do and hopped in the back of my car for some late-night fun in a parking lot. Took me back to my 20s \u2026 and I'm not sure why I ever left that mentality \u2026 except the women got old and boring and I'm still a young buck trapped in this older, wiser body.",

It was absolutely about balance for me \u2026 and I think that \"not clingy\" balance led her to realize that if she really wanted this to be more than a SR she was going to need to express that .. the old \"woman chooses the man\" scenario I'm constantly telling single men to embrace. Women have always chosen men. The better we understand that the better off we are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm honestly spoiling her more as a GF than I did as a SB \u2026 it's just not structured in a concrete way. She's noticed that and has become more intimate and loving and seductive than I've ever had from any GF. If you get a chance to take it in that direction - and it sounds like you are single - I fully recommend it - just tread slowly. One \"challenge\" we had was her coming clean about all the \"outside the SR\" activities she was involved in \u2026 as that was her time to be able to experiment with others and compare what she was feeling and getting from Vanilla BFs her own age vs. me. As \"odd\" as it was to hear her stories it was heart warming to see she was genuinely concerned and scared I would break it off from her by knowing the truth. I had to explain to her that once you get to my age \u2026 you don't care and don't ask how many people a woman has been with \u2026 it's irrelevant and many have gone through a \"whore\" phase anyway. What matters is sexual cleanliness, loyalty, respect, love and all the good things that make a relationship work. I oddly think we have a better chance than I do with women my own age because it a weird way I am mentoring/teaching her what a relationship with a \"man\" can be like, and the young culture is so toxic and void of \"real men\" and \"real love\" that they don't know what that means \u2026 but they can still sense in their Human DNA a longing for a man making them safe and taking care of them \u2026 without possession. I've had to fight off a lot of \"projecting\" from her, but luckily I have suffered from \"projecting\" in my past and worked on it immensely and finally got it under control .. within reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice to hear your story. We had a lovely dinner last night and when she needed to go home for a wedding tomorrow vs. a sleepover at my place \u2026 we did what any young (well her, not me) couple would do and hopped in the back of my car for some late-night fun in a parking lot. Took me back to my 20s \u2026 and I'm not sure why I ever left that mentality \u2026 except the women got old and boring and I'm still a young buck trapped in this older, wiser body.",

            "body": "That's great to hear. I often feel isolated in my story. It was absolutely about balance for me \u2026 and I think that \"not clingy\" balance led her to realize that if she really wanted this to be more than a SR she was going to need to express that .. the old \"woman chooses the man\" scenario I'm constantly telling single men to embrace. Women have always chosen men. The better we understand that the better off we are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm honestly spoiling her more as a GF than I did as a SB \u2026 it's just not structured in a concrete way. She's noticed that and has become more intimate and loving and seductive than I've ever had from any GF. If you get a chance to take it in that direction - and it sounds like you are single - I fully recommend it - just tread slowly. One \"challenge\" we had was her coming clean about all the \"outside the SR\" activities she was involved in \u2026 as that was her time to be able to experiment with others and compare what she was feeling and getting from Vanilla BFs her own age vs. me. As \"odd\" as it was to hear her stories it was heart warming to see she was genuinely concerned and scared I would break it off from her by knowing the truth. I had to explain to her that once you get to my age \u2026 you don't care and don't ask how many people a woman has been with \u2026 it's irrelevant and many have gone through a \"whore\" phase anyway. What matters is sexual cleanliness, loyalty, respect, love and all the good things that make a relationship work. I oddly think we have a better chance than I do with women my own age because it a weird way I am mentoring/teaching her what a relationship with a \"man\" can be like, and the young culture is so toxic and void of \"real men\" and \"real love\" that they don't know what that means \u2026 but they can still sense in their Human DNA a longing for a man making them safe and taking care of them \u2026 without possession. I've had to fight off a lot of \"projecting\" from her, but luckily I have suffered from \"projecting\" in my past and worked on it immensely and finally got it under control .. within reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice to hear your story. We had a lovely dinner last night and when she needed to go home for a wedding tomorrow vs. a sleepover at my place \u2026 we did what any young (well her, not me) couple would do and hopped in the back of my car for some late-night fun in a parking lot. Took me back to my 20s \u2026 and I'm not sure why I ever left that mentality \u2026 except the women got old and boring and I'm still a young buck trapped in this older, wiser body.",
