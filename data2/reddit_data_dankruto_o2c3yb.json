He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time. Remember that Itachi kept it activated near constantly, and he's never had chakra levels even close to Sasuke's.",

There\u2019s no indication that chakra in anyway has innately different \u201cqualities\u201d. At least, not Sasuke\u2019s. We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time. Remember that Itachi kept it activated near constantly, and he's never had chakra levels even close to Sasuke's.",

There\u2019s no indication that chakra in anyway has innately different \u201cqualities\u201d. At least, not Sasuke\u2019s. We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time.

At least, not Sasuke\u2019s. We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time. Remember that Itachi kept it activated near constantly, and he's never had chakra levels even close to Sasuke's.",

At least, not Sasuke\u2019s. We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time.

At least, not Sasuke\u2019s. We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time. Remember that Itachi kept it activated near constantly, and he's never had chakra levels even close to Sasuke's.",

At least, not Sasuke\u2019s. We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

He pulled on the Curse Mark because he tried to use more chakra than he had. Literally. Hence the flashback to Kakashi saying don\u2019t try to use Chidori three times a day, then Sasuke doing as such, running out of chakra, and then the Curse Mark helping him pick up the slack. This is all extremely explicit.\n\nThe reason the curse mark deforms is because it keeps producing Nature chakra even past the natural boundaries. Naruto has no changes not because of how much chakra he has, but rather because he generates the perfect amount of Senjutsu for the amount of chakra he has, which Jiraiya couldn\u2019t. Jiraiya could also be featureless, he just never mastered Sage Mode. The mere fact that the Curse Mark can deform it\u2019s users so much is *proof* that the Curse Mark doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s chakra as a base to give them more Nature chakra.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time. Remember that Itachi kept it activated near constantly, and he's never had chakra levels even close to Sasuke's.",

We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

Some translations are a bit vague about this, but it's Kabuto was referring to the quality of his chakra, not the quantity - indeed, this is how some fansubs have interpreted it, and no translation that I'm aware of has taken it to mean that he still had a lot of chakra left. I suspect he meant it was strong in the same way that Killing Intent is - an indicator for threat potential rather than an actual threat.\n\n2. Even if he is referring to quantity, we don't actually know how much time has passed between the battle and the scene in the lair, but going by scenes that occur, it's implied that it was at least a day. This is enough time for him to recover some, especially with the Curse mark, and for Kabuto to have administered aid, food pills etc (since he was the one who took him to the base). This is supported by the fact that in the anime, he's wearing different robes and shows no sign of injury or exhaustion (despite looking like that when he leaves the valley).\n\n>*and* he flashed his Sharingan\n\nHe did not do this - he just glares at him.\n\n>which isn\u2019t exactly cheap on chakra.\n\nIt's expensive for non-Uchiha - as long as he's not redlining, it wouldn't be a big deal for someone of Sasuke's calibre to activate it for a short time.

We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",

We get references that non-human and barely human characters have chakra of a different \u201cquality\u201d such as the density of Kurama and Orochimaru\u2019s, but Kurama is the closest thing to God still around and Orochimaru is more charitably described as a living pile of mythical snakes that has sentience than as a human. Hell, Sasuke even refers to his powers as the of \u201cThe White Snake\u201d, referencing the mythical white snake we are told is a symbol of immortality.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sasuke\u2019s interaction with Orochimaru takes place later and every interaction it\u2019s soon after the battle. In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes. It\u2019s still got the wing tears *and* the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed, which did take place that very night.\n\nThe Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive. In Boruto, it\u2019s specifically called Sarada\u2019s major weakness. Hell, look at the Great Snake Escape. Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was, but still had enough chakra to suppress Orochimaru completely, which indicates Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.",

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha.

This extends to groups of people as well - people from the same clan are noted to have similar chakra signatures to each other. Further, there has been many times throughout the series when a person's chakra has been referred to as \"dark\", \"disgusting\", \"warm\", \"cold\", etc. - it's implied that emotional state and general personality has a bearing on how a person's chakra is perceived.\n\n>At least, not Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nKurama explicitly called out Sasuke's chakra as being darker than his own upon first meeting him, even comparing it to Madara himself. Karin has made a similar observation about Sasuke's chakra, calling it \"cold\", while describing Naruto's as \"warm and bright\".\n\n>In the manga, Sasuke *isn\u2019t* wearing a change of clothes.\n\n[Yes, he is.](https://mangadex.org/chapter/a713f9cf-6030-47d1-bb9c-02f6ea66d2e6) On page 3, he's clearly wearing a robe, rather than the shirt and shorts he fought Naruto in.\n\n>the scene takes place before we get the scenes with the Retrieval squad being healed\n\nNo, it doesn't - it takes place after everyone has healed and started their training. Healing takes place over 235, 236 and 237, Sasuke enters the lair in 238. See for yourself using the link above.\n\n>The Sharingan is denoted as being very chakra intensive.\n\nAgain, this is only for non-Uchiha - no Uchiha has ever been shown to struggle with the chakra demands of the baseline Sharingan; I can't comment on Sarada, since I haven't read or watched Boruto, but this was how it was portrayed in the original series.\n\n>Sasuke powered down his Sharingan because of how tired he was\n\nI don't remember that scene, but he could very well have been talking about the strain it caused rather than the chakra usage - usage of the Sharingan has been shown to put a significant strain on the user outside of simple chakra drain. This is especially obvious when it comes to the Mangekyou - using it causes pain regardless of how much chakra the user has left - but it's evident for the regular Sharingan as well.\n\n>Sasuke still had more chakra than *Kabuto\u2019s entire reserve* when he felt the need to turn off the Sharingan.\n\nIf the Sharingan truly required that much chakra, there is no way Itachi would have been able to keep it permanently active like he did, and the Uchiha as a whole would have been far less dangerous if they needed chakra comparable to Sasuke's to use it effectively. Again, apart from Sarada, not a single Uchiha has been shown to be that greatly impacted by the Sharingan's chakra drain.",

Chakra has different qualities and types and colours etc. What I meant was that Sasuke\u2019s is never said to be inherently a superior chakra to any others. We hear many times he\u2019s got a fuck ton of chakra, but never anything implying that it\u2019s in anyway uniquely powerful or dense. Even Kabuto here comments on it\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d, which has always been used more to comment on the amount of chakra a person has, rather than it\u2019s inherent characteristics.\n\nI\u2019ll concede the timing there, that\u2019s my mistake. However I\u2019d point out Sasuke\u2019s still got marks and bags under his eyes, implying it\u2019s probably the following morning, since he had to travel over the night and not get any rest so his chakra wouldn\u2019t have recovered nearly enough to go from, \u201ceasy Shino stomp\u201d to \u201cfucking terrify Kabuto\u201d.\n\nThis relies on Itachi keeping his Sharingan permanently active which\u2026 he didn\u2019t. The only reason he\u2019s always got it active when we see him is because he\u2019s fighting high tier opponents and his Sharingan is his main weapon. Whenever he\u2019s not in active combat or actively using Genjutsu, such as the one he cast on that chick to seduce Jiraiya, he doesn\u2019t have it on.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re explicitly told that the Sharingan is exceedingly rare even among Uchiha. And the only ones we see use it in extended combat are all the types that are comparable to Sasuke.\n\nNow obviously you don\u2019t need to be carrying around a full Jounin+ reserve just to use it, but the fact that Sasuke had that much chakra and still felt the need to turn it off at least gives the impression that unless you are one of the rare few who has the reserves to walk around with it on, you wouldn\u2019t. The moment he drops the Genjutsu on Manda, he immediately collapses and drops his Sharingan, but is *still* supressing Orochimaru. Using the Sharingan is chakra intensive. It\u2019s obvious. My personal theory is that awakening the Mangekyo also helps reduce the cost of the base Sharingan, just like EMS reduces the chakra cost of the MS techniques. Because Sasuke became a hell of a lot more liberal with the use of even the base Sharingan after the Itachi fight.",
