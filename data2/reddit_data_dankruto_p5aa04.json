And that's another thing; she's incredibly skilled and intelligent in the field of medical jutsu as well as combat, and those are two things I find extremely impressive and attractive in equal measure. I love the sound of her fist when it made contact with Orochimaru's face and I could see the bone crunch under the force of it, the impact was so satisfying. So yeah I love Tsunade and I would totally want her to choke me out and toss me around like a ragdoll because I know she'd be able to heal me if anything went wrong while we were going at it. I just have a soft spot for women that could snap me in half if they wanted to, ya know?",

I did check into a steam the other day though and he spent the first like 10-15 minutes going over me screen shotting him simping on Twitter. Like I got a screen shot of him simping on Twitter for project melody and it started a whole chain of people cropping the tweet. Even Briggs went over it live on stream and told a story about how nux downloaded apex to simp for another vtuber instead of play with the boys. Honestly one of the proudest moments of my life",

And that's another thing; she's incredibly skilled and intelligent in the field of medical jutsu as well as combat, and those are two things I find extremely impressive and attractive in equal measure. I love the sound of her fist when it made contact with Orochimaru's face and I could see the bone crunch under the force of it, the impact was so satisfying. So yeah I love Tsunade and I would totally want her to choke me out and toss me around like a ragdoll because I know she'd be able to heal me if anything went wrong while we were going at it. I just have a soft spot for women that could snap me in half if they wanted to, ya know?",

And how did they create the tracks to spread to the leaf to the sand and beyond because the sand is 3 days away running. The ninja tools make some sense though. Like they you need a scroll for them and scroll sealing is nothing new and I can definitely see ninja tools being something after maybe 10-15 years of development and planning. Maybe even less to be honest",

I did check into a steam the other day though and he spent the first like 10-15 minutes going over me screen shotting him simping on Twitter.

Even Briggs went over it live on stream and told a story about how nux downloaded apex to simp for another vtuber instead of play with the boys. Honestly one of the proudest moments of my life",

And that's another thing; she's incredibly skilled and intelligent in the field of medical jutsu as well as combat, and those are two things I find extremely impressive and attractive in equal measure. I love the sound of her fist when it made contact with Orochimaru's face and I could see the bone crunch under the force of it, the impact was so satisfying. So yeah I love Tsunade and I would totally want her to choke me out and toss me around like a ragdoll because I know she'd be able to heal me if anything went wrong while we were going at it. I just have a soft spot for women that could snap me in half if they wanted to, ya know?",

Before that the last video I watched was probally around the vtuber reveal and among us videos. But when he went to pure meme content that's when I stopped. Like the memes aren't funny. The Billy memes like 189 iq and some of that is funny, but almost no other memes. I did check into a steam the other day though and he spent the first like 10-15 minutes going over me screen shotting him simping on Twitter. Like I got a screen shot of him simping on Twitter for project melody and it started a whole chain of people cropping the tweet. Even Briggs went over it live on stream and told a story about how nux downloaded apex to simp for another vtuber instead of play with the boys. Honestly one of the proudest moments of my life",

And that's another thing; she's incredibly skilled and intelligent in the field of medical jutsu as well as combat, and those are two things I find extremely impressive and attractive in equal measure. I love the sound of her fist when it made contact with Orochimaru's face and I could see the bone crunch under the force of it, the impact was so satisfying. So yeah I love Tsunade and I would totally want her to choke me out and toss me around like a ragdoll because I know she'd be able to heal me if anything went wrong while we were going at it. I just have a soft spot for women that could snap me in half if they wanted to, ya know?",

I did check into a steam the other day though and he spent the first like 10-15 minutes going over me screen shotting him simping on Twitter.

And that's another thing; she's incredibly skilled and intelligent in the field of medical jutsu as well as combat, and those are two things I find extremely impressive and attractive in equal measure. I love the sound of her fist when it made contact with Orochimaru's face and I could see the bone crunch under the force of it, the impact was so satisfying. So yeah I love Tsunade and I would totally want her to choke me out and toss me around like a ragdoll because I know she'd be able to heal me if anything went wrong while we were going at it. I just have a soft spot for women that could snap me in half if they wanted to, ya know?",

I did check into a steam the other day though and he spent the first like 10-15 minutes going over me screen shotting him simping on Twitter. Like I got a screen shot of him simping on Twitter for project melody and it started a whole chain of people cropping the tweet. Even Briggs went over it live on stream and told a story about how nux downloaded apex to simp for another vtuber instead of play with the boys. Honestly one of the proudest moments of my life",
