At that time RM was going through it's worst era, low ratings, morale & strange concepts. Kang Ho Dong was suppose to replace them but declined after the firings backlash. After being apologized to, KJK convinced the whole cast to stay to continue the show, the new head PD was brought in & he added JSM & YSC with the agreement of the cast. There were fans who thought the new cast was brought to replace SJH & KJK, but that doesn't make sense to fire & re-hire, only to replace, also the new members are complete opposites personality wise to SJH & KJK, that's why some fans always make conspiracy theories against certain members.",

After being apologized to, KJK convinced the whole cast to stay to continue the show, the new head PD was brought in & he added JSM & YSC with the agreement of the cast. There were fans who thought the new cast was brought to replace SJH & KJK, but that doesn't make sense to fire & re-hire, only to replace, also the new members are complete opposites personality wise to SJH & KJK, that's why some fans always make conspiracy theories against certain members.",

Same to Jong kook but he can make his own family w/out taking a break unlike jihyo who will experience pregnancy.\nDont worry guys, I'm thinking that it will be 2-3 years from now and I hope running man will still be running.",
