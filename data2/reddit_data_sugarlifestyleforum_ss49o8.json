Let me know if I'm being a jerk.\n\nWell, you're being a bit of a jerk in this case.\n\nAmongst some younger guys on SA that may very well be the case.  Although, not necessarily so, especially amongst the time-poor tech bros on the west coast or their equivalent on the east coast. \n\nHowever, the majority of SDs are rather older than this.  Those that are married generally refer to a \"dead bedroom\" situation and, for whatever reason/s, don't wish to divorce.  In this situation the SB is the modern day version of a mistress albeit without her ever thinking, necessarily, that he'll leave his wife for her - or even wanting him to.\n\nThere are also a substantial number of older, divorced SDs.  Guys like this have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and don't want a repeat.  They often find that, post-divorce, new partners want to move quite quickly and that is not what they want.\n\nFor example, I'm mid 50s, been divorced for over ten years. I pursue arrangements with younger women because I don't want the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, dog and cat, suburban home close to good schools etc.\n\nWhy not? Been there, done that.\n\nI've raised a family already and at my age I don't want to repeat that. For many young women (and not so young) the above is something they look forward to in their future and that is not something that I see myself repeating in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with women and having a meaningful relationship, however, I want to do it without leading them on with the impression that it would become something more than I'm happy to provide. So sugaring can provide meaningful relationships but without the expectation of leading to something more long term.\n\nI remember one SD who used to post here regularly once said this:-\n\n>I have used SA to look for what most would call Sugar Girlfriends. They all have just thought of me as a far better class of boyfriend. They are tired of dating what they call \"broke-ass man-children.\" They love the fact that they can go to the nicest restaurants, take epic vacations and so on.\n>\n>The value to both of us is that we can just enjoy each other without all the BS related to \"where is this relationship going....\"\n>\n>None of them have been bothered by the age difference. My current SGF just finds the looks and snide comments amusing. I recently heard one side of a conversation in which she was saying to a friend, \"He's tall, good looking, treats me better than any boyfriend I have ever had, remembers my birthday, buys me nice gifts, takes me to great places and we have great sex. You should try it, but not him (laughing).\"\n\nSo, to your point of:-\n\n>...at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI would say that you are wrong. Many guys on SD are not using SA as they \"... are not attractive enough for normal dating\" but, rather, that they are looking to \"date up\" or \"out of their league\".\n\n\nEDIT\n\n>...and that's going to end their prospects pretty quickly.\n\nAs to this point.  I've had a number of SRs last between 6 months and two years.  If you talk to some older SDs then you'll find that this is not at all unusual.\n\nDon't forget, SDs are generally not looking for \"happily ever after\", but looking to enjoy the time we spend together with our SBs.",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

Obviously there are exceptions,  small towns or localities with few men and excess women, but there's not many of those. \n\nOn the other hand, if you want to date *out of your league* then doing that without money is even harder. Women are always getting hit on by guys in their league. How do you think realistically that a guy has a chance with a woman outside his league if she's getting hit on regularly by guys who are in her league?",

Have no basis to say this, but I'm sure they are exploring it.\n\nThis makes it harder to communicate on SA -- the rate of banning is probably going to go up a notch.\n\nWhat we view as \"Experience SD's\" are probably, from SA's view, more of a mainstream expansion category for them.\n\n\\-----\n\nEDIT: At the suggestion of u/Alphachadbeard (see below,) I'm ammending to this.\n\nI am  looking at this from the perspective of how good or bad a Trademark/Name this is, if I were in SA's position.\n\nPicking a new name is complicated.

While it's origins are in social science, the word now has a lot of baggage around it.\n\nMy writing would have been clearer if I had just said:\n\n\"Dating UP\" defines their target category of women  who want men with resources as a co-priority.\n\nWhile Dating up  is a synonym for Hypergamy, it' also a synonym for what guys want -- to date out of their league.\n\nu/Alphachadbeard is right that omitting this was clumsy.\n\nAlso, though,  I'm coming to see more of the branding intelligence of Seeking, which itself was a clumsy reaction to their feeling pressed to drop the \"Arrangements\" from their name.\n\nIn this context, \"Dating Up\" better captures what's in the objective of the guy, vs \"arrangement.\"\n\nAn arrangement is what guys may have to do in *order to date up.*\n\nDating up captures the guys objective, whereas arangment is the method that achieves the objective.\n\nFrom SA's view, I give their rebranding  name is pretty good.",

Then there's the TikTok scammers, the fake profile foreign scammers, the Venezuelan/Colombian cam girl cartel, the catfishes, and the escort/Gaets crowd. Rebranding is a legal CYA/PR move and to hope for legitimacy, particularly with hopes of getting back into the app stores, since young females hate web-based messaging and scrolling. Promoting it as legitimate dating up just creates a renewed market for rinsers, gold diggers, and aspiring mail order brides, particularly now that there's such a thing as a no-divorce marriage. Just as before, it just requires an annoying and dismaying amount of work to find someone looking for the same thing, which they can't and probably aren't interested in actually stopping, since if guys can't message honestly, then they would have no reason to pay a monthly fee. SA is using new euphemisms and language and limitations, so its members will have to follow suit, the same as in the rest of public life if you don't want to get in trouble or canceled.",

Seeking doesn't filter anyone.\n\nNow, I'm absolutely not denying your point *at the moment*. It's true. :)\n\nHowever,  the discussion being about the changes on Seeking, the question is whether or not Seeking can sustain that image as real sugar daddies leave. That is, a change from a site where, yep the guys are expected to be rich AND pay allowance/ppm to one where they are portrayed as successful and NOT expected to hand over money.\n\nThat is, if the money tap is turned off, is a site just claiming to have guys rich going to be good enough? Or is it really that women on it need/want money and won't bother if the number of guys prepared to compensate them dives?\n\nNow, you may be a millionaire,  but if you are one in a thousand all claiming that, and the women wanting/needing money have gone...how will that turn out?",

            "body": "I see.  \n\nWell, I tend to find my SBs locally anyways as a way to avoid the noise of scams and escorts. For me, a SB is a young lady that I am fortunate to have as a girlfriend and I help her out with finances and she helps me out with companionship. We do things together when we can (dating) and if it weren't for the age difference, no one would have a problem with us. \n\nThe key thing making it a sugar relationship is the age difference and the mutual benefits we share. We don't have an official agreement for how many times we get together physically or even how much I pay her. \n\nI also don't tend to fish in the same pool as many other SDs. I don't quite have the financial resources of a \"traditional\" SD to provide the lifestyle of a financially affluent SD. I tend to attract single mothers or young single ladies that are having a tough time with day to day living that appreciate the little bit of help and stress relief that I can provide every month (usually around an extra thousand monthly plus extras, gifts, and I pay for our experiences and dates together).\n\nIn my experience, most of the women on Seeking are looking for more than I have to offer. And, that's the ones that are not  scammers, escorts or gold-diggers. Plus, I don't do virtual sugaring (that's ridiculous to me). Someone accused me of being a boyfriend rather than a Sugar Daddy, but I think my wife would disagree.  I don't care what the label is.\n\nOk, I know that's a lot more than what was asked, but I guess I had to unload that off my chest. I find the complaints about Seeking to be legit but, amusing.",

Let me know if I'm being a jerk.\n\nWell, you're being a bit of a jerk in this case.\n\nAmongst some younger guys on SA that may very well be the case.  Although, not necessarily so, especially amongst the time-poor tech bros on the west coast or their equivalent on the east coast. \n\nHowever, the majority of SDs are rather older than this.  Those that are married generally refer to a \"dead bedroom\" situation and, for whatever reason/s, don't wish to divorce.  In this situation the SB is the modern day version of a mistress albeit without her ever thinking, necessarily, that he'll leave his wife for her - or even wanting him to.\n\nThere are also a substantial number of older, divorced SDs.  Guys like this have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and don't want a repeat.  They often find that, post-divorce, new partners want to move quite quickly and that is not what they want.\n\nFor example, I'm mid 50s, been divorced for over ten years. I pursue arrangements with younger women because I don't want the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, dog and cat, suburban home close to good schools etc.\n\nWhy not? Been there, done that.\n\nI've raised a family already and at my age I don't want to repeat that. For many young women (and not so young) the above is something they look forward to in their future and that is not something that I see myself repeating in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with women and having a meaningful relationship, however, I want to do it without leading them on with the impression that it would become something more than I'm happy to provide. So sugaring can provide meaningful relationships but without the expectation of leading to something more long term.\n\nI remember one SD who used to post here regularly once said this:-\n\n>I have used SA to look for what most would call Sugar Girlfriends. They all have just thought of me as a far better class of boyfriend. They are tired of dating what they call \"broke-ass man-children.\" They love the fact that they can go to the nicest restaurants, take epic vacations and so on.\n>\n>The value to both of us is that we can just enjoy each other without all the BS related to \"where is this relationship going....\"\n>\n>None of them have been bothered by the age difference. My current SGF just finds the looks and snide comments amusing. I recently heard one side of a conversation in which she was saying to a friend, \"He's tall, good looking, treats me better than any boyfriend I have ever had, remembers my birthday, buys me nice gifts, takes me to great places and we have great sex. You should try it, but not him (laughing).\"\n\nSo, to your point of:-\n\n>...at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI would say that you are wrong. Many guys on SD are not using SA as they \"... are not attractive enough for normal dating\" but, rather, that they are looking to \"date up\" or \"out of their league\".\n\n\nEDIT\n\n>...and that's going to end their prospects pretty quickly.\n\nAs to this point.  I've had a number of SRs last between 6 months and two years.  If you talk to some older SDs then you'll find that this is not at all unusual.\n\nDon't forget, SDs are generally not looking for \"happily ever after\", but looking to enjoy the time we spend together with our SBs.",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

That is, a change from a site where, yep the guys are expected to be rich AND pay allowance/ppm to one where they are portrayed as successful and NOT expected to hand over money.\n\nThat is, if the money tap is turned off, is a site just claiming to have guys rich going to be good enough? Or is it really that women on it need/want money and won't bother if the number of guys prepared to compensate them dives?\n\nNow, you may be a millionaire,  but if you are one in a thousand all claiming that, and the women wanting/needing money have gone...how will that turn out?",

Let me know if I'm being a jerk.\n\nWell, you're being a bit of a jerk in this case.\n\nAmongst some younger guys on SA that may very well be the case.  Although, not necessarily so, especially amongst the time-poor tech bros on the west coast or their equivalent on the east coast. \n\nHowever, the majority of SDs are rather older than this.  Those that are married generally refer to a \"dead bedroom\" situation and, for whatever reason/s, don't wish to divorce.  In this situation the SB is the modern day version of a mistress albeit without her ever thinking, necessarily, that he'll leave his wife for her - or even wanting him to.\n\nThere are also a substantial number of older, divorced SDs.  Guys like this have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and don't want a repeat.  They often find that, post-divorce, new partners want to move quite quickly and that is not what they want.\n\nFor example, I'm mid 50s, been divorced for over ten years. I pursue arrangements with younger women because I don't want the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, dog and cat, suburban home close to good schools etc.\n\nWhy not? Been there, done that.\n\nI've raised a family already and at my age I don't want to repeat that. For many young women (and not so young) the above is something they look forward to in their future and that is not something that I see myself repeating in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with women and having a meaningful relationship, however, I want to do it without leading them on with the impression that it would become something more than I'm happy to provide. So sugaring can provide meaningful relationships but without the expectation of leading to something more long term.\n\nI remember one SD who used to post here regularly once said this:-\n\n>I have used SA to look for what most would call Sugar Girlfriends. They all have just thought of me as a far better class of boyfriend. They are tired of dating what they call \"broke-ass man-children.\" They love the fact that they can go to the nicest restaurants, take epic vacations and so on.\n>\n>The value to both of us is that we can just enjoy each other without all the BS related to \"where is this relationship going....\"\n>\n>None of them have been bothered by the age difference. My current SGF just finds the looks and snide comments amusing. I recently heard one side of a conversation in which she was saying to a friend, \"He's tall, good looking, treats me better than any boyfriend I have ever had, remembers my birthday, buys me nice gifts, takes me to great places and we have great sex. You should try it, but not him (laughing).\"\n\nSo, to your point of:-\n\n>...at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI would say that you are wrong. Many guys on SD are not using SA as they \"... are not attractive enough for normal dating\" but, rather, that they are looking to \"date up\" or \"out of their league\".\n\n\nEDIT\n\n>...and that's going to end their prospects pretty quickly.\n\nAs to this point.  I've had a number of SRs last between 6 months and two years.  If you talk to some older SDs then you'll find that this is not at all unusual.\n\nDon't forget, SDs are generally not looking for \"happily ever after\", but looking to enjoy the time we spend together with our SBs.",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

Seeking doesn't filter anyone.\n\nNow, I'm absolutely not denying your point *at the moment*. It's true. :)\n\nHowever,  the discussion being about the changes on Seeking, the question is whether or not Seeking can sustain that image as real sugar daddies leave. That is, a change from a site where, yep the guys are expected to be rich AND pay allowance/ppm to one where they are portrayed as successful and NOT expected to hand over money.\n\nThat is, if the money tap is turned off, is a site just claiming to have guys rich going to be good enough? Or is it really that women on it need/want money and won't bother if the number of guys prepared to compensate them dives?\n\nNow, you may be a millionaire,  but if you are one in a thousand all claiming that, and the women wanting/needing money have gone...how will that turn out?",

                            "body": "> ... at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI note that in your handle you say:-\n\n> Sometimes I go a little overboard. Let me know if I'm being a jerk.\n\nWell, you're being a bit of a jerk in this case.\n\nAmongst some younger guys on SA that may very well be the case.  Although, not necessarily so, especially amongst the time-poor tech bros on the west coast or their equivalent on the east coast. \n\nHowever, the majority of SDs are rather older than this.  Those that are married generally refer to a \"dead bedroom\" situation and, for whatever reason/s, don't wish to divorce.  In this situation the SB is the modern day version of a mistress albeit without her ever thinking, necessarily, that he'll leave his wife for her - or even wanting him to.\n\nThere are also a substantial number of older, divorced SDs.  Guys like this have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and don't want a repeat.  They often find that, post-divorce, new partners want to move quite quickly and that is not what they want.\n\nFor example, I'm mid 50s, been divorced for over ten years. I pursue arrangements with younger women because I don't want the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, dog and cat, suburban home close to good schools etc.\n\nWhy not? Been there, done that.\n\nI've raised a family already and at my age I don't want to repeat that. For many young women (and not so young) the above is something they look forward to in their future and that is not something that I see myself repeating in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with women and having a meaningful relationship, however, I want to do it without leading them on with the impression that it would become something more than I'm happy to provide. So sugaring can provide meaningful relationships but without the expectation of leading to something more long term.\n\nI remember one SD who used to post here regularly once said this:-\n\n>I have used SA to look for what most would call Sugar Girlfriends. They all have just thought of me as a far better class of boyfriend. They are tired of dating what they call \"broke-ass man-children.\" They love the fact that they can go to the nicest restaurants, take epic vacations and so on.\n>\n>The value to both of us is that we can just enjoy each other without all the BS related to \"where is this relationship going....\"\n>\n>None of them have been bothered by the age difference. My current SGF just finds the looks and snide comments amusing. I recently heard one side of a conversation in which she was saying to a friend, \"He's tall, good looking, treats me better than any boyfriend I have ever had, remembers my birthday, buys me nice gifts, takes me to great places and we have great sex. You should try it, but not him (laughing).\"\n\nSo, to your point of:-\n\n>...at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI would say that you are wrong. Many guys on SD are not using SA as they \"... are not attractive enough for normal dating\" but, rather, that they are looking to \"date up\" or \"out of their league\".\n\n\nEDIT\n\n>...and that's going to end their prospects pretty quickly.\n\nAs to this point.  I've had a number of SRs last between 6 months and two years.  If you talk to some older SDs then you'll find that this is not at all unusual.\n\nDon't forget, SDs are generally not looking for \"happily ever after\", but looking to enjoy the time we spend together with our SBs.",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

If you don\u2019t want to put the effort into it, it\u2019s not for you, and that\u2019s okay! I\u2019m extroverted, I love dressing up and getting attention, and working my charisma, so freestyling is more than just trying to find a SD in the wild for me. \n\nAlso, too late lol. Again, you can use vanilla dating apps, you just have to be mindful how you do it. I\u2019m not running up to men on these apps asking if they want a SB, there is a way to do it. With my technique I have yet to run into any issues or bans. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

That is, a change from a site where, yep the guys are expected to be rich AND pay allowance/ppm to one where they are portrayed as successful and NOT expected to hand over money.\n\nThat is, if the money tap is turned off, is a site just claiming to have guys rich going to be good enough? Or is it really that women on it need/want money and won't bother if the number of guys prepared to compensate them dives?\n\nNow, you may be a millionaire,  but if you are one in a thousand all claiming that, and the women wanting/needing money have gone...how will that turn out?",

                    "body": "> ... at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI note that in your handle you say:-\n\n> Sometimes I go a little overboard. Let me know if I'm being a jerk.\n\nWell, you're being a bit of a jerk in this case.\n\nAmongst some younger guys on SA that may very well be the case.  Although, not necessarily so, especially amongst the time-poor tech bros on the west coast or their equivalent on the east coast. \n\nHowever, the majority of SDs are rather older than this.  Those that are married generally refer to a \"dead bedroom\" situation and, for whatever reason/s, don't wish to divorce.  In this situation the SB is the modern day version of a mistress albeit without her ever thinking, necessarily, that he'll leave his wife for her - or even wanting him to.\n\nThere are also a substantial number of older, divorced SDs.  Guys like this have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and don't want a repeat.  They often find that, post-divorce, new partners want to move quite quickly and that is not what they want.\n\nFor example, I'm mid 50s, been divorced for over ten years. I pursue arrangements with younger women because I don't want the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, dog and cat, suburban home close to good schools etc.\n\nWhy not? Been there, done that.\n\nI've raised a family already and at my age I don't want to repeat that. For many young women (and not so young) the above is something they look forward to in their future and that is not something that I see myself repeating in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with women and having a meaningful relationship, however, I want to do it without leading them on with the impression that it would become something more than I'm happy to provide. So sugaring can provide meaningful relationships but without the expectation of leading to something more long term.\n\nI remember one SD who used to post here regularly once said this:-\n\n>I have used SA to look for what most would call Sugar Girlfriends. They all have just thought of me as a far better class of boyfriend. They are tired of dating what they call \"broke-ass man-children.\" They love the fact that they can go to the nicest restaurants, take epic vacations and so on.\n>\n>The value to both of us is that we can just enjoy each other without all the BS related to \"where is this relationship going....\"\n>\n>None of them have been bothered by the age difference. My current SGF just finds the looks and snide comments amusing. I recently heard one side of a conversation in which she was saying to a friend, \"He's tall, good looking, treats me better than any boyfriend I have ever had, remembers my birthday, buys me nice gifts, takes me to great places and we have great sex. You should try it, but not him (laughing).\"\n\nSo, to your point of:-\n\n>...at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI would say that you are wrong. Many guys on SD are not using SA as they \"... are not attractive enough for normal dating\" but, rather, that they are looking to \"date up\" or \"out of their league\".\n\n\nEDIT\n\n>...and that's going to end their prospects pretty quickly.\n\nAs to this point.  I've had a number of SRs last between 6 months and two years.  If you talk to some older SDs then you'll find that this is not at all unusual.\n\nDon't forget, SDs are generally not looking for \"happily ever after\", but looking to enjoy the time we spend together with our SBs.",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

That is, a change from a site where, yep the guys are expected to be rich AND pay allowance/ppm to one where they are portrayed as successful and NOT expected to hand over money.\n\nThat is, if the money tap is turned off, is a site just claiming to have guys rich going to be good enough? Or is it really that women on it need/want money and won't bother if the number of guys prepared to compensate them dives?\n\nNow, you may be a millionaire,  but if you are one in a thousand all claiming that, and the women wanting/needing money have gone...how will that turn out?",

            "body": "> ... at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI note that in your handle you say:-\n\n> Sometimes I go a little overboard. Let me know if I'm being a jerk.\n\nWell, you're being a bit of a jerk in this case.\n\nAmongst some younger guys on SA that may very well be the case.  Although, not necessarily so, especially amongst the time-poor tech bros on the west coast or their equivalent on the east coast. \n\nHowever, the majority of SDs are rather older than this.  Those that are married generally refer to a \"dead bedroom\" situation and, for whatever reason/s, don't wish to divorce.  In this situation the SB is the modern day version of a mistress albeit without her ever thinking, necessarily, that he'll leave his wife for her - or even wanting him to.\n\nThere are also a substantial number of older, divorced SDs.  Guys like this have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and don't want a repeat.  They often find that, post-divorce, new partners want to move quite quickly and that is not what they want.\n\nFor example, I'm mid 50s, been divorced for over ten years. I pursue arrangements with younger women because I don't want the white picket fence, 2.5 kids, dog and cat, suburban home close to good schools etc.\n\nWhy not? Been there, done that.\n\nI've raised a family already and at my age I don't want to repeat that. For many young women (and not so young) the above is something they look forward to in their future and that is not something that I see myself repeating in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with women and having a meaningful relationship, however, I want to do it without leading them on with the impression that it would become something more than I'm happy to provide. So sugaring can provide meaningful relationships but without the expectation of leading to something more long term.\n\nI remember one SD who used to post here regularly once said this:-\n\n>I have used SA to look for what most would call Sugar Girlfriends. They all have just thought of me as a far better class of boyfriend. They are tired of dating what they call \"broke-ass man-children.\" They love the fact that they can go to the nicest restaurants, take epic vacations and so on.\n>\n>The value to both of us is that we can just enjoy each other without all the BS related to \"where is this relationship going....\"\n>\n>None of them have been bothered by the age difference. My current SGF just finds the looks and snide comments amusing. I recently heard one side of a conversation in which she was saying to a friend, \"He's tall, good looking, treats me better than any boyfriend I have ever had, remembers my birthday, buys me nice gifts, takes me to great places and we have great sex. You should try it, but not him (laughing).\"\n\nSo, to your point of:-\n\n>...at the end of the day the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\n\nI would say that you are wrong. Many guys on SD are not using SA as they \"... are not attractive enough for normal dating\" but, rather, that they are looking to \"date up\" or \"out of their league\".\n\n\nEDIT\n\n>...and that's going to end their prospects pretty quickly.\n\nAs to this point.  I've had a number of SRs last between 6 months and two years.  If you talk to some older SDs then you'll find that this is not at all unusual.\n\nDon't forget, SDs are generally not looking for \"happily ever after\", but looking to enjoy the time we spend together with our SBs.",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

That is, a change from a site where, yep the guys are expected to be rich AND pay allowance/ppm to one where they are portrayed as successful and NOT expected to hand over money.\n\nThat is, if the money tap is turned off, is a site just claiming to have guys rich going to be good enough? Or is it really that women on it need/want money and won't bother if the number of guys prepared to compensate them dives?\n\nNow, you may be a millionaire,  but if you are one in a thousand all claiming that, and the women wanting/needing money have gone...how will that turn out?",

                    "body": "> I just mean to say, if you take money out of the equation completely I don\u2019t think women would stick around.\n\nNow this, I agree with.  But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",

But there's a whole world of difference between \"dating out of one's league\" or \"dating up\" due to money and, as you put it previously:-\n\n>\"...the guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"\n\nMost older SDs are either married or divorced and not looking to get into anything serious again.  Normal dating for most older SDs would be with an age appropriate, usually divorced, woman who is looking for a second (or third or fourth) husband.  This might come as a surprise, but not all older guys want that.\n\nYou are quite right that money is an essential element - just as attractiveness is, as you said, for a woman - but for an SR to be maintained for any length of time then there also has to be an element of attraction between the two people as well.  It's the combination of money and a certain level of attraction that leads to a successful, long term SR.\n\nI remember a regular contributor here, /u/willfromvb, once said:-\n\n>Many of these girls would never consider themselves as taking money for intimacy, but look at it as having a generous boyfriend or fwb.\n\nGenerosity, is certainly one aspect of being attractive.\n\nEven the US courts have weighed in on this subject in the past.  In 1991 there was a 7th Circuit Court of Appeal judgment ([United States v Harris 942 F.2d 1125 (7th Cir. 1991)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-harris-433)) where the court said that, in cases involving mistresses or SBs:-\n\n>The motivations of the parties in such cases will always be mixed. The relationship would not be long term were it not for some respect or affection. Yet, it may be equally clear that the relationship would not continue were it not for financial support or payments.\n\nThere is a lot more to sugaring than simply \"...guys are likely there because they are not attractive enough for normal dating\"",
