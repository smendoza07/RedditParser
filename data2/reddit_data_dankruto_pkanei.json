For one, he's slower than Base Naruto post SoSP power-up as Naruto was easily able to blitz the same Madara that Guy needed help from some of the fastest and most haxed people in the verse to even hit. \n\nThis same Naruto then needed several amps to even come close to keeping up with Kaguya and still had to rely on help from Sasuke and Kakashi + plus distractions to meaningfully damage her. Needless to say, this Naruto is leagues faster than even 8th gate Guy, and Sakura was completely able to watch and fully comprehend his battle with Kaguya.\n\nHell, when Kaguya was about to evade both Sasuke and Naruto at the end of their bout, Sakura did manage to move fast enough to punch Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke fully reached her position. All this with the statement from Kishimoto in the guidebook and Sakura hiden novel stating that Sakura had caught up with Naruto and Sasuke pretty much seals her victory.\n\nEven if you want to assume that is alluding to their base states, base Naruto it confirmed faster then 8th Gate Guy since Madara was completely unable to react to Naruto's blitz prior to absorbing the god tree and gaining his second rinnegan",

In my opinion the best way to do it would be to let Madara initiate the Infinite tsukyomi and have everyone be helpless to stop him, then have Guy be the only one to step up and fight him, stalling long enough for Naruto and Sasuke to step in and take over. The way I would want it to end would be with Madara slowly regenerating from the massive damage and have Guy die standing in a fighting pose as a throw back to Lee after his fight with Gaara.",

For one, he's slower than Base Naruto post SoSP power-up as Naruto was easily able to blitz the same Madara that Guy needed help from some of the fastest and most haxed people in the verse to even hit. \n\nThis same Naruto then needed several amps to even come close to keeping up with Kaguya and still had to rely on help from Sasuke and Kakashi + plus distractions to meaningfully damage her. Needless to say, this Naruto is leagues faster than even 8th gate Guy, and Sakura was completely able to watch and fully comprehend his battle with Kaguya.\n\nHell, when Kaguya was about to evade both Sasuke and Naruto at the end of their bout, Sakura did manage to move fast enough to punch Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke fully reached her position. All this with the statement from Kishimoto in the guidebook and Sakura hiden novel stating that Sakura had caught up with Naruto and Sasuke pretty much seals her victory.\n\nEven if you want to assume that is alluding to their base states, base Naruto it confirmed faster then 8th Gate Guy since Madara was completely unable to react to Naruto's blitz prior to absorbing the god tree and gaining his second rinnegan",

For one, he's slower than Base Naruto post SoSP power-up as Naruto was easily able to blitz the same Madara that Guy needed help from some of the fastest and most haxed people in the verse to even hit. \n\nThis same Naruto then needed several amps to even come close to keeping up with Kaguya and still had to rely on help from Sasuke and Kakashi + plus distractions to meaningfully damage her. Needless to say, this Naruto is leagues faster than even 8th gate Guy, and Sakura was completely able to watch and fully comprehend his battle with Kaguya.\n\nHell, when Kaguya was about to evade both Sasuke and Naruto at the end of their bout, Sakura did manage to move fast enough to punch Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke fully reached her position. All this with the statement from Kishimoto in the guidebook and Sakura hiden novel stating that Sakura had caught up with Naruto and Sasuke pretty much seals her victory.\n\nEven if you want to assume that is alluding to their base states, base Naruto it confirmed faster then 8th Gate Guy since Madara was completely unable to react to Naruto's blitz prior to absorbing the god tree and gaining his second rinnegan",

For one, he's slower than Base Naruto post SoSP power-up as Naruto was easily able to blitz the same Madara that Guy needed help from some of the fastest and most haxed people in the verse to even hit. \n\nThis same Naruto then needed several amps to even come close to keeping up with Kaguya and still had to rely on help from Sasuke and Kakashi + plus distractions to meaningfully damage her. Needless to say, this Naruto is leagues faster than even 8th gate Guy, and Sakura was completely able to watch and fully comprehend his battle with Kaguya.\n\nHell, when Kaguya was about to evade both Sasuke and Naruto at the end of their bout, Sakura did manage to move fast enough to punch Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke fully reached her position. All this with the statement from Kishimoto in the guidebook and Sakura hiden novel stating that Sakura had caught up with Naruto and Sasuke pretty much seals her victory.\n\nEven if you want to assume that is alluding to their base states, base Naruto it confirmed faster then 8th Gate Guy since Madara was completely unable to react to Naruto's blitz prior to absorbing the god tree and gaining his second rinnegan",

For one, he's slower than Base Naruto post SoSP power-up as Naruto was easily able to blitz the same Madara that Guy needed help from some of the fastest and most haxed people in the verse to even hit. \n\nThis same Naruto then needed several amps to even come close to keeping up with Kaguya and still had to rely on help from Sasuke and Kakashi + plus distractions to meaningfully damage her. Needless to say, this Naruto is leagues faster than even 8th gate Guy, and Sakura was completely able to watch and fully comprehend his battle with Kaguya.\n\nHell, when Kaguya was about to evade both Sasuke and Naruto at the end of their bout, Sakura did manage to move fast enough to punch Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke fully reached her position. All this with the statement from Kishimoto in the guidebook and Sakura hiden novel stating that Sakura had caught up with Naruto and Sasuke pretty much seals her victory.\n\nEven if you want to assume that is alluding to their base states, base Naruto it confirmed faster then 8th Gate Guy since Madara was completely unable to react to Naruto's blitz prior to absorbing the god tree and gaining his second rinnegan",

Needless to say, this Naruto is leagues faster than even 8th gate Guy, and Sakura was completely able to watch and fully comprehend his battle with Kaguya.\n\nHell, when Kaguya was about to evade both Sasuke and Naruto at the end of their bout, Sakura did manage to move fast enough to punch Kaguya back down before Naruto and Sasuke fully reached her position. All this with the statement from Kishimoto in the guidebook and Sakura hiden novel stating that Sakura had caught up with Naruto and Sasuke pretty much seals her victory.\n\nEven if you want to assume that is alluding to their base states, base Naruto it confirmed faster then 8th Gate Guy since Madara was completely unable to react to Naruto's blitz prior to absorbing the god tree and gaining his second rinnegan",
