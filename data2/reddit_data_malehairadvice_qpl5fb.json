It was slightly more pricey but I wanted to get a nice haircut so I went for it.\n\n**Products**\n\n- Shampoo: Coconut As I Am Cowash. The barber said my hair was in good condition thanks to the cowash. I wash it 2/3 times a week. My hair is curly and has low porosity so the correct product depends on the person.\n\n- Oil: She put tonic on my hair, apparently its like oil but more watery which is less heavy.\n\n- Shaving: I have a trimmer and don't have any products. Any recommendations are appreciated.\n\nWhat do you think of the update?",

Your hair was not that long.  I speak with a lot of guys in Fierce Flow that actually have long hair, over their ribs or belt long.  You just looked good the way you were.

One of my businesses still continue and I am very happy with the progress, and none of my clients care about my physical appearance.\n\nIf a company that I am applying to pays attention to my clean, curly hair, I will simply not apply and see it as a yellow/red flag. What is important is my coding skills, my 1:1 relationships with my boss and my team. If its my clean, curly hair, then they will not invite me because my linkedin picture is almost the same. Not to say I didn't have any problems going through the stages of big/small IT companies.\n\nYou are biased towards long hair, and there is nothing wrong with it. It is your opinion, I respect; but it is very different if you order me to do something. I cut it because I wanted, and my friend helped me by encouraging. \n\nMy opinion and hair might change, they might not; but if you are my boss, I will not cut it or grow it long just because you say so \ud83e\udd37",

One of my businesses still continue and I am very happy with the progress, and none of my clients care about my physical appearance.\n\nIf a company that I am applying to pays attention to my clean, curly hair, I will simply not apply and see it as a yellow/red flag. What is important is my coding skills, my 1:1 relationships with my boss and my team. If its my clean, curly hair, then they will not invite me because my linkedin picture is almost the same. Not to say I didn't have any problems going through the stages of big/small IT companies.\n\nYou are biased towards long hair, and there is nothing wrong with it. It is your opinion, I respect; but it is very different if you order me to do something. I cut it because I wanted, and my friend helped me by encouraging. \n\nMy opinion and hair might change, they might not; but if you are my boss, I will not cut it or grow it long just because you say so \ud83e\udd37",
