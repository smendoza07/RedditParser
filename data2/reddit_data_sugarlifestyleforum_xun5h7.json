    "body": "Meet a young lady on Seeking. She is a 20yo student, good looking and thin. After some dialogue, she asks for what a ppm would be. I let her go first and she quotes a high ppm in text, I reply with a nice pass message and move on. A few days later, she comes back with another offer. I pass again. She comes back a few days later asking what would work. I hate doing this upfront as I prefer in or after a call or M&G. I give her my standard not knowing if there will be any chemistry. She agrees, which was 50% of her initial. Ok, a little weird, but maybe she is new. We have a video call, goes well. She requests another video call, and that goes fine. She offers her IG account and there are a few photos there posted over a few months, but clearly not her personal account and this was created just for sugaring, which was a little of a red flag.  I then schedule a M&G close to us both, each are able to walk there. A few hours before she says if the meet goes well can we start the arrangement. I say sure, not too unusual. About ten minutes before I leave she asks me to bring the money in an envelope because she doesn't like the transactional side, and will ask for it upfront. This level of awareness and her apparent nervousness during some of our interaction starts to raise my antenna. I do a mental accounting of our interaction (like when someone three bets you all in after the river and you are so surprised you have to review their actions over the entire hand one more time). I decide to cancel and text her that I am out, she says please meet she is just being umtra cautious. I say OK as I am curious where this goes and pretty sure it isn't on the level. I prepare two envelopes, one with one dollar bills and one with hundreds. Same number of bills in each, one has the PPM and the other one has 1/100 of the PPM. Seal each one and take them with me.\n\nWe meet at an Italian place and she is underage and it is early evening. She didn't want anything to eat and we have some virgin cocktails. Have a good chat. She asks if we can start the arrangement. I say OK. She asks for the ppm before we go anywhere else. In a normal situation, I wouldn't have given it to her and told her to wait for the hotel. If she had demanded now, I would have said no. However, I am crazy curious what she is going to do, and give her the envelope with singles. Weirdly, she holds it up to the light to verify it's content and doesn't open the seal, and then satisfied says thanks. She said she needs another napkin and goes across the room to the bar. Without missing a beat she walks across the room and straight out the front door. I was smiling like the Cheshire cat. She never looked back, not once. I was ready to follow and gave her a minute head start and followed her. I had to see her open the envelope. Literally she never once looked back to see if I followed. I followed at about 200 yards. About a block away she stopped by a bus stop and opened the envelope, which was the only thing she was carrying. She slammed her hand on her leg and immediately called someone on her phone.\n\nIt was the first brazen attempt that I have seen in a long time. My gut worked well, but work was a little slower than normal so had to see this one through. Stay safe.....",

All along her English was bad in subtle ways and I asked her about her English and she said it was very good so I didn\u2019t correct her. Then we plan a date when she\u2019s back. She says the 5th and I\u2019m like we said Friday I\u2019m confused. Then she trier to sell me stable coins and I could make 1% per day!! I told her that wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. Never heard from\nHer again. That was also a good effort!",

I don't need alcohol to have fun and I definitely don't try to shove it down anyone's throat so they like me or want to f*** me more.\n\nIn terms of determining maturity, it definitely is a factor, but one of my best SRs was with a 19yo. She was crazy smart, crazy mature, crazy enjoyed intimate time and just fun to be around. We didn't drink at all when we went out. If a SB can't drink, I won't either.

I don't need alcohol to have fun and I definitely don't try to shove it down anyone's throat so they like me or want to f*** me more.\n\nIn terms of determining maturity, it definitely is a factor, but one of my best SRs was with a 19yo. She was crazy smart, crazy mature, crazy enjoyed intimate time and just fun to be around. We didn't drink at all when we went out. If a SB can't drink, I won't either. The odds are higher as you get younger that they lack maturity, but YMMV and that is what a M&G is for after all.",

You only need about 15 seconds to leave any place calmly.\n3) if someone stopped you or you can't get out and commotion was high. Calmly, calmly, calmly apologize that your niece/nanny/friend hasn't taken her medication and you are dialing 911. Feign dialing 911 and look for a good chance in the first 30 sec to leave quietly.\n\nIn a big city people will look at her like she is just another crazy person, this happens with some frequency with mentally disturbed people anyway.
