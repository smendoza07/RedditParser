    "body": "**Preface**: no I\u2019m not stating that sugaring is a legitimate job or should ever qualify as actual employment - before anyone tries to claim that in the comments. \n\nI wanted to comment on a common trope I\u2019ve been recently seeing a lot of on this sub, that goes to the tune of \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t feel like work\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t compare this to work, it\u2019s a relationship\u201d. And on the surface- I 100% agree. The last thing I\u2019d want, is to feel like I\u2019m \u201cworking\u201d or that sugaring is emotionally draining. Frankly I only engage in SRs that feel enjoyable and don't seem like a chore through meticulous vetting and being incredibly picky. However, not all, but some SDs who I\u2019ve seen preach this idea, also seem to have a very low threshold of what **they** would tolerate from a SB. We have all seen the comments on posts telling other SDs \u201c*dump her!*\u201d or \u201c*sounds like you\u2019ll have to put in a lot of work with that SB, red flag*\u201d. Due to the over-saturation and availability of SBs, they become somewhat \u201cdispensable\u201d to a degree. This rhetoric of \u201c*you shouldn\u2019t look at our relationship as a job, however I will let you go when you aren\u2019t meeting my expectations of service*\u201d seems to almost contradict their request for a \u201cgenuine connection\u201d. And yes I used the word \u201cservice\u201d intentionally. Do not lie to yourself that the sugar you are providing is to get the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of a SB. Your sugar is meant for the good sides only, and if the slightest hint of a bad trait shows up- They are replaced, reinforcing that you have an expectation of conduct and a SB needs to act accordingly...almost like job. \n\n\u201c*But SomethingSweet, this is a two-way street. My sb can just as easily leave me too if she's not satisfied*\u201d, that is correct. But the message that SBs are conveyed is that \u201c*he\u2019s giving you sugar so you* ***should*** *tolerate more than what you might in other circumstances (ex. vanilla relationship)*\u201d. That is the exact opposite of the messages SDs get. SDs are told, *\u201cif she isn\u2019t living up to your expectation of what you believe your money can get you; start searching for another SB*\u201d. This threat of being replaced only magnifies a SB to feel a pressure to continue to provide this \u201cperfect experience\u201d. It seems almost obvious that someone would feel that the effort they are putting into being *their best self* at all times for their SD, can almost start to feel like work. This isn\u2019t to say that this dynamic should be *different* or changed, it works and is necessary in this subset of relationships to continue.  However the dialogue of \u201c*stop comparing this perfect experience you are giving me to anything remotely like a job*\u201d seems a little absurd for SDs to get riled up about. It\u2019s comical when I hear the same SDs who complain about wanting this \u201creal connection\u201d that includes unlimited passion, mind blowing intimacy, enlightening conversations; are also the ones who can\u2019t fathom why an SB would feel like meeting this standard can feel like a job....especially a job they can lose with all the competition, I mean - more \u201creal\u201d connections, readily available. \n\n**Clarification**\\- this rant is more directed to the specific SDs who get offended when an SB acknowledges or even would appreciate recognition for the amount of effort (and at times, work) they are putting into the SR to keep it as drama-free and as fun as possible. SDs who generously support their SBs and treat them like gold even when they\u2019re imperfect- we see you, we love you, and you are appreciated \ud83d\udc95",

When I'm going to see an SB I make sure to look my best, be clean, well dressed, and wear nice cologne. If she's coming over I'll make an extra effort to get the house tidy and clean. I'll put time and thought into finding a nice place for us to eat or getting the right bottle of wine. I'll go out of my way to be responsive to texts and calls and keep any commitment I make. I put a lot of effort into gifts that show my genuine interest in her as a person. I treat any woman I'm dating, vanilla or sugar, with more care and empathy than I'd treat almost anyone else in my life. Again that's dating. To me an SR should be similar to a vanilla relationship in that both partners should put their best foot forward for the other person, at least at first. As you get comfortable with each other some of that facade begins to slip and that's when you figure out if there is really a deep connection or if you were into the idealized version of the person they presented on the first few dates. But that effort doesn't make it a job even if there is a financial support component. \n\nUsually by putting your best foot forward yourself and making it clear you are not asking for perfection, you can find a connection if there is any chemistry. If a POT can't get over feeling the need to live up to unattainable standards and still views this as a job we just aren't a good fit. No hard feelings.",

As a result, your profile on SA is treated like a job application: the SD filters and ranks based on profile details, and the SBs are on a waiting list or in a vetting process. If the SB fails the vetting process, they join the waiting list again for multiple SDs. According to Brandon Wade, the seeking/waiting process can take a year before finding something real and meaningful.\n\nI have 11 months to go I guess.\n\nI encourage SBs \u2014who feel like they\u2019re jaded by the sugar experience, to keep improving yourself for your own self-esteem and work your buns off at any creative project/job that you can do. Let SA and sugaring be a hobby if you wish to eventually find the person without feeling the need to be pretentious/treat sugaring as a job you need.",

It\u2019s more when the SDs don\u2019t acknowledge that it happens and get mad when because for them it feels effortless (based on your above mentioned reasons) they assume it\u2019s easy on an SB- which sometimes it\u2019s not as simple. I personally love the SDs I have met and have had SRs with. They treat me with so much respect and they don\u2019t make me feel like I have to be at my best all the time. I think this forum at times can show that negative side of things, especially in posts where individuals ask for advice and the first response is \u201cred flag\u201d to someone getting into one disagreement with their partner. And for that, it almost gets taught that you should value meeting the needs of whom your with first or else you\u2019ll be let go. While that isn\u2019t always the case and plenty of people do put a value on the actual connection many do have the mindset of \u201cthis is temporary until I\u2019m bored of you...but I expect you to have genuine attraction and feelings for me or else you are just transactional\u201d, which we all know isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s just the echoed messages I see, so i wanted to rant about it for a bit lol",

I expect anyone that I am dating to put effort into treating me well, even in vanilla.   In my SR, I am putting a lot of effort into making my SB happy, not just with the sugar, but with my actions and words.    I absolutely understand she will have some bad days and don't expect her to be \"on her A game\" every date, but it seems pretty fair and reasonable that she should put in a good deal of effort to be a good partner to me.   Again, I'd expect this from a vanilla partner, so I certainly expect it when there's sugar involved as well.",

There sometimes feels like this innate pressure to be perfect because of how much other \u201coptions\u201d there are. I personally haven\u2019t been with an SD that hasn\u2019t accepted, all aspects of me- but just some of the posts on this sub scream that message. I\u2019m sure you could scroll through this sub over the past week and see thousands of comments from others suggesting to leave her or that there\u2019s \u201ctoo much drama\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s getting sugar so she should be ok with your additional requests\u201d. Things of that nature. And while I don\u2019t disagree that these things can be mutual to an extent and therefore can be somewhat expected, the more expectations that are required of anyone the less it becomes organic and therefore can almost feel like \u201cwork\u201d. I\u2019m not here preaching that an SB should be rocking sweats every day when they see their man, but also I don\u2019t think SBs get as many \u201cchances\u201d for when they don\u2019t live up to SDs preset expectations, whereas an SB seems to \u201ctolerate or look past\u201d certain actions/traits/expectations their SD shows and it\u2019s normalized to do that",

I\u2019ll just discuss a few. \n\nIf there is an SD that is giving and allowing in the top 1%, that SB will def have to work to provide the best service. The problem is with everyone else. They want what the 1% has without the premium cost. If a SD is giving the standard allowance, they should not expect as much but they do.\n\nRich mentality. Once you get \u201csuccessful\u201d, the way you think starts to change. A lot of it becomes about what\u2019s worth your time and it bleeds into everything else. Let\u2019s say I make roughly 200 an hour. I bought something online for 20 but it ended up not being the correct item. Do I spend 1+ hour filling out a return, boxing it back up, stopping by UPS or do I just throw it away in the trash and buy the correct item. Now, I\u2019m not saying a SB is the same as an item. But the way the rich think is something to consider. \n\nThat being said, there are many SDs that still have their head on straight and those are the ones you\u2019re looking for; the same for SBs. Hopefully they can weed through the bad and find each other.",

Do it anyway, or you are whiny and dont love him. (Heaven forbid YOU ask him to try and he will act like you nearly killed him with a  pinky finger.)\n\n\\- Working at a job and the boss harresses you? He is so nice he wouldnt DARE do that be quiet! (You report it anyway and he is MOVED STORES NOT FIRED)\n\n\\- Your family wants to come over despite you needing space? Why dont you love them? Your a bitch! (Do this to them however and you are a bitch for not giving space enough)\n\nYou have to set boundaries that are not taught to you ever.  So for the rest of your life you have to work on a power imbalance in everything you do, and get used to being called names and more for demanding what you are worth in time, money and space. If you are are lucky and learn them you get to develop thick skin early but STILL have to fight to be heard and boundaries respected.\n\nbeing uncomfortable is a state alot of woman remain in on a daily basis.",

They have been ok with me coming over some days without my hair perfectly done or without wearing a tight dress and heels. Those SDs are the ones who totally rock and anyone would want to go above and beyond to appreciate them fully. \n\nIn terms of dating - you\u2019re 100% right, there is no guarantee anything will last.

I love SRs. They exist for a purpose and its to give people a taste of this fantasy world that no one would be able to maintain if not for the sugar on both ends. The moral of my rant, albeit long winded and confusing, is less about whether connections can form and more so to critique the people who think that being this \u201cperfect Sb\u201d in a \u201cperfect SR\u201d comes without diligent effort and work to make it come off so effortless.",

My SBs definitely know that I'm not the norm but they haven't been able to shift their mindset and continue to want to provide the best (positive) experience even when I ask them to not do so.  Perhaps if we have more ways to classify an SR, we could get people to align upfront rather than find out that we're not aligned even when using the same terminology?  :/",

It\u2019s more when the SDs don\u2019t acknowledge that it happens and get mad when because for them it feels effortless (based on your above mentioned reasons) they assume it\u2019s easy on an SB- which sometimes it\u2019s not as simple. I personally love the SDs I have met and have had SRs with. They treat me with so much respect and they don\u2019t make me feel like I have to be at my best all the time. I think this forum at times can show that negative side of things, especially in posts where individuals ask for advice and the first response is \u201cred flag\u201d to someone getting into one disagreement with their partner. And for that, it almost gets taught that you should value meeting the needs of whom your with first or else you\u2019ll be let go. While that isn\u2019t always the case and plenty of people do put a value on the actual connection many do have the mindset of \u201cthis is temporary until I\u2019m bored of you...but I expect you to have genuine attraction and feelings for me or else you are just transactional\u201d, which we all know isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s just the echoed messages I see, so i wanted to rant about it for a bit lol",

There sometimes feels like this innate pressure to be perfect because of how much other \u201coptions\u201d there are. I personally haven\u2019t been with an SD that hasn\u2019t accepted, all aspects of me- but just some of the posts on this sub scream that message. I\u2019m sure you could scroll through this sub over the past week and see thousands of comments from others suggesting to leave her or that there\u2019s \u201ctoo much drama\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s getting sugar so she should be ok with your additional requests\u201d. Things of that nature. And while I don\u2019t disagree that these things can be mutual to an extent and therefore can be somewhat expected, the more expectations that are required of anyone the less it becomes organic and therefore can almost feel like \u201cwork\u201d. I\u2019m not here preaching that an SB should be rocking sweats every day when they see their man, but also I don\u2019t think SBs get as many \u201cchances\u201d for when they don\u2019t live up to SDs preset expectations, whereas an SB seems to \u201ctolerate or look past\u201d certain actions/traits/expectations their SD shows and it\u2019s normalized to do that",

Do it anyway, or you are whiny and dont love him. (Heaven forbid YOU ask him to try and he will act like you nearly killed him with a  pinky finger.)\n\n\\- Working at a job and the boss harresses you? He is so nice he wouldnt DARE do that be quiet! (You report it anyway and he is MOVED STORES NOT FIRED)\n\n\\- Your family wants to come over despite you needing space? Why dont you love them? Your a bitch! (Do this to them however and you are a bitch for not giving space enough)\n\nYou have to set boundaries that are not taught to you ever.  So for the rest of your life you have to work on a power imbalance in everything you do, and get used to being called names and more for demanding what you are worth in time, money and space. If you are are lucky and learn them you get to develop thick skin early but STILL have to fight to be heard and boundaries respected.\n\nbeing uncomfortable is a state alot of woman remain in on a daily basis.",

My SBs definitely know that I'm not the norm but they haven't been able to shift their mindset and continue to want to provide the best (positive) experience even when I ask them to not do so.  Perhaps if we have more ways to classify an SR, we could get people to align upfront rather than find out that we're not aligned even when using the same terminology?  :/",

There\u2019s sooooo many sbs and while all of us don\u2019t want to think we will get dumped- it\u2019s always a possibility.

If everyone else that they seek advice for SRs with is telling them \u201cdon\u2019t mess up\u201d or they see other SDs saying that by not always being in a good mood can come off as \u201cdramatic\u201d - it\u2019s no shock why they worry to show those sides. There\u2019s sooooo many sbs and while all of us don\u2019t want to think we will get dumped- it\u2019s always a possibility. I think the last thing we want to do is be a contribution for a premature ending to an SR especially if we can avoid it by putting our best foot forward. I agree though- it\u2019s so much easier to just be authentic and I\u2019m thankful I\u2019ve met SDs who are gracious for me being myself",
