When did Nagato say they cost a shit ton of chakra and are not worth it? His animal path was spamming summoning and he didn't seem to sweat it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Let's: use a small portion of your chakra to push a child away (which doesn't do damage according to you) or push chakra rods away, or jump in front of the kid and get stabbed instead? Considering Isshiki wouldn't have been able to shrink a wave of gravity, it would have been a valuable tool to keep him pinned as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A big version of it created the moon and kept Kaguya imprisoned for thousands of years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. How about using it to create a mechanical arm to fight with, or use the missiles to keep creating debris in the ground and air (so him and Naruto can disguise a clone and get a drop on him). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Yeah soul grabbing people is so weak that it's weakness is so massive that you couldn't think of one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. When did Sasuke use it in Boruto? He had it in Shippuden, but didn't use it in Boruto. He could have used it to replenish his empty chakra pool to actually fight instead of whining that he is out of chakra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. First that is your head canon. Kabuto stated that he could use it to repair Naruto's body if he badly hurt him in the fight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sasuke never used the rods, which is something all rinnegan users have, so yep. It's not that the outer is useless, it is that the tool it needs to work was never used by Sasuke. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Again showing you don't know what you're talking about. The GM is still there, rewatch the ending of Kaguya. She becomes the GM again after she is sealed. Sasuke doesn't need that though since he had many tools in his arsenal but never used them, so summoning the GM serves no purpose since at best he would use it to jump higher and be out of chakra for the rest of the event.",

You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit. We know that Paths of Pain can utilize their original abilities if the controller so desires because Obito did that with six dead Jinchuriki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinra Tensei and Bansho Tenin are also inherently useful.

He then proceeded to ignore 80% of my counter-evidence and tried to guilt-trip me for harming his ego. This guy despite claiming to be \"too busy taking care of his siblings to argue back\" then proceeds to repeat the same insipid arguments on different threads like a video recorder.

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

I assume Madara managed to do that due to the mastery he had over it. It's possible that the susano is likely more tied to the Uchiha blood than the eyes themselves? So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

Kishimoto has slowly been trying to nerf the Rinnegan after Pain by giving it different abilities and not let other Rinnegan users use Pain's full kit. So Obito just uses the chains, Madara only uses chakra absorption, chains and meteor summoning and Sasuke uses teleporation, Bansho Tenin and Teleportation. Rinnegan is too OP and it's better to get rid of it now because the plot won't let Sasuke use its full potential or he could legitimately take down anyone",

Kishimoto made Naruto and Sasuke way too OP by the end of the War Arc. But I think he never really was thinking about writing them both again since Boruto wasnt decided at that time so making them this powerful wouldnt have been as much of a problem if the Naruto series ended for good after Shippuden as it should had.",

Honestly I didn\u2019t care that much for Boruto and the other kids. Would have been more interested if it flashed forward to the time when they are parents and the grand kids of Naruto and the rest of his generation are the ones who have to step up while learning the ropes as shinobi and assist their parents as new powerful threats emerge to shatter the peace that they enjoyed for decades. That way they Naruto and Sasuke could be legendary figures of the past that their descendants have to work hard to live up to. At least that way we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the writers coming up with bullshit ways of nerfing them for reasons of plot convenience",

When did Nagato say they cost a shit ton of chakra and are not worth it? His animal path was spamming summoning and he didn't seem to sweat it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Let's: use a small portion of your chakra to push a child away (which doesn't do damage according to you) or push chakra rods away, or jump in front of the kid and get stabbed instead? Considering Isshiki wouldn't have been able to shrink a wave of gravity, it would have been a valuable tool to keep him pinned as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A big version of it created the moon and kept Kaguya imprisoned for thousands of years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. How about using it to create a mechanical arm to fight with, or use the missiles to keep creating debris in the ground and air (so him and Naruto can disguise a clone and get a drop on him). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Yeah soul grabbing people is so weak that it's weakness is so massive that you couldn't think of one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. When did Sasuke use it in Boruto? He had it in Shippuden, but didn't use it in Boruto. He could have used it to replenish his empty chakra pool to actually fight instead of whining that he is out of chakra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. First that is your head canon. Kabuto stated that he could use it to repair Naruto's body if he badly hurt him in the fight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sasuke never used the rods, which is something all rinnegan users have, so yep. It's not that the outer is useless, it is that the tool it needs to work was never used by Sasuke. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Again showing you don't know what you're talking about. The GM is still there, rewatch the ending of Kaguya. She becomes the GM again after she is sealed. Sasuke doesn't need that though since he had many tools in his arsenal but never used them, so summoning the GM serves no purpose since at best he would use it to jump higher and be out of chakra for the rest of the event.",

For example, if you repaired the eyes of Itachi's corpse and then used the body as a Path of Pain, exploiting the Rinnegan-awakening-negates-Izanagi-Izanami-blindness mechanic to restore the blind left eye, then that's fucking OP as fuck. You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit. We know that Paths of Pain can utilize their original abilities if the controller so desires because Obito did that with six dead Jinchuriki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinra Tensei and Bansho Tenin are also inherently useful. If those abilities can scale with the power you have, having an easy means of gravity manipulation can allow you to repel attacks and pull people into your own attacks. We see Sasuke in the anime using Bansho Tenin to pull Naruto and his Shadow Clones directly into Sasuke's Enton: Honoikazuchi.",

That's like saying a healthy adult male at their physical prime would stalemate their 16-year-old self in a fistfight to the death. Those people are absolutely ridiculous and will use any mental gymnastics to grasp on straws defending the illogical writing of Boruto such that they forget basic human physiology.

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

It's possible that the susano is likely more tied to the Uchiha blood than the eyes themselves? So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

Kishimoto has slowly been trying to nerf the Rinnegan after Pain by giving it different abilities and not let other Rinnegan users use Pain's full kit. So Obito just uses the chains, Madara only uses chakra absorption, chains and meteor summoning and Sasuke uses teleporation, Bansho Tenin and Teleportation. Rinnegan is too OP and it's better to get rid of it now because the plot won't let Sasuke use its full potential or he could legitimately take down anyone",

Honestly I didn\u2019t care that much for Boruto and the other kids. Would have been more interested if it flashed forward to the time when they are parents and the grand kids of Naruto and the rest of his generation are the ones who have to step up while learning the ropes as shinobi and assist their parents as new powerful threats emerge to shatter the peace that they enjoyed for decades. That way they Naruto and Sasuke could be legendary figures of the past that their descendants have to work hard to live up to. At least that way we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the writers coming up with bullshit ways of nerfing them for reasons of plot convenience",

Add that they share vision with the user, so a summoner can strategically place them around the field and they would have constant surveillance on the enemy. When did Nagato say they cost a shit ton of chakra and are not worth it? His animal path was spamming summoning and he didn't seem to sweat it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Let's: use a small portion of your chakra to push a child away (which doesn't do damage according to you) or push chakra rods away, or jump in front of the kid and get stabbed instead? Considering Isshiki wouldn't have been able to shrink a wave of gravity, it would have been a valuable tool to keep him pinned as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A big version of it created the moon and kept Kaguya imprisoned for thousands of years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. How about using it to create a mechanical arm to fight with, or use the missiles to keep creating debris in the ground and air (so him and Naruto can disguise a clone and get a drop on him). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Yeah soul grabbing people is so weak that it's weakness is so massive that you couldn't think of one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. When did Sasuke use it in Boruto? He had it in Shippuden, but didn't use it in Boruto. He could have used it to replenish his empty chakra pool to actually fight instead of whining that he is out of chakra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. First that is your head canon. Kabuto stated that he could use it to repair Naruto's body if he badly hurt him in the fight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sasuke never used the rods, which is something all rinnegan users have, so yep. It's not that the outer is useless, it is that the tool it needs to work was never used by Sasuke. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Again showing you don't know what you're talking about. The GM is still there, rewatch the ending of Kaguya. She becomes the GM again after she is sealed. Sasuke doesn't need that though since he had many tools in his arsenal but never used them, so summoning the GM serves no purpose since at best he would use it to jump higher and be out of chakra for the rest of the event.",

For example, if you repaired the eyes of Itachi's corpse and then used the body as a Path of Pain, exploiting the Rinnegan-awakening-negates-Izanagi-Izanami-blindness mechanic to restore the blind left eye, then that's fucking OP as fuck. You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit. We know that Paths of Pain can utilize their original abilities if the controller so desires because Obito did that with six dead Jinchuriki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinra Tensei and Bansho Tenin are also inherently useful. If those abilities can scale with the power you have, having an easy means of gravity manipulation can allow you to repel attacks and pull people into your own attacks.

That's like saying a healthy adult male at their physical prime would stalemate their 16-year-old self in a fistfight to the death. Those people are absolutely ridiculous and will use any mental gymnastics to grasp on straws defending the illogical writing of Boruto such that they forget basic human physiology. They completely ignore that people become *nonlinearly* stronger when they reach adulthood.",

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

It's possible that the susano is likely more tied to the Uchiha blood than the eyes themselves? So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

Kishimoto has slowly been trying to nerf the Rinnegan after Pain by giving it different abilities and not let other Rinnegan users use Pain's full kit. So Obito just uses the chains, Madara only uses chakra absorption, chains and meteor summoning and Sasuke uses teleporation, Bansho Tenin and Teleportation. Rinnegan is too OP and it's better to get rid of it now because the plot won't let Sasuke use its full potential or he could legitimately take down anyone",

Kishimoto made Naruto and Sasuke way too OP by the end of the War Arc.

Let's: use a small portion of your chakra to push a child away (which doesn't do damage according to you) or push chakra rods away, or jump in front of the kid and get stabbed instead? Considering Isshiki wouldn't have been able to shrink a wave of gravity, it would have been a valuable tool to keep him pinned as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A big version of it created the moon and kept Kaguya imprisoned for thousands of years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

Yeah soul grabbing people is so weak that it's weakness is so massive that you couldn't think of one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. When did Sasuke use it in Boruto? He had it in Shippuden, but didn't use it in Boruto. He could have used it to replenish his empty chakra pool to actually fight instead of whining that he is out of chakra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. First that is your head canon. Kabuto stated that he could use it to repair Naruto's body if he badly hurt him in the fight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sasuke never used the rods, which is something all rinnegan users have, so yep. It's not that the outer is useless, it is that the tool it needs to work was never used by Sasuke. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Again showing you don't know what you're talking about. The GM is still there, rewatch the ending of Kaguya. She becomes the GM again after she is sealed. Sasuke doesn't need that though since he had many tools in his arsenal but never used them, so summoning the GM serves no purpose since at best he would use it to jump higher and be out of chakra for the rest of the event.",

For example, if you repaired the eyes of Itachi's corpse and then used the body as a Path of Pain, exploiting the Rinnegan-awakening-negates-Izanagi-Izanami-blindness mechanic to restore the blind left eye, then that's fucking OP as fuck. You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit. We know that Paths of Pain can utilize their original abilities if the controller so desires because Obito did that with six dead Jinchuriki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinra Tensei and Bansho Tenin are also inherently useful. If those abilities can scale with the power you have, having an easy means of gravity manipulation can allow you to repel attacks and pull people into your own attacks. We see Sasuke in the anime using Bansho Tenin to pull Naruto and his Shadow Clones directly into Sasuke's Enton: Honoikazuchi.",

The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

It's possible that the susano is likely more tied to the Uchiha blood than the eyes themselves? So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

Kishimoto has slowly been trying to nerf the Rinnegan after Pain by giving it different abilities and not let other Rinnegan users use Pain's full kit. So Obito just uses the chains, Madara only uses chakra absorption, chains and meteor summoning and Sasuke uses teleporation, Bansho Tenin and Teleportation. Rinnegan is too OP and it's better to get rid of it now because the plot won't let Sasuke use its full potential or he could legitimately take down anyone",

Kishimoto made Naruto and Sasuke way too OP by the end of the War Arc. But I think he never really was thinking about writing them both again since Boruto wasnt decided at that time so making them this powerful wouldnt have been as much of a problem if the Naruto series ended for good after Shippuden as it should had.",

When did Nagato say they cost a shit ton of chakra and are not worth it? His animal path was spamming summoning and he didn't seem to sweat it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Let's: use a small portion of your chakra to push a child away (which doesn't do damage according to you) or push chakra rods away, or jump in front of the kid and get stabbed instead? Considering Isshiki wouldn't have been able to shrink a wave of gravity, it would have been a valuable tool to keep him pinned as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A big version of it created the moon and kept Kaguya imprisoned for thousands of years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. How about using it to create a mechanical arm to fight with, or use the missiles to keep creating debris in the ground and air (so him and Naruto can disguise a clone and get a drop on him). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Yeah soul grabbing people is so weak that it's weakness is so massive that you couldn't think of one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. When did Sasuke use it in Boruto? He had it in Shippuden, but didn't use it in Boruto. He could have used it to replenish his empty chakra pool to actually fight instead of whining that he is out of chakra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. First that is your head canon. Kabuto stated that he could use it to repair Naruto's body if he badly hurt him in the fight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sasuke never used the rods, which is something all rinnegan users have, so yep. It's not that the outer is useless, it is that the tool it needs to work was never used by Sasuke. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Again showing you don't know what you're talking about. The GM is still there, rewatch the ending of Kaguya. She becomes the GM again after she is sealed. Sasuke doesn't need that though since he had many tools in his arsenal but never used them, so summoning the GM serves no purpose since at best he would use it to jump higher and be out of chakra for the rest of the event.",

You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit.

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

It's possible that the susano is likely more tied to the Uchiha blood than the eyes themselves? So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit.

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

For example, if you repaired the eyes of Itachi's corpse and then used the body as a Path of Pain, exploiting the Rinnegan-awakening-negates-Izanagi-Izanami-blindness mechanic to restore the blind left eye, then that's fucking OP as fuck. You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit. We know that Paths of Pain can utilize their original abilities if the controller so desires because Obito did that with six dead Jinchuriki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinra Tensei and Bansho Tenin are also inherently useful. If those abilities can scale with the power you have, having an easy means of gravity manipulation can allow you to repel attacks and pull people into your own attacks. We see Sasuke in the anime using Bansho Tenin to pull Naruto and his Shadow Clones directly into Sasuke's Enton: Honoikazuchi.",

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

So i imagine that you get the eyes, you unlock the ability, but after you master it enough you don't really need the sharingan to use it. Now that i think about it....didn't Amaterasu's flames come out of the eyes? And you have to look at them for tsukuyoni as well. Susanoo is the only ability that doesn't really come from eyesight but as a side effect of the Mangekyou.\nEdit: actually Kakashi managed to summon a susanoo so i guess it could be both actually. Highly unlikely that Kakashi could pull a susanoo without the sharingans, so the only explanation i have would be the blood.",

You now have access to Totsuka Blade Yata Mirror Susanoo, extended field of vision, possibly even Tsukuyomi and Izanami and all that op shit. We know that Paths of Pain can utilize their original abilities if the controller so desires because Obito did that with six dead Jinchuriki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinra Tensei and Bansho Tenin are also inherently useful. If those abilities can scale with the power you have, having an easy means of gravity manipulation can allow you to repel attacks and pull people into your own attacks.

That's like saying a healthy adult male at their physical prime would stalemate their 16-year-old self in a fistfight to the death. Those people are absolutely ridiculous and will use any mental gymnastics to grasp on straws defending the illogical writing of Boruto such that they forget basic human physiology. They completely ignore that people become *nonlinearly* stronger when they reach adulthood.",

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",

For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals.

            "body": "Would you agree that if Kodachi were writing Naruto and Sasuke with good faith, they could have easily used these tools in their arsenal regularly:\n\n**Naruto**\n\nBoil Release: Unrivalled Strength - OP as fuck Taijutsu amp that's second only to the last-ditch Baryon Mode, but also has ZERO negative aftereffects whatsoever so Naruto could spam it all the time and win all of his non-Otsutsuki fights in seconds. It's equivalent to opening the Gate of Death all the time without dying. OP as fuck.\n\nBR:US-amped Shadow Clone Army - \"Would you like these thousands of Shadow Clones to use Boil Release or not?\"\n\nShadow Clone trickery and misdirection tactics - This is Naruto's modus operandi. The fact that he doesn't use this to the fullest is saddening.\n\nSix Paths Frog Kata - This would be fucking busted against any non-Otsutsuki. Combine it with BR:US and he'd be unstoppable. He could one-punch-kill anyone without even physically touching them.\n\nFlight - Why the fuck does Naruto run on the ground all the time if it's canonically-confirmed that he can fucking fly? For example, if Isshiki summons rods from the ground then couldn't Naruto just fucking *FLY AWAY FROM THEM?*\n\n**Sasuke**\n\nIntelligent Amenotejikara - Kodachi portrayed Ameno like it was a child's toy, but Ameno is really fucking OP if you think about it. If there are simple arbitrary objects around your enemy, you could easily switch places with said objects and speedblitz your enemy to death in an instant. It's like Flying Raijin but with no marks needed. Also, given the fact that Sasuke got this as a teenager and had nearly two decades to perfect this ability, he would have easily trained himself to reduce its chakra cost and be able to use air molecules as teleportation points, effectively granting him unlimited mobility.\n\nKirin - This is easily Sasuke's most powerful non-SP lightning jutsu. He could easily optimize this to operate like a Chidori but with natural lightning. This would have been super useful against Otsutsukis because they can't absorb natural lightning.\n\nMadara as a Path of Pain + Four Limbo Clones - The higher-ups at the ninja world knew that there were other Otsutsukis after the Toneri event. If Sasuke were actually smart with this information, he would have immediately went to the Sage of Six Paths and obtained the corpse of Madara Uchiha to use as a Path of Pain retaining his original abilities and accessing the OP-as-fuck Limbo Hengoku. Add that with the possibility that Limbo Clones can use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, and combine that with Amenotejikara and the FoV extension mechanism of the Paths of Pain. This is the godlike power that Sasuke deserves.\n\nAsura Path - What happened to sprouting extra arms? Sasuke literally had the chance to get his arm back for free. Having two arms is an objective combat advantage over having only one regardless of the opponent; Boruto stans don't understand this.\n\nPreta Path - Sasuke could absorb chakra from some of Naruto's Shadow Clones to replenish himself, instead of complaining that he \"rAn ouT oF ChAkRA\"\n\nAnimal Path - That self-replicating dog that CANNOT die would be useful as a distraction, a tank, and FoV extender. He could switch places with this dog any time he's about to receive a crippling/fatal attack.\n\nNaraka Path - Sasuke could heal allies with the King of Hell. Anyone with otherwise-irreversible damage could be restored to fighting condition within seconds.\n\nDeva Path - Objectively useful as either direct attack or utility; e.g., if Shinra Tensei can be scaled to Six Paths level, it can actually threaten Isshiki. If not, then it still has a use in pushing away chakra rods, or allies away from enemy attack. Same goes for Bansho Tenin; it could make dodging attacks harder for any enemy, even Isshiki; even if he can resist the force, he would still be slowed down trying to resist it. Bansho can then be synergized with Ameno to land attacks that Isshiki would have a hard time getting away from, since he's being actively pulled towards the attack.\n\nHuman Path - Imagine that, Amenotejikara to the opponent and then touch them with the Human Path. This instakills anyone who isn't an Otsutsuki. GG.\n\nSo many other methods through which Naruto and Sasuke could have performed better, methods that were clearly within their respective arsenals. These Boruto stans who disagree with this clearly don't even know their subjects well. Their childlike minds simply cannot understand that Kodachi wrote the older generation with the worst possible faith.",
