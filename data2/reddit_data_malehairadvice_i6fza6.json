There's always a couple stray hairs left wherever I go and that kinda grosses me out. My family complains about how it looks (which really shouldn't bother me, but it still does). Several women mentioned to me in passing that while people think long hair is cool and will compliment you on it, very few find it actually attractive on a guy. Those comments kinda bother me too. Most guys are 100% for it though and beg me not to chop it. So what ever shall I do? I am getting a little bored of it as well, but would also hate to lose the past four years of growth...",

Try more, seriously.        \nAs I got older, and I assume my hair got thinner, wax or gel really didn't work for me anymore but luckily I found a fibre-putty which works perfectly for me.

When I'm conditioning in the shower, I finger-comb the conditioner through, which effectively grabs a ton of loose hairs, and then I can just gather them up into a ball and throw away. I found that in the long run, this has been way better for my shower drain as well.\n\nD) If all else fails, chop chop. Hair grows back.",

I think all it needs is trimming back two or three inches (no higher than mid-chest), and a regular trim every four weeks. A cut can really breathe new life into long hair, especially with regular maintenance. If you're already doing regular trims, disregard this bit -- I don't live your life. I used to have very long hair like yours, except it was curly enough to form ringlets, so I had to put more fuss into maintaining it than was worth it for me.\n\nIf you're desperate for shorter hair, crop to your shoulders first and see how it goes. You can find nice clip-in extensions if you want to experiment with having your firelord looks without the mess of always having long hair. The fact is, you can always go back and cut more off, but you can't put it back on again.",

He really pulls it off like you do. If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it! Asian guys with long hair = so sexy. If you really want a change, just cut a little and see how you feel. It can be kinda traumatic to cut long hair completely short all at once. I did it one time, and I cried for like a year!",

If you decide to cut it, I would just do it stepwise to see if you like any other length in between because once you buzz it, you will never ever go through years of growing it again I bet...",
