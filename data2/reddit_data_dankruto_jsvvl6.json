They know he has a sharingan and he is a S ranked criminal, anyone with a sharingan is dangerous, and itachi was an anbu captain at 13.

Gai is the strongest in this picture (with 8 gates) with Obito being 2nd, but I do think Obito would still win. Even though someone like 10 tails madara almost died fighting him, Obito still has a chance because of the nature of Kamui. The 8 gates only last within a certain time frame, and Kamui can last for 5 minutes at a time. If Obito has a chance to breath for even a second, he can reset his 5 minutes and wait it out until Gai just dies.",

They know he has a sharingan and he is a S ranked criminal, anyone with a sharingan is dangerous, and itachi was an anbu captain at 13.

The 8 gates only last within a certain time frame, and Kamui can last for 5 minutes at a time. If Obito has a chance to breath for even a second, he can reset his 5 minutes and wait it out until Gai just dies.",

They know he has a sharingan and he is a S ranked criminal, anyone with a sharingan is dangerous, and itachi was an anbu captain at 13.

When fighting sasuke the raikage's assistant (other than Darui) recognized the mangekyo as did the raikage. So the Uchiha's mangekyo was known to a lot of people. The only thing is that no one knows how exactly the mangekyo works. \n\n\n>Also he didn\u2019t gain it from killing his parents, he got it from seeing Shisui kill himself.\n\nI know, I put a 'disclaimer' in parentheses saying that I know that's the case. What I meant to get across is they know that one has to kill someone close to them to gain the mangekyo, itachi killed his parents so they should have guessed that he may have awakened his mangekyo. Know what I mean?",

They know he has a sharingan and he is a S ranked criminal, anyone with a sharingan is dangerous, and itachi was an anbu captain at 13. Kurenei just charged in like she was stronger than him, she underestimated his genjutsu prowess which was leagues above her. Thats the stupid part of it",

When fighting sasuke the raikage's assistant (other than Darui) recognized the mangekyo as did the raikage. So the Uchiha's mangekyo was known to a lot of people. The only thing is that no one knows how exactly the mangekyo works. \n\n\n>Also he didn\u2019t gain it from killing his parents, he got it from seeing Shisui kill himself.\n\nI know, I put a 'disclaimer' in parentheses saying that I know that's the case. What I meant to get across is they know that one has to kill someone close to them to gain the mangekyo, itachi killed his parents so they should have guessed that he may have awakened his mangekyo. Know what I mean?",

            "body": ">Or really knew it was a thing.\n\nA lot of people actually did. When fighting sasuke the raikage's assistant (other than Darui) recognized the mangekyo as did the raikage. So the Uchiha's mangekyo was known to a lot of people. The only thing is that no one knows how exactly the mangekyo works. \n\n\n>Also he didn\u2019t gain it from killing his parents, he got it from seeing Shisui kill himself.\n\nI know, I put a 'disclaimer' in parentheses saying that I know that's the case. What I meant to get across is they know that one has to kill someone close to them to gain the mangekyo, itachi killed his parents so they should have guessed that he may have awakened his mangekyo. Know what I mean?",
