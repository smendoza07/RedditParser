    "body": "I am newly divorced at 27, and a friend told me about SA, so I created an account last week to check it out. I wasn\u2019t really sure of what my expectations were, but after a lot of messages from many guys, I ended up reaching out to this extremely good looking man in his 50\u2019s that lived 15 minutes away from me.\n\nWe talked and went to texting, we agreed to do a M&G last night. I honestly thought he was a catfish.. but! I asked him to FaceTime me before we met and he was real! \n\nWe met at Starbucks, it felt like an immediate connection. We went to his house after and talked for hours getting to know each other. He was such a gentleman, very sweet, kind, caring. We kissed, but left it at that. We discussed allowance and he will be taking me out this weekend again.\n\nI am very excited to have found a connection with someone so quickly and see where it will lead.",

It also leaves the woman insecure because of variability.",

Curious if you will answer a question for me.  I've been told this a few times, and was told again last night at a very successful first meet.\n\nDoes his pictures do him justice?  Like, you saw his pictures and said, \"extremely good looking\".  You seem super excited to see him in live video and that it wasn't like a fake picture or something.\n\nTell me please, when you saw him in person were your expectations exceeded even more about his looks?   I feel like this is an important ingredient, so would like your thoughts on it!\n\nWelcome and Congrats!",
