I had most of the back just over an inch and the front a few inches long for curls/volume & texture in the front. Recently chopped the top bc it was getting too long and I love how it is currently. I think your hair would look nice with some shorter locks in the front like the bottom right picture and keep the rest the same length. If the top/front gets too fluffy on some days and doesn't behave or gets in the way, I think you should at least trim it. If you do it yourself you can take a little bit off at a time and wait a few days to see if you want to take any more off. I feel like it's much easier to cut your own hair if its curly/wavy bc the waves blend in together better and nothing will stand out if its uneven.",
