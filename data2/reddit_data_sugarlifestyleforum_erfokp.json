    "body": "Yeah the title is correct. I\u2019m talking about the young ones. The lovely ladies 18 through young 20s. \nThat\u2019s the age where you\u2019re:\n\nOld enough that you\u2019ve experienced sexual harassment/assault and have a fear of what a man could do to you but you\u2019re still unsure of how to prevent it. \n\nOld enough to have an idea of who you are but still learning confidence in being that person. \n\nOld enough to have the freedom to make your own choices but still to inexperienced to know which choices are smart and which choices are dumb. \n\nThese are crazy years for us. I know they were for me. So take it with a grain of salt when she flakes, you get ghosted, when she makes some real stupid choices. Sure it sucks for you but HELLO you wanted the pros of a baby sugar baby you also need to accept the cons. I\u2019m curious to hear others thoughts on this.",

But the day you have to actually put on clothes and walk out the door to the unknown, when the guy could be a murderer, creep, or worse - me.... I get it.  The men in sugar dating are successful people that have hard conversations most days of their life. Why they would ever lack the courage to say \"no\" over text, prior to a date, mystifies me.",

More because learning how to graciously let someone down is an important life skill that should come with experience. That being said, if he sets off warning bells, ghosting IMO is understandable no matter the age. \n\nfor the record if I was a young sb and ended up meeting you on a M&G and your personality was the same as it is on this forum it would be a wrap. \n\nI always wondered that about guys too.

Their bans are swift and arbitrary.  \n\n*You've canceled a couple times.  I'm going to pass.  Good luck.*\n\n*I met someone else I vibed more with.  I enjoyed meeting you.*\n\n*I wasn't feeling the chemistry at the m&g.  Good luck finding your SD.*  \n\nAny of these messages could go over well or it could enrage the rejected person.  Off they goes to Seeking to report/lie about you and you get banned.\n\nI imagine a lot of people ghost due to those fears.",

You have no real way of knowing what she's going through.\n\nI recall an article, study, or something that discussed when people should be allowed to drive, and the following point was made ( i cant remember the exact age groups fwiw) :\n\n16 year olds get in the most accidents of any age demographic.  But if you change the driving age from 16 to 18, then 18 year-olds get in the most accidents.  Change it from 18 to 26 and then 26 year olds will get in the most accidents.  And so on.  The point being, *experience* was more a driving factor, rather than *age*.\n\nAdd on to that that Sugaring is still considered taboo by many, then add onto that the fact that many men behave abhorrently on \\*any\\* online dating platform, and yeah... how could flaking not be a thing in the bowl?",

YES. i don't think i know any woman who hasn't had a man turn on them once he's been rejected. it's not like they're personally trying to offend you. it's more likely they're either in over their head or potentially scared of what the consequences could be when it comes to breaking the bad news.\n\nhave a little more compassion when in the situation YOU are the one who is much more the grown up compared to someone else who is largely still figuring life and themselves out.\n\nyes, they are adults and most of us would prefer others to stick to their words or at least notify us properly. at the end of the day, i'm not going to fault someone much younger than me for needing more time to figure out and gain their confidence. not everyone is as strong or together right away, and that's fine. we all move at different paces. the person who flaked clearly wasn't ready but hopefully the next person will be.\n\na lot of people sign up for seeking out of curiosity. it's free for women. we don't have to invest in it like men do. there's going to be a lot of people who dip their toe in but don't eventually pursue anything or meet anyone. if you want to up the chances of them not flaking, try to aim for those with more experience so there's a higher possibility of follow through.",

            "body": "I agree with you. Personally I\u2019ve had terrible experiences with ending things in just regular relationships. Men would threaten me for ending things with them or call me names that were extremely degrading and hurtful that eventually I just had to cut communication without giving any explanations.  This is the only way that I found to be safe and unfortunately I found comfort in it knowing that just blocking them and leaving without explanation would keep me safe. \nYes, I understand that the men on these sites are more matured and understanding but I have also had bad experiences on the site. \nFor example, one of the first men I started talking to was asking me to do things that were far out of my comfort zone. I explained that I was not interested in any of that and I wished him luck on his search. Within minutes I had received at least 10 messages from him saying how stupid I was for going on this website and not allowing men to do certain things to me (for context ...he was asking to give me a golden shower). Following that, he called me a whore and said he was going to post my photos all over and send it to my family (I wasn\u2019t too concerned because I didn\u2019t use my real name but in this day and age it isn\u2019t hard to find peoples information with just a photo). \nMy point is, have some sympathy. I understand how difficult and frustrating it can be when you spend time getting to know someone personally and making arrangements just for them to fall through without notice or explanation. I have had that happen to me with POT.  Realize that we are on this website to meet you guys as well but sometimes we really just get bad vibes from you and have had bad past experiences. \nNot trying to point fingers or blame anyone but maybe think about the way you\u2019re interacting with them. Are you being intimidating? Threatening? Overwhelming? Take a step back and realize there are multiple sides to every story!",

YES. i don't think i know any woman who hasn't had a man turn on them once he's been rejected. it's not like they're personally trying to offend you. it's more likely they're either in over their head or potentially scared of what the consequences could be when it comes to breaking the bad news.\n\nhave a little more compassion when in the situation YOU are the one who is much more the grown up compared to someone else who is largely still figuring life and themselves out.\n\nyes, they are adults and most of us would prefer others to stick to their words or at least notify us properly. at the end of the day, i'm not going to fault someone much younger than me for needing more time to figure out and gain their confidence. not everyone is as strong or together right away, and that's fine. we all move at different paces. the person who flaked clearly wasn't ready but hopefully the next person will be.\n\na lot of people sign up for seeking out of curiosity. it's free for women. we don't have to invest in it like men do. there's going to be a lot of people who dip their toe in but don't eventually pursue anything or meet anyone. if you want to up the chances of them not flaking, try to aim for those with more experience so there's a higher possibility of follow through.",

YES. i don't think i know any woman who hasn't had a man turn on them once he's been rejected. it's not like they're personally trying to offend you. it's more likely they're either in over their head or potentially scared of what the consequences could be when it comes to breaking the bad news.\n\nhave a little more compassion when in the situation YOU are the one who is much more the grown up compared to someone else who is largely still figuring life and themselves out.\n\nyes, they are adults and most of us would prefer others to stick to their words or at least notify us properly. at the end of the day, i'm not going to fault someone much younger than me for needing more time to figure out and gain their confidence. not everyone is as strong or together right away, and that's fine. we all move at different paces. the person who flaked clearly wasn't ready but hopefully the next person will be.\n\na lot of people sign up for seeking out of curiosity. it's free for women. we don't have to invest in it like men do. there's going to be a lot of people who dip their toe in but don't eventually pursue anything or meet anyone. if you want to up the chances of them not flaking, try to aim for those with more experience so there's a higher possibility of follow through.",
