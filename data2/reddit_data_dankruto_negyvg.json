He allowed Danzo to be Danzo, which in turn caused a whole lot of problems in the future\n\n\n2. He did not take care of Naruto. He could have definitely done better. If it wasn't for Jiraiya, Naruto would have been in deep shit later on after the Orochimaru encounter \n\n\n3. Hiruzen allowed Orochimaru to get away and didn't stop him or actively pursuit an arrest\n\n\n4.

If it weren\u2019t for his \u201cunrealistic/impossible\u201d dream there wouldn\u2019t be any villages. I think it takes the Unrealistic dreams to make it real. That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

He created the police force for Uchiha so they could put the village before the clan. Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

Whichever hokage succeeded the 1st was going to get that credit as long as they didn't completely fuck things up, it just happened to be Tobirama.

All he set up for the village shows that. But a big part of being Hokage is being a good politician. Neither him or Hashirama were good at that part. Hashirama was too soft and Tobirama was too much of an asshole. Don't get me wrong. He had plenty of reason for being an asshole. The way he grew up would do that to most people. \n\nA lot of people don't agree with me, but, had he lived, I think Minato would've been considered the greatest Hokage.

Plus he had to experiment with it to perfect it. How many people died because of it? Did they deserve to be a sacrifice? Does it really matter? Any jutsu that requires you to sacrifice someone's life right off the bat is sketchy at best.\n\nThe other jutsu are awesome. Not denying that. And one could argue that a lot of the damage done by the Edo Tensei was made up for with the Shadow Clone jutsu. Without it Naruto wouldn't have gotten very far. Probably would've died really young. The ninja world would look like a much different place without the Shadow Clone jutsu.\n\nOne thing has always kinda bugged me about the Shadow Clone jutsu. Naruto learns it from the sacred scroll he normally never would've touched. Supposed to be very limited access to that knowledge. Then after the time skip it seems like everyone and their dog(literally Akamaru) knows how to do it.",

Maybe he lied and just used the clone jutsu to scare them away. I don't think that one has been explicitly explained. Shizune and Konohamaru both use it in the anime. Not in the manga though.\n\nI know the multi shadow clone is forbidden because it can kill the user because of how you have to distribute your chakra among them. They nuever really explain what you need to know rouse the multiple version instead of just the single. So maybe everyone who knows how to do the shadow clone knows how to do the multiple version too but they don't because they don't have massive chakra reserves like Naruto and might kill themselves. Or not. I'm just speculating at this point.",

They killed quite a number as well. You gotta wonder how far Obito would've actually gotten trying to control the ten tails by himself. Obito and Madara together had a tough time directing it with both of them. If he'd even get far enough to summon the ten tails. Without Edo Tensei he wouldn't have the nine tails chakra from the two brothers that he used in place of a complete nine tails.  And yes, the Hokage, most likely the ones Kabuto summoned as well, were brought back with artificial life. This particular time. But before that they had to use a person as a sacrifice. Orochimaru used a couple of his lackeys. He didn't give a crap. But Tobirama developed it using living people as a sacrifice. That's some shaky ground, morally speaking.

Doesn't mean power, but if there is a such power I would ask you to enlighten me. More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Their powers together are the requirements for casting the most powerful jutsu, such as the Infinite Tsukuyomi, and the sealing jutsu that sealed away Kaguya. Essentially, their powers together mimick Otsusuki power.\n\nThe Uzumaki clan is strong because of their relation to the Senju.\n\nThe Hyuga, the fourth most powerful clan, has the byakugan, which is also something that the Otsusuki had. The top 4 most powerful clans can all be traced back to some relation to the Otsusuki.\n\nAll the other clans happen to be not as remarkable. That's not a coincidence.

So it\u2019s reasonable to assume the world of Naruto is an all-Japanese world with a much larger racial diversity.",

If you watch Boruto, you'd think that Naruto's generation is the only one that intermarried with diferent clans and villages, since there's not a lot of genetic diversity going on previously.\n\nI mean, you really mean to tell me that an Uchiha never found a Hyuga attractive and wondered what would happen if they had a child that potentially had a Sharingan AND a Byakugan?  \n\nIt doesn't really matter ultimately, since it's not the focus of the story. Kishi's reasoning for Naruto being blonde probably doesn't go further than \"I just thought he'd look cool\". It is fun to speculate and poke holes tho.",

Admittedly he lost much of his reaction time without his sharingan, but his speed is still up there in the top. \n\nKakashi and Guy VS the 7 swordsmen, Kakashi\u2019s usage of Kenjutsu was superior to the 7 *swordsmen* of the mist. I also remembered about that Samurai Leader, so Kakashi is at 3rd not 2nd in Kenjutsu, but that\u2019s still going to outclass Hiruzen\u2019s weapon mastery if they decide to fight with weapons. Enma gives a big advantage, but Kakashi\u2019s summons aren\u2019t douches either",

Not to mention, his incredible feat of beating Orochimaru and the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time happened WAY after his prime, he did that in his late sixties.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to downplay Kakashi here, I\u2019m just saying that for as bad of a Hokage Hiruzen was in terms of ruling, he more than made up for it in absolute power.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Learn the difference. There is a big one between them.\nThird,he is the one who acknowledged the Uchiha clan and their,love,power and hatred - how the Sharingan works.\n\n\nTell me, Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\",if he was scared of them,as you say (this one **must** be a joke for sure),would he be working with Sasuke? Would he be working with Kagami,be his teammate and give his life away for him and the others,so they can survive? Would he understand and acknowledge Itachi's decision and actions? Would he  even be mad that the Uchihas ended up dead? Would he smile and acknowledge Madara for admitting his mistakes and be sorry for what he did? Would he believe that Sasuke would change and to become a part of Konoha again? Would he even give and pass his knowledge about the Uchiha clan,every single detail and story to Sasuke? Would he understand them *even better* than Hashirama?\n*Would he do ANYTHING of the above if he was \"*scared*\" as you said???*\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no and no.\n\n\n\"Scared\" for Tobirama and the point we are talking about isn't the right word... It's far from true.\n\n\nIf that's what you call a \"joke\" (sarcasm),then no, I don't understand it. Because even if you say that you know that racist is awful,you still put it in your-so-called \"jokes\".\nJust because he was cautious, doesn't make him racist or scared. That doesn't make him N2 Trump. That doesn't make him whatever y'all write him as.\n\n\nAnd Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\", iam not a kid.\nGo tell your awful grammar to someone else.\nIf you are in an argument,then I'd ask you to prove your points with facts,and not attacking personally with offensive words... If you want to argue or say something against a given character,then it'd be better if you watch/read about him more,\u0432ecause otherwise you're pretending to be a clown.\n\n\nMr. \"Jesus Christ lol\",i ask you politely to stop swearing(i mean the offensive words you said) and instead to have a normal debate.

The biggest thing against Hashirama is letting Madara live that long before actually killing him. They had multiple fights. See the difference with Hashi and Madara is that they were enemies. Naruto and Sasuke did not start off as enemies. They were teammates. Sasuke could be redeemed but Madara could not. Madara surviving so long gave him time to unlock Rinnegan and time to plot. This lead to the 4th war while Hashi giving the other nations tailed beast lead to other wars",

That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

He created the police force for Uchiha so they could put the village before the clan. Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

All he set up for the village shows that. But a big part of being Hokage is being a good politician. Neither him or Hashirama were good at that part. Hashirama was too soft and Tobirama was too much of an asshole. Don't get me wrong. He had plenty of reason for being an asshole. The way he grew up would do that to most people. \n\nA lot of people don't agree with me, but, had he lived, I think Minato would've been considered the greatest Hokage.

Plus he had to experiment with it to perfect it. How many people died because of it? Did they deserve to be a sacrifice? Does it really matter? Any jutsu that requires you to sacrifice someone's life right off the bat is sketchy at best.\n\nThe other jutsu are awesome. Not denying that. And one could argue that a lot of the damage done by the Edo Tensei was made up for with the Shadow Clone jutsu. Without it Naruto wouldn't have gotten very far. Probably would've died really young. The ninja world would look like a much different place without the Shadow Clone jutsu.\n\nOne thing has always kinda bugged me about the Shadow Clone jutsu. Naruto learns it from the sacred scroll he normally never would've touched. Supposed to be very limited access to that knowledge. Then after the time skip it seems like everyone and their dog(literally Akamaru) knows how to do it.",

I'm not gonna claim that I have extensive knowledge about Naruto and it's world. \n\nKakashi uses it as a bluff to scare away Gato's thugs after Zabusa kills Gato. Maybe he lied and just used the clone jutsu to scare them away. I don't think that one has been explicitly explained. Shizune and Konohamaru both use it in the anime. Not in the manga though.\n\nI know the multi shadow clone is forbidden because it can kill the user because of how you have to distribute your chakra among them. They nuever really explain what you need to know rouse the multiple version instead of just the single. So maybe everyone who knows how to do the shadow clone knows how to do the multiple version too but they don't because they don't have massive chakra reserves like Naruto and might kill themselves. Or not. I'm just speculating at this point.",

They killed quite a number as well. You gotta wonder how far Obito would've actually gotten trying to control the ten tails by himself. Obito and Madara together had a tough time directing it with both of them. If he'd even get far enough to summon the ten tails. Without Edo Tensei he wouldn't have the nine tails chakra from the two brothers that he used in place of a complete nine tails.  And yes, the Hokage, most likely the ones Kabuto summoned as well, were brought back with artificial life. This particular time. But before that they had to use a person as a sacrifice. Orochimaru used a couple of his lackeys. He didn't give a crap. But Tobirama developed it using living people as a sacrifice. That's some shaky ground, morally speaking.

Tell me, which other clan had such power? Yamanaka sold flowers, Akicmichi food products, Nara had deers and Hyuga were isolated and powerless. But those poooor oppressed Uchiha had power of law enforcement and massive influence in ANBU.\n\nIt's not everyone's and their moms' obligation to coddle the Uchiha and Tobirama was already too generous to them.",

Doesn't mean power, but if there is a such power I would ask you to enlighten me. More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

The Otsusuki were the most powerful clan, as they were closest related to Kaguya, who is the ultimately the mother of all chakra.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju are the closest related to the Otsusuki. Their powers together are the requirements for casting the most powerful jutsu, such as the Infinite Tsukuyomi, and the sealing jutsu that sealed away Kaguya. Essentially, their powers together mimick Otsusuki power.\n\nThe Uzumaki clan is strong because of their relation to the Senju.\n\nThe Hyuga, the fourth most powerful clan, has the byakugan, which is also something that the Otsusuki had. The top 4 most powerful clans can all be traced back to some relation to the Otsusuki.\n\nAll the other clans happen to be not as remarkable. That's not a coincidence. They're weaker because their blood is less pure.",

Admittedly he lost much of his reaction time without his sharingan, but his speed is still up there in the top. \n\nKakashi and Guy VS the 7 swordsmen, Kakashi\u2019s usage of Kenjutsu was superior to the 7 *swordsmen* of the mist. I also remembered about that Samurai Leader, so Kakashi is at 3rd not 2nd in Kenjutsu, but that\u2019s still going to outclass Hiruzen\u2019s weapon mastery if they decide to fight with weapons. Enma gives a big advantage, but Kakashi\u2019s summons aren\u2019t douches either",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Would he be working with Kagami,be his teammate and give his life away for him and the others,so they can survive? Would he understand and acknowledge Itachi's decision and actions? Would he  even be mad that the Uchihas ended up dead? Would he smile and acknowledge Madara for admitting his mistakes and be sorry for what he did? Would he believe that Sasuke would change and to become a part of Konoha again? Would he even give and pass his knowledge about the Uchiha clan,every single detail and story to Sasuke? Would he understand them *even better* than Hashirama?\n*Would he do ANYTHING of the above if he was \"*scared*\" as you said???*\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no and no.\n\n\n\"Scared\" for Tobirama and the point we are talking about isn't the right word... It's far from true.\n\n\nIf that's what you call a \"joke\" (sarcasm),then no, I don't understand it. Because even if you say that you know that racist is awful,you still put it in your-so-called \"jokes\".\nJust because he was cautious, doesn't make him racist or scared. That doesn't make him N2 Trump. That doesn't make him whatever y'all write him as.\n\n\nAnd Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\", iam not a kid.\nGo tell your awful grammar to someone else.\nIf you are in an argument,then I'd ask you to prove your points with facts,and not attacking personally with offensive words... If you want to argue or say something against a given character,then it'd be better if you watch/read about him more,\u0432ecause otherwise you're pretending to be a clown.\n\n\nMr. \"Jesus Christ lol\",i ask you politely to stop swearing(i mean the offensive words you said) and instead to have a normal debate. Ok?",

That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

He created the police force for Uchiha so they could put the village before the clan. Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

Not denying what he did for the village but he never would've had that chance if Hashirama hadn't started the whole village/nation thing.\n\nHe was a really good administrator. All he set up for the village shows that. But a big part of being Hokage is being a good politician. Neither him or Hashirama were good at that part. Hashirama was too soft and Tobirama was too much of an asshole. Don't get me wrong. He had plenty of reason for being an asshole. The way he grew up would do that to most people. \n\nA lot of people don't agree with me, but, had he lived, I think Minato would've been considered the greatest Hokage. Dude was just getting started as Hokage when he died.",

I'm not gonna claim that I have extensive knowledge about Naruto and it's world. \n\nKakashi uses it as a bluff to scare away Gato's thugs after Zabusa kills Gato. Maybe he lied and just used the clone jutsu to scare them away. I don't think that one has been explicitly explained. Shizune and Konohamaru both use it in the anime. Not in the manga though.\n\nI know the multi shadow clone is forbidden because it can kill the user because of how you have to distribute your chakra among them. They nuever really explain what you need to know rouse the multiple version instead of just the single. So maybe everyone who knows how to do the shadow clone knows how to do the multiple version too but they don't because they don't have massive chakra reserves like Naruto and might kill themselves. Or not. I'm just speculating at this point.",

You gotta wonder how far Obito would've actually gotten trying to control the ten tails by himself. Obito and Madara together had a tough time directing it with both of them. If he'd even get far enough to summon the ten tails. Without Edo Tensei he wouldn't have the nine tails chakra from the two brothers that he used in place of a complete nine tails.  And yes, the Hokage, most likely the ones Kabuto summoned as well, were brought back with artificial life. This particular time. But before that they had to use a person as a sacrifice. Orochimaru used a couple of his lackeys. He didn't give a crap. But Tobirama developed it using living people as a sacrifice. That's some shaky ground, morally speaking.

Doesn't mean power, but if there is a such power I would ask you to enlighten me. More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning.\u201d\n\nIn the feudal times of Naruto, when the uchihas and senju were at war, the clans were considered separate races.

Kishi's reasoning for Naruto being blonde probably doesn't go further than \"I just thought he'd look cool\". It is fun to speculate and poke holes tho.",

Not to mention, his incredible feat of beating Orochimaru and the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time happened WAY after his prime, he did that in his late sixties.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to downplay Kakashi here, I\u2019m just saying that for as bad of a Hokage Hiruzen was in terms of ruling, he more than made up for it in absolute power.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Would he be working with Kagami,be his teammate and give his life away for him and the others,so they can survive? Would he understand and acknowledge Itachi's decision and actions? Would he  even be mad that the Uchihas ended up dead? Would he smile and acknowledge Madara for admitting his mistakes and be sorry for what he did? Would he believe that Sasuke would change and to become a part of Konoha again? Would he even give and pass his knowledge about the Uchiha clan,every single detail and story to Sasuke? Would he understand them *even better* than Hashirama?\n*Would he do ANYTHING of the above if he was \"*scared*\" as you said???*\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no and no.\n\n\n\"Scared\" for Tobirama and the point we are talking about isn't the right word...

The biggest thing against Hashirama is letting Madara live that long before actually killing him. They had multiple fights. See the difference with Hashi and Madara is that they were enemies. Naruto and Sasuke did not start off as enemies. They were teammates. Sasuke could be redeemed but Madara could not. Madara surviving so long gave him time to unlock Rinnegan and time to plot. This lead to the 4th war while Hashi giving the other nations tailed beast lead to other wars",

That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

He created the police force for Uchiha so they could put the village before the clan. Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

Maybe he lied and just used the clone jutsu to scare them away. I don't think that one has been explicitly explained. Shizune and Konohamaru both use it in the anime. Not in the manga though.\n\nI know the multi shadow clone is forbidden because it can kill the user because of how you have to distribute your chakra among them. They nuever really explain what you need to know rouse the multiple version instead of just the single. So maybe everyone who knows how to do the shadow clone knows how to do the multiple version too but they don't because they don't have massive chakra reserves like Naruto and might kill themselves.

You gotta wonder how far Obito would've actually gotten trying to control the ten tails by himself. Obito and Madara together had a tough time directing it with both of them. If he'd even get far enough to summon the ten tails. Without Edo Tensei he wouldn't have the nine tails chakra from the two brothers that he used in place of a complete nine tails.  And yes, the Hokage, most likely the ones Kabuto summoned as well, were brought back with artificial life. This particular time. But before that they had to use a person as a sacrifice. Orochimaru used a couple of his lackeys. He didn't give a crap. But Tobirama developed it using living people as a sacrifice. That's some shaky ground, morally speaking. All the other jutsu he invented don't come with the baggage the Edo Tensei does.",

Tell me, which other clan had such power? Yamanaka sold flowers, Akicmichi food products, Nara had deers and Hyuga were isolated and powerless. But those poooor oppressed Uchiha had power of law enforcement and massive influence in ANBU.\n\nIt's not everyone's and their moms' obligation to coddle the Uchiha and Tobirama was already too generous to them.",

The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Hiruzen\u2019s feats and even his rumours are only pale shadows of what Kakashi achieved. He has precisely 2 feats in the series, only one of which were remotely impressive.\n\nAlso those Edos were absolutely not 50%.... Hashirama at 50% would\u2019ve soloed the entire Hidden leaf + Hidden Sand + Hidden mist villages at the same time at the particular point. 50% Hashirama is basically at the same level as Edo Madara.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

If it weren\u2019t for his \u201cunrealistic/impossible\u201d dream there wouldn\u2019t be any villages. I think it takes the Unrealistic dreams to make it real. That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

He created the police force for Uchiha so they could put the village before the clan. Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

There is a big one between them.\nThird,he is the one who acknowledged the Uchiha clan and their,love,power and hatred - how the Sharingan works.\n\n\nTell me, Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\",if he was scared of them,as you say (this one **must** be a joke for sure),would he be working with Sasuke? Would he be working with Kagami,be his teammate and give his life away for him and the others,so they can survive? Would he understand and acknowledge Itachi's decision and actions? Would he  even be mad that the Uchihas ended up dead? Would he smile and acknowledge Madara for admitting his mistakes and be sorry for what he did? Would he believe that Sasuke would change and to become a part of Konoha again? Would he even give and pass his knowledge about the Uchiha clan,every single detail and story to Sasuke? Would he understand them *even better* than Hashirama?\n*Would he do ANYTHING of the above if he was \"*scared*\" as you said???*\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no and no.\n\n\n\"Scared\" for Tobirama and the point we are talking about isn't the right word... It's far from true.\n\n\nIf that's what you call a \"joke\" (sarcasm),then no, I don't understand it. Because even if you say that you know that racist is awful,you still put it in your-so-called \"jokes\".\nJust because he was cautious, doesn't make him racist or scared. That doesn't make him N2 Trump. That doesn't make him whatever y'all write him as.\n\n\nAnd Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\", iam not a kid.\nGo tell your awful grammar to someone else.\nIf you are in an argument,then I'd ask you to prove your points with facts,and not attacking personally with offensive words... If you want to argue or say something against a given character,then it'd be better if you watch/read about him more,\u0432ecause otherwise you're pretending to be a clown.\n\n\nMr. \"Jesus Christ lol\",i ask you politely to stop swearing(i mean the offensive words you said) and instead to have a normal debate.

That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly. Nevertheless I wish you the same.",

If you watch Boruto, you'd think that Naruto's generation is the only one that intermarried with diferent clans and villages, since there's not a lot of genetic diversity going on previously.\n\nI mean, you really mean to tell me that an Uchiha never found a Hyuga attractive and wondered what would happen if they had a child that potentially had a Sharingan AND a Byakugan?  \n\nIt doesn't really matter ultimately, since it's not the focus of the story. Kishi's reasoning for Naruto being blonde probably doesn't go further than \"I just thought he'd look cool\". It is fun to speculate and poke holes tho.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Would he be working with Kagami,be his teammate and give his life away for him and the others,so they can survive? Would he understand and acknowledge Itachi's decision and actions? Would he  even be mad that the Uchihas ended up dead? Would he smile and acknowledge Madara for admitting his mistakes and be sorry for what he did? Would he believe that Sasuke would change and to become a part of Konoha again? Would he even give and pass his knowledge about the Uchiha clan,every single detail and story to Sasuke? Would he understand them *even better* than Hashirama?\n*Would he do ANYTHING of the above if he was \"*scared*\" as you said???*\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no and no.\n\n\n\"Scared\" for Tobirama and the point we are talking about isn't the right word... It's far from true.\n\n\nIf that's what you call a \"joke\" (sarcasm),then no, I don't understand it. Because even if you say that you know that racist is awful,you still put it in your-so-called \"jokes\".\nJust because he was cautious, doesn't make him racist or scared. That doesn't make him N2 Trump. That doesn't make him whatever y'all write him as.\n\n\nAnd Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\", iam not a kid.\nGo tell your awful grammar to someone else.\nIf you are in an argument,then I'd ask you to prove your points with facts,and not attacking personally with offensive words... If you want to argue or say something against a given character,then it'd be better if you watch/read about him more,\u0432ecause otherwise you're pretending to be a clown.\n\n\nMr. \"Jesus Christ lol\",i ask you politely to stop swearing(i mean the offensive words you said) and instead to have a normal debate.

The biggest thing against Hashirama is letting Madara live that long before actually killing him. They had multiple fights. See the difference with Hashi and Madara is that they were enemies. Naruto and Sasuke did not start off as enemies. They were teammates. Sasuke could be redeemed but Madara could not. Madara surviving so long gave him time to unlock Rinnegan and time to plot. This lead to the 4th war while Hashi giving the other nations tailed beast lead to other wars",

If it weren\u2019t for his \u201cunrealistic/impossible\u201d dream there wouldn\u2019t be any villages. I think it takes the Unrealistic dreams to make it real. That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Not exactly a clean win for Kakashi there, he also couldn\u2019t use Kamui because they were in the Kamui Dimension already, but I won\u2019t count that since Kakashi couldn\u2019t use it either.\n\nI will give you that Kakashi is smarter than Hiruzen (though not being able to recognize Obito as Tobi was really dumb), but from what we know about Hiruzen is that he was the strongest Kage in the era when the overall strongest Kage lived. Not to mention, his incredible feat of beating Orochimaru and the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time happened WAY after his prime, he did that in his late sixties.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to downplay Kakashi here, I\u2019m just saying that for as bad of a Hokage Hiruzen was in terms of ruling, he more than made up for it in absolute power.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

There is a big one between them.\nThird,he is the one who acknowledged the Uchiha clan and their,love,power and hatred - how the Sharingan works.\n\n\nTell me, Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\",if he was scared of them,as you say (this one **must** be a joke for sure),would he be working with Sasuke? Would he be working with Kagami,be his teammate and give his life away for him and the others,so they can survive? Would he understand and acknowledge Itachi's decision and actions? Would he  even be mad that the Uchihas ended up dead? Would he smile and acknowledge Madara for admitting his mistakes and be sorry for what he did? Would he believe that Sasuke would change and to become a part of Konoha again? Would he even give and pass his knowledge about the Uchiha clan,every single detail and story to Sasuke? Would he understand them *even better* than Hashirama?\n*Would he do ANYTHING of the above if he was \"*scared*\" as you said???*\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no and no.\n\n\n\"Scared\" for Tobirama and the point we are talking about isn't the right word... It's far from true.\n\n\nIf that's what you call a \"joke\" (sarcasm),then no, I don't understand it. Because even if you say that you know that racist is awful,you still put it in your-so-called \"jokes\".\nJust because he was cautious, doesn't make him racist or scared. That doesn't make him N2 Trump. That doesn't make him whatever y'all write him as.\n\n\nAnd Mr.\"Jesus Christ lol\", iam not a kid.\nGo tell your awful grammar to someone else.\nIf you are in an argument,then I'd ask you to prove your points with facts,and not attacking personally with offensive words... If you want to argue or say something against a given character,then it'd be better if you watch/read about him more,\u0432ecause otherwise you're pretending to be a clown.\n\n\nMr. \"Jesus Christ lol\",i ask you politely to stop swearing(i mean the offensive words you said) and instead to have a normal debate. Ok?",

Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved.

Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village.

More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Hiruzen barely scrapes top 10. Kakashi has been shown to be able to do anything Hiruzen can but better. I just see absolutely no way that Hiruzen can be said to be more powerful than Kakashi",

Not exactly a clean win for Kakashi there, he also couldn\u2019t use Kamui because they were in the Kamui Dimension already, but I won\u2019t count that since Kakashi couldn\u2019t use it either.\n\nI will give you that Kakashi is smarter than Hiruzen (though not being able to recognize Obito as Tobi was really dumb), but from what we know about Hiruzen is that he was the strongest Kage in the era when the overall strongest Kage lived. Not to mention, his incredible feat of beating Orochimaru and the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time happened WAY after his prime, he did that in his late sixties.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to downplay Kakashi here, I\u2019m just saying that for as bad of a Hokage Hiruzen was in terms of ruling, he more than made up for it in absolute power.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

If it weren\u2019t for his \u201cunrealistic/impossible\u201d dream there wouldn\u2019t be any villages. I think it takes the Unrealistic dreams to make it real. That\u2019s where Madara went wrong right? Despite the dream being fulfilled, he still wasn\u2019t accepted by the other people. Instead of bearing the burden and leading the clan to unity he eventually rejected the dream believing it\u2019s unreachable. So, while it may have been unrealistic, it could have been achieved. It\u2019s not Hashiramas fault in fact that\u2019s what made him great and gave him the drive to be so powerful",

Madara of course could not do that. I would not put Hashi as the sole person behind creating the village. But you know kishi likes to contradict. Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village. He created a temporary world peace (technically world peace because they are fighting aliens) and brought back his best friend.",

More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Not exactly a clean win for Kakashi there, he also couldn\u2019t use Kamui because they were in the Kamui Dimension already, but I won\u2019t count that since Kakashi couldn\u2019t use it either.\n\nI will give you that Kakashi is smarter than Hiruzen (though not being able to recognize Obito as Tobi was really dumb), but from what we know about Hiruzen is that he was the strongest Kage in the era when the overall strongest Kage lived. Not to mention, his incredible feat of beating Orochimaru and the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time happened WAY after his prime, he did that in his late sixties.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to downplay Kakashi here, I\u2019m just saying that for as bad of a Hokage Hiruzen was in terms of ruling, he more than made up for it in absolute power.",

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy. He wanted to bring Sasuke back but also acknowledged taking care of the village.

More influential than other clans is also only true to an extent. The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly.

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy.

Back when it was written, the series had not yet become Dragon Ball, people weren\u2019t flying all over the place, moving at light speed and spamming laser beams at one another. It was back when the series was more grounded and things like chakra management and strategy actually were a thing.\n\nNow, you COULD argue that that is no excuse and that simply by later feats in the series, that characters are much more powerful than early show characters, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case in canon, that\u2019s just using video game logic (the fifth level boss MUST be stronger than the first level boss). We know that Orochimaru was the strongest of the Sannin, and from feats that we see later on in the series by both Jiraiya and Tsunade, we know that that means that peak Orochimaru is stronger than Sage Jiraiya, who was able to solo 3 Paths of Pain, and Tsunade, who is strong enough to punch through Madara\u2019s Susanoo. These are no small feats whatsoever, and this means that not only is Hiruzen strong enough to beat that, but he could do so at the old age of 68 (stated to be way past his prime) AND while fighting the 1st + 2nd Hokage at the same time AND while holding back since he didn\u2019t really want to kill Orochimaru.\n\nThe question of how diminished were Hashirama and Tobirama during that fight is highly speculative. Tobirama stated in the War Arc that he felt almost at full power even in Edo Tensei, and we also know that Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was stronger than Kabuto\u2019s, who only revived people at about 2/3 their original strength. That being said, within the series itself Hashirama\u2019s strength has been retconned and he is now the one called the \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d, a title that was also held by Hiruzen, whether this means that Kishimoto decided to nerf Hiruzen in-lore or decided to massively buff Hashirama in-lore remains up for debate. However, we know that at the time the Hiruzen vs Orochimaru fight was written, Hiruzen was the strongest Hokage of all time within the canon, so either way there\u2019s a huge contradiction within the series.\n\nWe can argue forever about how diminished Hashirama and Tobirama were in that fight and how maybe Orochimaru\u2019s Edo Tensei was not as strong back then and all that, but one thing we need to remember is that that was a fight Hiruzen HAD to win. Hiruzen was the only ninja alive in the village who could protect it from Orochimaru, so within the context and the logic of shounen anime as a whole, Hiruzen had all the motivation to go totally all out, while Hashirama and Tobirama were merely zombies fighting with no real motivation.",

Also what I mean is Hashirama is unrealistic by giving nukes to other nations who are unstable and untrustworthy. Tobirama was more of a realist because he knew this and he knew this with Madara. Tobirama will go the distance to do what he needs to do to save his village and maintain peace while Hashirama would pull punches. It took multiple battles and conflicts for Hashi to finally attempt to kill Madara. \n\n\nA further analysis would be Naruto. He's the GOAT because he balanced both Hashi and Tobirama philosophy.

The police force obviously had a place in the council since they're literally the police, but other than that it was a matter of population and position. F.e. the leader of the barrier thing was also part of the council as far as Im concerned and that wasnf coz of any specific clan. \nAlso yeah they had much influence. They were only the probably biggest clan and the founders of the village. Still mainly equal to the rest. \n\n>It's obvious you want to keep making excuses for the Uchiha against all canon material.\n\nThis is funny to me on multiple aspects. 1. I love how you literally wrote something about people getting so worked up over fictional \"race\" stuff 2. I'm not making excuses as far as I know since I myself ain't the biggest fan of the clan, i just think you and some others judge them too harshly or, in your case, straight up unreasonably resent them and anyone who ever enjoyed a single one of them. As someone who enjoys well written characters, i like it when they have flaws, which is why I like some of the Uchihas but also many other characters. \nYes the Uchihas did a lot of dumb shit but it wasn't unreasonable. \nInfact I'd argue Sasuke and Madara are some of the most realistically written characters in any shonen I've seen so far.\n3. Literal Tobirama simp saying that lmao\n4. \"Canon material\" you've shown one anime frame congrats\n\n\n>Have a nice day/night.\n\nAlthough this conversation is certainty atleast partly in vain, I'm a bit disappointed to see you give up on your flawed view so quickly. Nevertheless I wish you the same.",

He was trained directly by the 2nd strongest Hokage, was also the strongest kage alive at his time, faced literal gods and won, would stomp any of the Sanin by the end of his war arc, was acknowledged by very very high rank king shinobi all across the world (Zabuza, Darui, Raikage, the entire land of fire council, 5 members of the Akatsuki, including Pain (who viewed him as a potential threat!) and more), knew all 5 nature releases as well as Ying Yang, had among the best speed feats in the series (speed blitz Kaguya who even Sasuke, with his rinnegan, could barely react to), among the highest intelligence in the series (states to be more intelligent than Shikamaru), one of the most impressive chakra feats in the series (1 day quartz wall). Hiruzen\u2019s feats and even his rumours are only pale shadows of what Kakashi achieved. He has precisely 2 feats in the series, only one of which were remotely impressive.\n\nAlso those Edos were absolutely not 50%.... Hashirama at 50% would\u2019ve soloed the entire Hidden leaf + Hidden Sand + Hidden mist villages at the same time at the particular point. 50% Hashirama is basically at the same level as Edo Madara.",
