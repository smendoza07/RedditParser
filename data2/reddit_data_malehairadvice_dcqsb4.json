Boom you look like a professional. The clothes don\u2019t have to be expensive, but go for like medium range in terms of pricing. Then get it tailored and fit to you. As for hair I would suggest growing it out on the top and possibly parting it think Matt Mercer if you know who that is (no offense) your hairline isn\u2019t the greatest and parting it helps with that. For the beard either grow it out or trim it more so it stays as stubble.",

Towel drying isn't too bad if you do it right.\n\nI'd imagine that you're just putting a towel in between your head and your hands and moving them all over as if you were scratching a dog. Vigorously rubbing your wet hair with a towel can lead to excessive hair breakage and hair fall.\n\nIf you're going to towel dry, gently pat it down while letting it air dry. An extra 5-10 minutes of drying your hair isn't going to kill you - instead of moving your hands all over the place like you're a black woman praising Jesus on a Sunday morning, try a gentle pat, press, and move on. Next spot of the head - pat, press, and move on.\n\nYou want your hair to know it's valued & respected and that you're going to give it the loving it deserves instead of taking it to pound town like it's your meat on a Friday night.",

Get some kind of hair thickener because it'll make you look great. The kind that increases the diameter of each hair strand, and washes off after. Apply it to wet hair, blowdry up, and it should stay that way. Add a VERY SMALL amount of pomade or another gel that isn't too strong to hold it in place. After you apply everything, (optional, you might like the messy look) just brush through the very front of your hair (not throughout your hair, just the front)\n\nWhen you get a haircut, tell her \"number 4 on the sides and back\" I think would be a good look for you. Keep the front/middle as is, or a slight trim if you have hair breakage or something",

Towel drying isn't too bad if you do it right.\n\nI'd imagine that you're just putting a towel in between your head and your hands and moving them all over as if you were scratching a dog. Vigorously rubbing your wet hair with a towel can lead to excessive hair breakage and hair fall.\n\nIf you're going to towel dry, gently pat it down while letting it air dry. An extra 5-10 minutes of drying your hair isn't going to kill you - instead of moving your hands all over the place like you're a black woman praising Jesus on a Sunday morning, try a gentle pat, press, and move on. Next spot of the head - pat, press, and move on.\n\nYou want your hair to know it's valued & respected and that you're going to give it the loving it deserves instead of taking it to pound town like it's your meat on a Friday night.",

Towel drying isn't too bad if you do it right.\n\nI'd imagine that you're just putting a towel in between your head and your hands and moving them all over as if you were scratching a dog. Vigorously rubbing your wet hair with a towel can lead to excessive hair breakage and hair fall.\n\nIf you're going to towel dry, gently pat it down while letting it air dry. An extra 5-10 minutes of drying your hair isn't going to kill you - instead of moving your hands all over the place like you're a black woman praising Jesus on a Sunday morning, try a gentle pat, press, and move on. Next spot of the head - pat, press, and move on.\n\nYou want your hair to know it's valued & respected and that you're going to give it the loving it deserves instead of taking it to pound town like it's your meat on a Friday night.",
