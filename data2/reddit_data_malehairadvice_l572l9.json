I think you should grow it, male hair goes through an \u201cawkward phase\u201d where it\u2019s in between short and long and becomes hard to put any characteristic definition into. You\u2019re pulling out of that phase at the moment, so I say keep going with that long hair look. This is all just my opinion, btw. I\u2019m no hair care specialist, but I have grown my hair well past shoulder length and proceeded to get it cut short many many times in my life, so I\u2019m familiar with different lengths and so far long is my favourite.",

Otherwise the long look is great if you can rock it with confidence.\n\nMy only reccomendation for the second option is to take a little volume off the top. Kind of skews your head shape with the way it looks in that second pic.\n\nAlso, have you considered a buzz cut? You have the face shape for it. Hair's great you know, try to make it an individual thing (I mean, if you wanna conform that's cool too). You can style/cut/shave it in so many different ways it's not even funny. So figure out how you wanna express yourself and go from there.",

And it's definitely not easy to maintain or have the patience for it to grow. I'm trying to go at least mid-back length, but it's really up to you.\n\nYou look great both ways, but even the composition and pose of the second photo make it a better shot of you, so take that into account when comparing it to a bathroom selfie with a bit of frizz.",
