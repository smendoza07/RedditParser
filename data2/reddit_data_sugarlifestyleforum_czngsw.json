    "body": "This doesn't only appear to be happening in my area, so maybe you can pick up this fun hobby as well ;)\n\nAs of late (the last 2 weeks or so) it seems that every new POT SB who has signed up in my area is either looking for platonic or online only. \n\nI usually let the online folks go but lately I've had too much time on my hands so I've made a fun little game out of it.\n\nNow I reach out and simply ask them - Hey are you looking for an in person arrangement here in XXX (my city), or are you looking for online only?\n\nWhen they reply online only, I screenshot the convo, hit report user, inappropriate conduct and there is a section for online only. I attach the screen shot and poof they disappear.  \n\nI get it's not the nicest thing to do, but if SA is going to keep charging me $80 for what now is more like vanilla dating sites, I'm going to make them earn their money.\n\nHappy hunting.",

I had a so called \u201cSD\u201d offer me a choice between going out to a nice dinner once a month and have a budget of $100 for the meal, or just directly give me the cash once a month and we would just hang out at his place and watch movies. $100. One hundred dollars. Per month. Now I understand most SDs are not millionaires, but come on. Like why even use SA at that point? When I carefully questioned if he was really interested in the sugar lifestyle, he blew up on me and said \u201csome women actually appreciate my offer,\u201d and told me I should never contact him again.",

Seeking would be a better place if all these groups were gone.\n\nHow do you know if when you report them they are banned?  The report function on SA automatically blocks them so you can no longer see their profile.  Making a separate account can let you know for sure who has or has not been actually removed from the site.\n\nUnfortunately, SB memberships are free and easy for them to come back with a new profile, but at least this will annoy them and hopefully chase them away.",

And the best part? The AI will be segregated to its own AI matrix, where you (and only you) can have a relationship with her (no mixing of bits - unless you want her to have a BFF to play with you online?). The personality eventually evolves and becomes tuned entirely to you.\n\nShe'll come complete with the same cognitive-dissonance we've come to expect from phases of the moon, menstrual cycles and other non-sequitors of \"WTF just happened?\" along with the appropriate \"make-up texts\" complete with back story of cousin dying or is injured - but making a full recovery.\n\nI mean, if you're not going to actually BE THERE to enrich a person's life? You're going to get replaced with technology. Simple as that. \n\nHell, I could even see the AI learning you're home with a cold and viola, there's an Uber Eat's showed up at your door with soup from yours (or hers) fave restaurant and a cute little text pops up on your phone \"hope you like!\" with all the emojis and hearts your sense of denial of reality can stomach. \n\nI kid you not.

Plus there\u2019s way more possibility for one of the parties involved to be catfished or scammed by someone they\u2019ve never met and have no idea is even real.\n\nPlatonic is allowed on Seeking, but the reality is, most will never find a platonic daddy.  According to recent statistics there is one premium sugar daddy for every 10 sugar active babies. Out of those premium sugar daddies many of them are really just John\u2019s looking for an escort, or scammers trying to scam na\u00efve women. So the likelihood is it\u2019s probably more like 20 or 30 sugar babies for every 1 real sugar daddy. \n\nNow out of 1000 real sugar daddies maybe one is platonic. But at least 35 or 40% of new sugar babies that join want a platonic SR. So now the likelihood of them actually finding a platonic sugar daddy makes it even more unlikely then a SB that wants a regular SR with intimacy, because now instead of having 20 or 30 to 1 odds, it\u2019s more like 10,000 to 12,000 to 1 odds. Basically they\u2019re trying to find a unicorn SD.\n\nMost women that say they\u2019ve had a platonic sugar daddy are either \n\nA) lying \n\nB) had a SD they led on and rinsed & the SR never made it to intimacy \n\nC) has a SD that was playing the long game, taking a no pressure approach to getting a platonic SB to become intimate\n\nD) had a SD with no Game, that was dating a newbie SB, and never got to intimacy because they basically put themselves in the friend zone\n\nE) had a a SD with legitimate age or health related issues that prevent intimacy",

You never know who you\u2019re meeting... But you\u2019re right. That is against the rules on SA. Interesting to note. \n\nThanks for the answer!",

I can definitely provide her with career advice and market intelligence.  While I'm not interested in the vendor she works for, I can probably give her a couple of other leads.  We can talk about her career goals, Europe, and market intelligence.\n\nAs this would be professional dinner, I can't remotely say or do anything that would suggest a romantic interest but I think it could be a fun dinner.

The report function on SA automatically blocks them so you can no longer see their profile.

Plus there\u2019s way more possibility for one of the parties involved to be catfished or scammed by someone they\u2019ve never met and have no idea is even real.\n\nPlatonic is allowed on Seeking, but the reality is, most will never find a platonic daddy.  According to recent statistics there is one premium sugar daddy for every 10 sugar active babies. Out of those premium sugar daddies many of them are really just John\u2019s looking for an escort, or scammers trying to scam na\u00efve women. So the likelihood is it\u2019s probably more like 20 or 30 sugar babies for every 1 real sugar daddy. \n\nNow out of 1000 real sugar daddies maybe one is platonic. But at least 35 or 40% of new sugar babies that join want a platonic SR. So now the likelihood of them actually finding a platonic sugar daddy makes it even more unlikely then a SB that wants a regular SR with intimacy, because now instead of having 20 or 30 to 1 odds, it\u2019s more like 10,000 to 12,000 to 1 odds. Basically they\u2019re trying to find a unicorn SD.\n\nMost women that say they\u2019ve had a platonic sugar daddy are either \n\nA) lying \n\nB) had a SD they led on and rinsed & the SR never made it to intimacy \n\nC) has a SD that was playing the long game, taking a no pressure approach to getting a platonic SB to become intimate\n\nD) had a SD with no Game, that was dating a newbie SB, and never got to intimacy because they basically put themselves in the friend zone\n\nE) had a a SD with legitimate age or health related issues that prevent intimacy",

I can definitely provide her with career advice and market intelligence.  While I'm not interested in the vendor she works for, I can probably give her a couple of other leads.  We can talk about her career goals, Europe, and market intelligence.\n\nAs this would be professional dinner, I can't remotely say or do anything that would suggest a romantic interest but I think it could be a fun dinner.

Plus there\u2019s way more possibility for one of the parties involved to be catfished or scammed by someone they\u2019ve never met and have no idea is even real.\n\nPlatonic is allowed on Seeking, but the reality is, most will never find a platonic daddy.  According to recent statistics there is one premium sugar daddy for every 10 sugar active babies. Out of those premium sugar daddies many of them are really just John\u2019s looking for an escort, or scammers trying to scam na\u00efve women. So the likelihood is it\u2019s probably more like 20 or 30 sugar babies for every 1 real sugar daddy. \n\nNow out of 1000 real sugar daddies maybe one is platonic. But at least 35 or 40% of new sugar babies that join want a platonic SR. So now the likelihood of them actually finding a platonic sugar daddy makes it even more unlikely then a SB that wants a regular SR with intimacy, because now instead of having 20 or 30 to 1 odds, it\u2019s more like 10,000 to 12,000 to 1 odds. Basically they\u2019re trying to find a unicorn SD.\n\nMost women that say they\u2019ve had a platonic sugar daddy are either \n\nA) lying \n\nB) had a SD they led on and rinsed & the SR never made it to intimacy \n\nC) has a SD that was playing the long game, taking a no pressure approach to getting a platonic SB to become intimate\n\nD) had a SD with no Game, that was dating a newbie SB, and never got to intimacy because they basically put themselves in the friend zone\n\nE) had a a SD with legitimate age or health related issues that prevent intimacy",

I say, be honest with whoever you talk to, and maybe you can find someone one day. If you do decide you wanna be in this culture, be careful for the scammers tho! I respect you for staying civil this whole thread",

I can definitely provide her with career advice and market intelligence.  While I'm not interested in the vendor she works for, I can probably give her a couple of other leads.  We can talk about her career goals, Europe, and market intelligence.\n\nAs this would be professional dinner, I can't remotely say or do anything that would suggest a romantic interest but I think it could be a fun dinner.

She's very attractive, a couple of years out after graduating from a good state university, and wants to go to lunch. Looks like she did a year abroad in Europe in a place I've visited a few times.\n\nI'm sure she'd be happy to go to dinner too.  I can definitely provide her with career advice and market intelligence.  While I'm not interested in the vendor she works for, I can probably give her a couple of other leads.  We can talk about her career goals, Europe, and market intelligence.\n\nAs this would be professional dinner, I can't remotely say or do anything that would suggest a romantic interest but I think it could be a fun dinner.  And her company will buy!  I could probably have dinners like this 25 times a year if I wanted.",
