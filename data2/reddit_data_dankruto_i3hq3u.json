It parallels back to Asura and Indra, with Indra having unbelievable power but lacking in companionship while Asura had great companionship but lacked in power. In the case of the Senju vs Uchiha, I just assumed that the Senju were able to rival the Uchiha based on their great coordination skills and larger numbers, with Hashirama having access to unnatural powers due to him being a reincarnation of Asura, whom was entrusted with Six Paths power from his father. This relates back to wood style since it is probably based off of the divine tree, and six paths power originates from the divine tree, meaning that wood style probably exists because Hashirama inherited a tiny amount of six paths power through Asura's soul.\n\nSince Asura wasn't a powerful or unique person prior to being entrusted with power from his father, his descendants didn't inherit anything from his bloodline, while the powerful Indra whom unlocked his sharingan on his own was able to pass it down through genes as a kekkei genkai. On the other hand, reincarnations have the same chakra as the original Indra and Asura, and so they by extension have access to the same abilities as their past lives. This also relates back to how Madara was able to unlock his rinnegan from combining both chakras to recreate Hagaromo's chakra.",

Since natural chakra improve user chakra including control, user with perfecr chakra control combine with natural chakra can do jutsus which other way wouldnt be possible. You could say natural chakra is a temporary vessel of second natural chakra of your choose. Hashirama mastery of natural chakra is in his own league, took few seconds to become in sage mode conpare to naruto few minutes. Anyway once cause body to memorise that and you have it.. a artificial bloodline. Maybe in Hashirama body might be resident  a little of natural chakra because of mastery, it could explain why many people died while attempting to implant hashirama cells, because contained tiny ammount of natural chakra and code of wood relase, so that natural chakra was gathering without control. (Well afterall there is reason why anbu burn bodies, to avoid secrets). It also could explain why no other senju and his children didnt have one because it wasnt actual bloodline. Ofc this is my explanation to using in fanfic, but kinda plausible ( i guess, idk dont kill me).",

If not lower because 90% of the episodes are bad. I\u2019m hyped for the future of the anime, but for now it\u2019s no where near the other heavy hitters currently going on like My Hero, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, Tower of God, etc. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that, but when the majority say it\u2019s cheeks, it\u2019s probably some cheeks",

It\u2019s nothing personal and he\u2019s the type of person to thank you for putting up a good fight against him. The only personal beef he had (and got over pretty quickly tbh) was Tobirama. He could\u2019ve killed him out of vengeance and pulled a Sasuke but he was like nah, I\u2019m doing my own thing and if i can kill him on the way, that\u2019d be great. He didn\u2019t really care for his clan either. Other than his brothers, the only person he cared about was his other brother Hashirama but that was over pretty quickly too. He\u2019s just someone who had a goal and he was going to achieve it. Nothing personal, all business. So talk no jutsu on someone like him would be pretty much useless unless it\u2019s from Hashirama but Hashirama gave up on him a long time ago because he realized how useless it was. Not to say that his brothers\u2019 deaths didn\u2019t practically shape his goal, for a world where everything is fakely perfect. He was a still a person with feelings after all. \n\nAlthough I\u2019ve got to say that Hashirama\u2019s and Madara\u2019s talk at the end was one of my favorite parts of the whole series. Actually, their whole story is one of my favorites.",

It parallels back to Asura and Indra, with Indra having unbelievable power but lacking in companionship while Asura had great companionship but lacked in power. In the case of the Senju vs Uchiha, I just assumed that the Senju were able to rival the Uchiha based on their great coordination skills and larger numbers, with Hashirama having access to unnatural powers due to him being a reincarnation of Asura, whom was entrusted with Six Paths power from his father. This relates back to wood style since it is probably based off of the divine tree, and six paths power originates from the divine tree, meaning that wood style probably exists because Hashirama inherited a tiny amount of six paths power through Asura's soul.\n\nSince Asura wasn't a powerful or unique person prior to being entrusted with power from his father, his descendants didn't inherit anything from his bloodline, while the powerful Indra whom unlocked his sharingan on his own was able to pass it down through genes as a kekkei genkai. On the other hand, reincarnations have the same chakra as the original Indra and Asura, and so they by extension have access to the same abilities as their past lives. This also relates back to how Madara was able to unlock his rinnegan from combining both chakras to recreate Hagaromo's chakra.",

Since natural chakra improve user chakra including control, user with perfecr chakra control combine with natural chakra can do jutsus which other way wouldnt be possible. You could say natural chakra is a temporary vessel of second natural chakra of your choose. Hashirama mastery of natural chakra is in his own league, took few seconds to become in sage mode conpare to naruto few minutes. Anyway once cause body to memorise that and you have it.. a artificial bloodline. Maybe in Hashirama body might be resident  a little of natural chakra because of mastery, it could explain why many people died while attempting to implant hashirama cells, because contained tiny ammount of natural chakra and code of wood relase, so that natural chakra was gathering without control. (Well afterall there is reason why anbu burn bodies, to avoid secrets). It also could explain why no other senju and his children didnt have one because it wasnt actual bloodline. Ofc this is my explanation to using in fanfic, but kinda plausible ( i guess, idk dont kill me).",

If not lower because 90% of the episodes are bad. I\u2019m hyped for the future of the anime, but for now it\u2019s no where near the other heavy hitters currently going on like My Hero, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, Tower of God, etc. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that, but when the majority say it\u2019s cheeks, it\u2019s probably some cheeks",

It\u2019s nothing personal and he\u2019s the type of person to thank you for putting up a good fight against him. The only personal beef he had (and got over pretty quickly tbh) was Tobirama. He could\u2019ve killed him out of vengeance and pulled a Sasuke but he was like nah, I\u2019m doing my own thing and if i can kill him on the way, that\u2019d be great. He didn\u2019t really care for his clan either. Other than his brothers, the only person he cared about was his other brother Hashirama but that was over pretty quickly too. He\u2019s just someone who had a goal and he was going to achieve it. Nothing personal, all business. So talk no jutsu on someone like him would be pretty much useless unless it\u2019s from Hashirama but Hashirama gave up on him a long time ago because he realized how useless it was. Not to say that his brothers\u2019 deaths didn\u2019t practically shape his goal, for a world where everything is fakely perfect. He was a still a person with feelings after all. \n\nAlthough I\u2019ve got to say that Hashirama\u2019s and Madara\u2019s talk at the end was one of my favorite parts of the whole series. Actually, their whole story is one of my favorites.",

It parallels back to Asura and Indra, with Indra having unbelievable power but lacking in companionship while Asura had great companionship but lacked in power. In the case of the Senju vs Uchiha, I just assumed that the Senju were able to rival the Uchiha based on their great coordination skills and larger numbers, with Hashirama having access to unnatural powers due to him being a reincarnation of Asura, whom was entrusted with Six Paths power from his father. This relates back to wood style since it is probably based off of the divine tree, and six paths power originates from the divine tree, meaning that wood style probably exists because Hashirama inherited a tiny amount of six paths power through Asura's soul.\n\nSince Asura wasn't a powerful or unique person prior to being entrusted with power from his father, his descendants didn't inherit anything from his bloodline, while the powerful Indra whom unlocked his sharingan on his own was able to pass it down through genes as a kekkei genkai. On the other hand, reincarnations have the same chakra as the original Indra and Asura, and so they by extension have access to the same abilities as their past lives. This also relates back to how Madara was able to unlock his rinnegan from combining both chakras to recreate Hagaromo's chakra.",

Since natural chakra improve user chakra including control, user with perfecr chakra control combine with natural chakra can do jutsus which other way wouldnt be possible. You could say natural chakra is a temporary vessel of second natural chakra of your choose. Hashirama mastery of natural chakra is in his own league, took few seconds to become in sage mode conpare to naruto few minutes. Anyway once cause body to memorise that and you have it.. a artificial bloodline. Maybe in Hashirama body might be resident  a little of natural chakra because of mastery, it could explain why many people died while attempting to implant hashirama cells, because contained tiny ammount of natural chakra and code of wood relase, so that natural chakra was gathering without control. (Well afterall there is reason why anbu burn bodies, to avoid secrets). It also could explain why no other senju and his children didnt have one because it wasnt actual bloodline. Ofc this is my explanation to using in fanfic, but kinda plausible ( i guess, idk dont kill me).",

I love the series as a whole, and the manga is going off and the anime is picking up, but to say the anime is GOATed is a huge overstatement. Prolly like a 6 out of 10 overall. If not lower because 90% of the episodes are bad. I\u2019m hyped for the future of the anime, but for now it\u2019s no where near the other heavy hitters currently going on like My Hero, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, Tower of God, etc. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that, but when the majority say it\u2019s cheeks, it\u2019s probably some cheeks",

It\u2019s nothing personal and he\u2019s the type of person to thank you for putting up a good fight against him. The only personal beef he had (and got over pretty quickly tbh) was Tobirama. He could\u2019ve killed him out of vengeance and pulled a Sasuke but he was like nah, I\u2019m doing my own thing and if i can kill him on the way, that\u2019d be great. He didn\u2019t really care for his clan either. Other than his brothers, the only person he cared about was his other brother Hashirama but that was over pretty quickly too. He\u2019s just someone who had a goal and he was going to achieve it. Nothing personal, all business. So talk no jutsu on someone like him would be pretty much useless unless it\u2019s from Hashirama but Hashirama gave up on him a long time ago because he realized how useless it was. Not to say that his brothers\u2019 deaths didn\u2019t practically shape his goal, for a world where everything is fakely perfect. He was a still a person with feelings after all. \n\nAlthough I\u2019ve got to say that Hashirama\u2019s and Madara\u2019s talk at the end was one of my favorite parts of the whole series.

It parallels back to Asura and Indra, with Indra having unbelievable power but lacking in companionship while Asura had great companionship but lacked in power. In the case of the Senju vs Uchiha, I just assumed that the Senju were able to rival the Uchiha based on their great coordination skills and larger numbers, with Hashirama having access to unnatural powers due to him being a reincarnation of Asura, whom was entrusted with Six Paths power from his father. This relates back to wood style since it is probably based off of the divine tree, and six paths power originates from the divine tree, meaning that wood style probably exists because Hashirama inherited a tiny amount of six paths power through Asura's soul.\n\nSince Asura wasn't a powerful or unique person prior to being entrusted with power from his father, his descendants didn't inherit anything from his bloodline, while the powerful Indra whom unlocked his sharingan on his own was able to pass it down through genes as a kekkei genkai. On the other hand, reincarnations have the same chakra as the original Indra and Asura, and so they by extension have access to the same abilities as their past lives. This also relates back to how Madara was able to unlock his rinnegan from combining both chakras to recreate Hagaromo's chakra.",

Since natural chakra improve user chakra including control, user with perfecr chakra control combine with natural chakra can do jutsus which other way wouldnt be possible. You could say natural chakra is a temporary vessel of second natural chakra of your choose. Hashirama mastery of natural chakra is in his own league, took few seconds to become in sage mode conpare to naruto few minutes. Anyway once cause body to memorise that and you have it.. a artificial bloodline. Maybe in Hashirama body might be resident  a little of natural chakra because of mastery, it could explain why many people died while attempting to implant hashirama cells, because contained tiny ammount of natural chakra and code of wood relase, so that natural chakra was gathering without control. (Well afterall there is reason why anbu burn bodies, to avoid secrets). It also could explain why no other senju and his children didnt have one because it wasnt actual bloodline. Ofc this is my explanation to using in fanfic, but kinda plausible ( i guess, idk dont kill me).",

If not lower because 90% of the episodes are bad. I\u2019m hyped for the future of the anime, but for now it\u2019s no where near the other heavy hitters currently going on like My Hero, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, Tower of God, etc. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I respect that, but when the majority say it\u2019s cheeks, it\u2019s probably some cheeks",

It parallels back to Asura and Indra, with Indra having unbelievable power but lacking in companionship while Asura had great companionship but lacked in power. In the case of the Senju vs Uchiha, I just assumed that the Senju were able to rival the Uchiha based on their great coordination skills and larger numbers, with Hashirama having access to unnatural powers due to him being a reincarnation of Asura, whom was entrusted with Six Paths power from his father. This relates back to wood style since it is probably based off of the divine tree, and six paths power originates from the divine tree, meaning that wood style probably exists because Hashirama inherited a tiny amount of six paths power through Asura's soul.\n\nSince Asura wasn't a powerful or unique person prior to being entrusted with power from his father, his descendants didn't inherit anything from his bloodline, while the powerful Indra whom unlocked his sharingan on his own was able to pass it down through genes as a kekkei genkai. On the other hand, reincarnations have the same chakra as the original Indra and Asura, and so they by extension have access to the same abilities as their past lives. This also relates back to how Madara was able to unlock his rinnegan from combining both chakras to recreate Hagaromo's chakra.",
