    "body": "I like to thank Haha for voicing something in episode 600 that has been bothering me for awhile.  The trend in this subreddit and other fan boards is to want to turn Runningman into a \u2018wholesome\u2019 variety show.  Where they get to talk, hang out and banter, which allows the viewers to get to know and connect with the members.  This also seems to be JSJ\u2019s vision as he wants the members to work on \u2018challenges\u2019 like starting a business, with no more spies or missions.  There was a lot of support for part 1 of JSJ retirement episode and for the talk portion of Episode 600 in this subreddit.\n\nHowever, I like to voice support for the other side and that I love the competitive part of Runningman.  I was totally on board with KJK, Haha and Sechan in JSJ\u2019s retirement episode where they felt it\u2019s boring for them to film an episode of them just hanging out.  For me, I want to see them put their wits against each other and see who comes up on top.  I want to see them figure out loop holes and out smart the production team, to win against difficult odds, in difficult environments, to see them throw their bodies into mud flats in order to seize the victory.  Thank you YJS for repeating again - that they can play physical games.  Yes, they may have hurt themselves in the past but now they know how to take care of their bodies better.  JSM broke her foot walking around her house but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s now too old to walk around.\n\nBopil PD if you are reading this, there is a lot of fan support for JSJ\u2019s vision of Runningman.  That may be true for some, but I want to let you know there are also those who yearn for the old competitive runningman.  It\u2019s no longer classified as an \u2018urban action variety show\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t have to further devolve into one of the many \u2018observation variety show\u2019 as YJS puts it in Episode 598.  Let\u2019s get to episode 1000 and let\u2019s do it in such a way that the episodes are memorable, and epic.",

            "body": "Agreed. Just because they're getting old, doesn't mean they can't play games anymore. Like your title says Running Man is a 'game variety show'. That doesn't only include games where they have to get physical. I love it when they play psychological games and I'm not talking about quizzes. They can still move around the city in their cars doing missions and stuffs without running tho (when the pandemic is over pls stay safe). They don't have to play mud games or tug of war or name tag elimination for it to be fun. Give them individual or team missions where they uncover some secret or decipher a code or where they have to backstab each other. That's what I loved about the show more than the physicality.",

Doing unique things like cooking challenges, code decoding, betrayals, and moving through unique locations across Korea are what made the show what it was and I want to see RM get back to that (Also, I doubt COVID would be much of an issue if they plan locations, as Sixth Sense moves around a lot as well).",

Same as doing competitive games every episode, although this one is usually harder to get bored of. I think fans say they want the 'wholesome' episode because the bond the members has now looks stronger than ever, especially since they have gone through a lot together.\n\nso to summarise, yeah Running Man should do exciting missions. However, they should also do something like part 1 of JSJ retirement ep once in a while.",

In my opinion, Chulmin PD had a more structured approach, which made the cast sort of have to stick to their characters more, while Bopil PD's more loose approach is allowing them to somewhat show more of their true selves and have more real (not character driven) interactions. But I do think Bopil PD's team needs to work more on the games side, especially on making the themes and games more coherent. Though another problem seems to be that it's hard for the members to play competitively as they've already played so many games in the past that winning or losing probably doesn't really matter.",

There\u2019s plenty of \u201changing out\u201d variety shows.\nAnd I don\u2019t have fond memories of the final events in episodes 29-31 where they all had to work together to complete a task so everyone won or everyone lost at the end.  I loved how they split up into teams in every episode and how the splitting would seem deliberate or arbitrary at times, but often worked to give us beloved team-ups or interesting new combinations, and so last week\u2019s opponent could easily be this week\u2019s teammate and vice versa.",

I feel like the show runners really picked up the fact that the sitting-and-talking version gets a lot of positive comments these days, but for me personally, the excitement feels lacking. I think even the laughter is easier to bring about with more action. I miss the scheming, betraying, and whining over difficult circumstances vibe. I know there's a lot of praise for the early RM version of action, but I also think Chul Min PD also succeeded in throwing them in situations that really brought out the competitiveness as well as the laughter. Talking Man is fun for maybe two episodes a year (for example I totally understand why it suited ep 600 - that was a milestone to sit and talk about), but doing a variation of that everyday is questionable. They could at least combine both approaches.",

I just watch old episodes as a way to cope these days, and while it's not the whole cast, Outrun has had some Classic Running Man moments so I've been veering more towards it and another show to get my weekly laughs.",

(an example is KJK talking about YJS payment before he was popular, which we've heard about ten times already. lol).   \nIf they went the talking route we would likely see them repeating the same thing every 2-4 months which would get boring fast. \n\nWhereas I would like to see more nametag (next episode looks like it has one) and physical challenges it is understandable why they can't do them every week but no reason why they can't do spy, mafia, 'race/first to finish' challenges (like some older episodes and the one they did in OutRun where they had to get food) etc, etc (they have tons of games they could revisit).\n\nThe way I saw the last few episodes was it seems more like JSJ wants to be on a less demanding show, and even his letter at the end was sombre but it felt it was more him talking rather than the views of the rest of the members. (maybe JSJ is thinking of leaving which would be a shame but if he can't do it anymore and/or he wants more free time then all good and can respect his decision either way)",

            "body": "I agree. Bopil PD does really great in bringing out/ allowing the natural chemistry of the cast to shine through, which is why I think the 'wholesome' episodes work. In my opinion, Chulmin PD had a more structured approach, which made the cast sort of have to stick to their characters more, while Bopil PD's more loose approach is allowing them to somewhat show more of their true selves and have more real (not character driven) interactions. But I do think Bopil PD's team needs to work more on the games side, especially on making the themes and games more coherent. Though another problem seems to be that it's hard for the members to play competitively as they've already played so many games in the past that winning or losing probably doesn't really matter.",

They're popular with the GP. Running Man nearly got canceled many times in the past because the original style didn't appeal domestically while it was wildly appealing with international audiences, and international audiences weren't bringing in the money back then. \n\nPersonally, I fully agree with you that the recent episodes have been some of the most boring in the history of the show, but as long as they get good domestic ratings and feedback, this is likely the style of show we'll keep seeing.  I just watch old episodes as a way to cope these days, and while it's not the whole cast, Outrun has had some Classic Running Man moments so I've been veering more towards it and another show to get my weekly laughs.",
