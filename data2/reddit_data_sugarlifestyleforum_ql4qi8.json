    "body": "I get SO MANY messages from these very young guys! There are ALOT in South FL between 18 and 29 always messaging me. At the beginning I would entertain conversation because I'm also young and of course who wouldnt love another hot young body on top of them as opposed to a traditional SD type (middle aged,over weight, etc) but in reality they are all tools! The majority expect a \"free trial\" or when I tell them what I want for an allowance they hit me with these gems of a comeback \"I'm not one of these  old guys\" blah blah I should get a discount becauseI'm sure I'm younger and hotter than what you typically find here\". \"You should be happy it's me instead of a grandpa\" etc. \ud83d\ude44 excuse my French but I don't give a flying fuck about any of that otherwiseI would be on a traditional dating site or tinder if I wanted a dead end hookup. Boy you are on seeking.com meaning you gotta pay to play. No discounts! This ain't Walmart. So now when a young guy messages me I just ask them \"why are you not on hinge or Bumble? I'm asking you because this is a sugar dating site for the purpose of financing a luxury lifestyle and most you of you young guys feel entitled and either low ball an allowance or feel you shouldnt have to give an allowance at all and I should be happy with dinner and a movie\" Usually they ghost away \ud83d\ude1d my point is why tf isn't there an age restriction for SDs because it's very common and I'm surprised I have never seen this addressed before on reddit.",

I\u2019m sure many are lovely. I have a brother that\u2019s 30 and he\u2019s a wonderful human. His girlfriend is a very lucky lady. I just don\u2019t find them as intellectually stimulating, which is important to me, and they don\u2019t have the great life stories that I love, the maturity, the class\u2026. I\u2019m pretty worldly myself, as well as an old soul, so I like to meet men that can teach me things I didn\u2019t know and have been to places I\u2019ve never been, have fascinating stories of decades past, have an ear for old music, decades of sexual experience etc etc \u2026. I like art galleries, museums and the theater\u2026 I LOVE Old Hollywood movies and musicals\u2026 I idol is Marilyn not some Kardashian\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be interested in music festivals, camping trips, social media stuff etc  It\u2019s not a dig at young guys being generally  \u201cnot good\u201d in any way, or even cheap or anything. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be great matches for someone. It\u2019s just a personal preference. Even when I was young I was always attracted to older men. I just feel like they have so much more to offer, and I\u2019m not just talking about finances.",

Less focused on immediate penetration or the good ol\u2019 \u201cJack hammer technique\u201d that nobody ever asked for lol More romantic. Practice makes perfect\u2026 Same way he may be the best you\u2019ve ever had for now, but someone could come along and completely reset the bar for you at your age. Again, not all, obviously. Just my personal experience and personal preference. I hope you and your SD also have amazing sex though!!! I\u2019m not trying to judge, just my personal experiences. I thought I was great in bed when I was 22. And I was. But nothing compared to how I am now. Lol",

HOWEVER, not all are like that. I think I got on there when I was 28ish. Why? I had a lot of money saved up, was very depressed with my life and my dead end marriage (married young), felt like a middle aged man (had already worked for the same organization and started climbing the career ladder since I was 16. I was a lot fatter, a lot more depressed, had some money, no debt etc... So I joined SA and found my first SGF, and haven't really looked back (did find a regular GF right before corona started, did find her on SA, it is vanilla but do help here and there and do treat her well). BUT I never put down other SDs, I never tried shaming the women I talked to etc... I mean while I was / am an attractive dude, being morbidly obese and married, it kind of I guess made sense why I was on there. Never had issues meeting women from there.\n\nSo yes, while many guys may fit the douche bill / fake SDs like you say, not all of us do / did. So do realize that. If you do have your hard age limits, that's cool too. But I know if I got a message like the one you sent, I would have blocked you too... even though I, and many others (but not most) like me are legit. Starting off negatively ranting about others is a horrible idea. \n\nGood luck and happy hunting!",

That's also something too. If they are hot, young and single and on that site and say they are legit... that would make you wonder what their personality defect is. Because I have a great personality, and know if at my thinnest in 2019, if I were single I would not need SA. Hell even though I was married I still did very well... found a GF there (similar home life to me though). So a hot young rich single guy that needs to be an SD... there is likely something off.",

The real SDs are not always gonna be available. They will have great arrangements ongoing and will only be actively seeking when those arrangements are ending. Ladies need to move fast. You don\u2019t know how many ladies missed out by waiting a few weeks and I already snatched up another woman who was ready to go.

They are like slime molds spreading through the forest looking for the shortest, cheapest, most efficient path to the next nutrient. In this case the nutrient is sex.\n\nIt makes 100% zero sense to let them trigger you. They know why you're there. There's no mystery about what sugar dating is to them.\n\nThey are just testing you to see what they can get away with and then they laugh about it one way or the other. They do this for the same reason they talk shit on streaming video games, are obnoxious to teachers, and cause trouble in school because they can and they know it'll lead to a reaction. In this case, an outcome that's either great for them (free sex) or at least a  fun one (a SB who freaks out).\n\nI'm not saying it's right, but young people are born every day and part of their own growth is to test boundaries and learn which ones are going to far.\n\nDon't waste your own time dealing with them but it's not SAs responsibility to police adults based on age as for every few that are full of shit, there are a few real ones.

The problem you get here is a women will post about 1-2 bad experiences, and then state \"no one should ever date an SD under 40\".\n\nAnd - admittedly, reddit is going to skew younger - you have plenty of legitimate SDs (in their 30s) that are going to point out that... because of 1-2 bad experiences, you shouldn't be generalizing that much.\n\n> Look at what industry they claim to work in and do some research on median incomes for that age range. Everyone wants to think they\u2019re the exception, but you can\u2019t have all 30 year old men be the highest earners.\n\nIn my view here, sugaring in 30-40s is all about your life situation.  \n\nIf you are single, with a moderate life style, no debt, making 150-250/year, living outside of LA/SF/NYC, you can probably swing 2-4k/month for sugaring.  (Rule Clarity:  I'm not stating allowance amounts, but overall spending budget - which should be allowed in the rules.  )\n\nOTOH, if you are married, with 2 kids, making the top of that range (250k) - I feel like it would be a struggle to even have a 2k/monthly budget consistently, unless you are tapping into other money.",

Young guys should be out there in the vanilla world, getting experience, and learning how to interact with women without using their money as a crutch. \n\nAt the very least I tell young guys to date older women while they focus on their careers.  Older women can teach young guys a lot about how to behave around women, have more patience than younger girls, not to mention being able to teach you a few tricks in bed.  \n\nThen when a guy is in his 40s, has his money together, and some experience he can flip the script and start being a sugar daddy to some younger girls.",

As you could instead ask why are you on here if you\u2019re so young etc. As you\u2019re starting the entire interaction off based on an assumption may or may not be true, and besides my age you have barely any information about me individually to make that uneducated assumption about me. Especially as I typically will take the time to read someone\u2019s profile and tailor my message to them specifically. \n\n\nThe only two times I\u2019ll ever play that card if the pot Sb I\u2019m talking to makes it evidently clear the only thing she is offering is her fun box or a dynamic that\u2019s only physical if I\u2019m extremely attracted to her. As in my mind if that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to be offering the relationship isn\u2019t as valuable to me as one that is open to or willing to be more than a hook up buddy. As in that scenario it makes no difference to me if she says yes or no to it. Yes ultimately I could simply say we\u2019re not a good fit thanks and move on, which I have done in countless scenarios. However it\u2019s more of a this only part of what is ideal for me so I\u2019m not willing to do that amount kind of thing then the young card, but I do mention to her what your offering isn\u2019t really the ideal arrangement type for me and because of that I\u2019d be okay with  stated amount instead of her ppm stated amount.  \n\nThe other time I\u2019ll do that is if I get sent an insane amount with little to no conversation and after asking follow up questions behind that amount, and the answer I get is something along the lines of because my time is valuable. \n\nNot all of us are bad, but it sounds like you\u2019re more on the transnational side of things with some of the comments in your post. The dude either wants it for free or he knows what is expected of him so why not treat him with the same respect you would someone significantly his senior? Give your expectations and if he can\u2019t do them and ask you that block and move on.",

Practice makes perfect\u2026 Same way he may be the best you\u2019ve ever had for now, but someone could come along and completely reset the bar for you at your age. Again, not all, obviously. Just my personal experience and personal preference. I hope you and your SD also have amazing sex though!!! I\u2019m not trying to judge, just my personal experiences. I thought I was great in bed when I was 22. And I was. But nothing compared to how I am now. Lol",

The problem you get here is a women will post about 1-2 bad experiences, and then state \"no one should ever date an SD under 40\".\n\nAnd - admittedly, reddit is going to skew younger - you have plenty of legitimate SDs (in their 30s) that are going to point out that... because of 1-2 bad experiences, you shouldn't be generalizing that much.\n\n> Look at what industry they claim to work in and do some research on median incomes for that age range. Everyone wants to think they\u2019re the exception, but you can\u2019t have all 30 year old men be the highest earners.\n\nIn my view here, sugaring in 30-40s is all about your life situation.  \n\nIf you are single, with a moderate life style, no debt, making 150-250/year, living outside of LA/SF/NYC, you can probably swing 2-4k/month for sugaring.  (Rule Clarity:  I'm not stating allowance amounts, but overall spending budget - which should be allowed in the rules.  )\n\nOTOH, if you are married, with 2 kids, making the top of that range (250k) - I feel like it would be a struggle to even have a 2k/monthly budget consistently, unless you are tapping into other money.",

I just don\u2019t find them as intellectually stimulating, which is important to me, and they don\u2019t have the great life stories that I love, the maturity, the class\u2026. I\u2019m pretty worldly myself, as well as an old soul, so I like to meet men that can teach me things I didn\u2019t know and have been to places I\u2019ve never been, have fascinating stories of decades past, have an ear for old music, decades of sexual experience etc etc \u2026. I like art galleries, museums and the theater\u2026 I LOVE Old Hollywood movies and musicals\u2026 I idol is Marilyn not some Kardashian\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be interested in music festivals, camping trips, social media stuff etc  It\u2019s not a dig at young guys being generally  \u201cnot good\u201d in any way, or even cheap or anything. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be great matches for someone. It\u2019s just a personal preference. Even when I was young I was always attracted to older men. I just feel like they have so much more to offer, and I\u2019m not just talking about finances.",

I actually am attractive (more so now that I lost a ton of that weight two years ago, albeit put some back on thanks to the rona isolation, but am still net loss of 75ish pounds), BUT yes, totally hot six packed guys potentially be weary of. That's also something too. If they are hot, young and single and on that site and say they are legit... that would make you wonder what their personality defect is. Because I have a great personality, and know if at my thinnest in 2019, if I were single I would not need SA. Hell even though I was married I still did very well... found a GF there (similar home life to me though). So a hot young rich single guy that needs to be an SD... there is likely something off.",
