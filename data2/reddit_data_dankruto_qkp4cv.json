So anyone complaining about Obito being a victim of TnJ wasn't paying attention.\n\nMy problem with the scene is that it feels kind of rushed and it doesn't have the impact behind it that the TnJ with Nagato had. But I get why Obito changed because it's very clear that Obito subconsciously wanted someone to tell him how wrong he was because he was in so deep into the Eye of the Moon Plan that he couldn't admit to himself that he was wrong. That's why Naruto breaks him so quickly.",

This is someone who considers himself no one and desperately wants to be no one because he knows that if he gets reminded that he's Obito he would have to reconcile who Obito was to who Tobi is. And that's why he is so desperate not to let the mask come off. And once the mask comes off be resolves to prove he's right by breaking Naruto's spirit because then he could assure himself that this is congruent with who he was in the past. The problem is Naruto doesn't fold and that starts to create doubt in Obito's heart because it's becoming clear he goofed. But even after talking to Naruto Obito isn't convinced. So he talks to Kakashi and asks Kakashi what would happen if Naruto felt a pain like his and Kakashi responded that he would be there to ensure Naruto didn't end up like Obito did. And then later Obito talks to Madara asking him who he was only for Madara to shut off any notion if self-identity for Obito and that's when Obito finally makes the decision to embrace his identity.\n\nBeautiful on paper but the execution was lacking.",

But I get why Obito changed because it's very clear that Obito subconsciously wanted someone to tell him how wrong he was because he was in so deep into the Eye of the Moon Plan that he couldn't admit to himself that he was wrong.

He was only doing this because he believed there was NO other alternative to live a happy life, but then he says he\u2019s just doing it because it\u2019s easier? Not only does that make no sense consistency wise but it\u2019s just plain stupid. Obito has had EVERYTHING go wrong for him and barely made it to that point, it was not the easy path by a long shot",

This is someone who considers himself no one and desperately wants to be no one because he knows that if he gets reminded that he's Obito he would have to reconcile who Obito was to who Tobi is. And that's why he is so desperate not to let the mask come off. And once the mask comes off be resolves to prove he's right by breaking Naruto's spirit because then he could assure himself that this is congruent with who he was in the past. The problem is Naruto doesn't fold and that starts to create doubt in Obito's heart because it's becoming clear he goofed. But even after talking to Naruto Obito isn't convinced. So he talks to Kakashi and asks Kakashi what would happen if Naruto felt a pain like his and Kakashi responded that he would be there to ensure Naruto didn't end up like Obito did. And then later Obito talks to Madara asking him who he was only for Madara to shut off any notion if self-identity for Obito and that's when Obito finally makes the decision to embrace his identity.\n\nBeautiful on paper but the execution was lacking.",

Obito wasn't some abnormality of the Shinobi World, he was another product of it, continuing cycles of violence and hatred like Orochimaru, Zabuza, Itachi, Madara, Danzo, and others.

So anyone complaining about Obito being a victim of TnJ wasn't paying attention.\n\nMy problem with the scene is that it feels kind of rushed and it doesn't have the impact behind it that the TnJ with Nagato had. But I get why Obito changed because it's very clear that Obito subconsciously wanted someone to tell him how wrong he was because he was in so deep into the Eye of the Moon Plan that he couldn't admit to himself that he was wrong. That's why Naruto breaks him so quickly.",

This is someone who considers himself no one and desperately wants to be no one because he knows that if he gets reminded that he's Obito he would have to reconcile who Obito was to who Tobi is. And that's why he is so desperate not to let the mask come off. And once the mask comes off be resolves to prove he's right by breaking Naruto's spirit because then he could assure himself that this is congruent with who he was in the past. The problem is Naruto doesn't fold and that starts to create doubt in Obito's heart because it's becoming clear he goofed. But even after talking to Naruto Obito isn't convinced. So he talks to Kakashi and asks Kakashi what would happen if Naruto felt a pain like his and Kakashi responded that he would be there to ensure Naruto didn't end up like Obito did. And then later Obito talks to Madara asking him who he was only for Madara to shut off any notion if self-identity for Obito and that's when Obito finally makes the decision to embrace his identity.\n\nBeautiful on paper but the execution was lacking.",

And once the mask comes off be resolves to prove he's right by breaking Naruto's spirit because then he could assure himself that this is congruent with who he was in the past. The problem is Naruto doesn't fold and that starts to create doubt in Obito's heart because it's becoming clear he goofed. But even after talking to Naruto Obito isn't convinced. So he talks to Kakashi and asks Kakashi what would happen if Naruto felt a pain like his and Kakashi responded that he would be there to ensure Naruto didn't end up like Obito did. And then later Obito talks to Madara asking him who he was only for Madara to shut off any notion if self-identity for Obito and that's when Obito finally makes the decision to embrace his identity.\n\nBeautiful on paper but the execution was lacking.",

He never tried to campaign to the world that Obito was a good person all along, he was refuting Black Zetsu, who was rubbing it in that Obito was a tool for him to bring back Kaguya. The regular shinobi world prior to Naruto used child soldiers to uphold the status quo of the Feudal Lords. Obito wasn't some abnormality of the Shinobi World, he was another product of it, continuing cycles of violence and hatred like Orochimaru, Zabuza, Itachi, Madara, Danzo, and others. Would it matter to a grunt in Konoha that Nagato's nation was used as the battlefield for most Great Ninja Worlds? No, they would just see the man who murdered the village with an Almighty Push.",
