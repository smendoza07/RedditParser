    "body": "Luckily she doesn\u2019t have to move, which I sort of knew since she only applied to a few schools and all in the area where we both live. I\u2019m funding it (hope she gets some financial aid, but if she doesn\u2019t, whatever). I\u2019m so happy for her. It will add some pressure to her life and she\u2019ll have somewhat less free time, but we\u2019ll figure it out. With the right partner these relationships can be so fulfilling (and I\u2019m talking about what I get out of it)!",

I remember a similar feeling of pride when my SGF got into the top university in a country she always dreamed of moving to. Unfortunately, it was across the ocean and meant the end of our SR, but she's doing amazing and sometimes if you love someone you have to let them go for their own good. In this case, you have the best of both worlds!",
