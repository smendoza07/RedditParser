    "body": "I had a M&G yesterday with a POT SD that went incredibly well. Super attractive, fit and healthy, great sense of humor, dresses well. I sent him a text that night and let him know how much I enjoyed our meet and that I'd love to move forward with an arrangement if he felt the same. Obviously given the title of this post he said yes and he would let me know when he was available to schedule something with me. \n\nThings worked out that we were able to meet up today. He remembered I mentioned my \"weakness\" for a good cheese and literally showed up with 7 different kinds of goat cheese, crackers, and wine. The entire encounter felt so natural and easy. There was no awkwardness, no shyness, it was almost like we'd known each other forever. He was so respectful, constantly doing gentle checkins to ensure he wasn't crossing boundaries. And the intimacy was next level. He's a body worshipper. Every inch of me was touched, every part of me appreciated. Oh my God. I mean... my whole body was shaking from the oxytocin overdose \ud83d\ude02 that's not something that happens for me! And I didn't even have to ASK he use protection, he came equipped. Between the conversation, laughter, and intimacy tonight, this experience has completely blown me away. \n\nI honestly didn't expect to find something this quickly, especially with someone where we have so much natural chemistry. I'm just \ud83d\ude0d and hoping this is a long term thing and not a pump and dump. If it was half as good for him as it was for me, I'm pretty sure he'd see me again.",
