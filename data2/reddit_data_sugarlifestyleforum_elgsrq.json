    "body": "I am in shock at what I've been reading on this forum. I came here to ask some SD's opinion about something but I have to make this post first!   \n\n\nDo you girls know the difference between prostitution and sugar dating? I'm going to explain it to those that need a refresher.   \n\n\nA prostitute is someone who exchanges sexual acts for money without taking much else into consideration. The chemistry, whether or not they will regret it, whether or not they will enjoy it and ultimately whether or not they even trust them - these are not a factor in the equation. \n\nA sugar baby, on the other hand, is someone who DOES factor those things into the equation. A sugarship is one that is mutually enjoyed by both people. SB enjoys her SD's company, trusts him, actually feels pleasure when intimate, & most importantly respects him. and vice versa.   \n\n\nSo when you meet a potential SD, please remind them that you are not a prostitute so they should  NOT be putting a time limit on intimacy. Reassure them that you understand your role, but intimacy requires a level of trust that is only achieved after getting to know one another. Of course, discretion is a big thing with most SD's so you don't need to know their entire life. You just need to know enough about them so that you genuinely trust them. Also remind them that without reaching trust first, you wouldn't even be able to actually enjoy the intimacy. In the back of your mind, all you could think about was how awkward it is for you and how scared you are that he could hurt you at any moment. SD's WANT you to enjoy yourself, they want you to trust them and vice versa. If they try to tell you anything that makes you rush your process on trust then move on.  \n\n\nAt the end of the day you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and RESPECT yourself so if you are okay with being intimate with someone before you trust them then that's ok! but you are an SB for a reason so you probably aren't okay with that. The SD's are an SD for a reason too, they want something more than what a prostitute can give them. Of course, they won't say no to intimacy on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd date but a true SD WILL understand and RESPECT that you aren't just giving it up to anyone with enough $ in their hand. Please take this into consideration with every single potential SD from here on out ladies and if you have questions lmk. I've been a SB for 12 years, you can trust my advice!",

A person could be a prostitute and an escort and an SB and a wife. How do you know which role she is playing for you at the moment? By the question you ask:\n\nProstitute: \"How much for a blow job?\"\n\nEscort: \"How much for an hour of your time?\"\n\nSB: \"How much for a date?\"\n\nSGF: \"How much is your rent?\"\n\nWife: \"How much can I spend?

There are girls who post nudes on gone wild, or people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\". They're doing something they enjoy and getting paid for it. They probably refer to it as a side hustle AND hobby. They don't have to fit in two different circles and I think that's a majority of the issue people have when they hear someone else on SLF call sugaring sex work.

There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

Why are you insisting how I *feel* is not so?\n\n> That's just wrong. Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\ndon't be obtuse. I was very clearly referring to couples who only post porn of themselves and happen to make a profit from them. I doubt they call themselves sex workers, I doubt they call themselves porn stars--but the fact remains that income was made from sex work. You feeling otherwise doesn't change the facts.",

Who said anything about charity? \n\nEither way. \u201cSR\u201d or \u201cvanilla\u201d I\u2019m spending thousands of dollars a month either way heh. So as far as I\u2019m concerned there\u2019s very little difference, the way things have typically played out for me. \n\nAlso, if a woman is with me, you best believe I\u2019m making damn sure that her primary motivation to be with me isn\u2019t money related. Stability/money and all that is part of it sure but if it\u2019s a primary rather than secondary motivator she can take a walk.\n\nThat\u2019s just worked for me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f No complaints so far.

If you saw a comment that said \"I hope you get raped\" any mod would remove it and likely ban the user. And for the most part, permabans aren't immediately handed out which prevents us from looking like another sub that is just an echo chamber. All of our mods are adults with full time jobs and (presumably) their own SRs and the rules are set up so that one group (the supposed \"actually escorts\") isn't drowning out the other group(s) (\"Relationship SDs\", Experience daddies, platonics, etc.) One of our mods lives in Aus, which, given the current standings, means she might not be tied to her phone to check modmail every hour and that's super understandable. Especially since a majority of what they remove is probably Rule 2. Being a mod of a different subreddit and also admin/modding non-reddit commuities (discord) I get it. I think a majority of the rules and enforcements are done without a clear bias. I have seen way worse subreddits (strugglefucking and makeupaddiction are pretty bad.)\n\nIt's really just the \"no escort/john\" rule, which has had several edits and clarifications, and several threads have stayed and several have been banned without any real consistency. It's a difficult rule to moderate, and since clearly the sugar bowl is not static (we gain new terms, we lose terms, overall expectations shift with society) it is very difficult to make a long-standing rule addressing \\*all\\* of the issues without overtuning it or making it too general. Although, if you have a suggestion on it that doesn't skew one way or the other, I'm sure the mod team would love to hear about it.",

We need clear definitions of the  rules of this subreddit in order for it to be moderated properly. The  fact that the escort/john rule is not clear is part of the problem.     \n\n\nI agree and that's what I was trying to say. The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other. It is a difficult rule to shape without showing a clear and obvious bias towards any particular group, while still addressing the obvious/primary issue of using \"escort\" or \"cheap\" as insults.   \n\n\n\\>  enforce it every time. Not just when it suits you.\n\nI don't know how our mods work, but in any other community I've ever modded in, if there wasn't an automated mod log whenever an action was taken (facebook didn't have one for a long ass time), unless something was particularly egregious it's not even discussed why it's removed. I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason. But I'm not a mod and the mods typically don't discuss their reasoning outside of their quarterly community updates. I could be wrong about their structure.",

That if you sleep with someone you don't trust you aren't an SB? I'm missing it but given the previous language, what is it that you want people to imply?\n\nOverall you're implying escorts and prostitutes don't respect themselves, and SB's do and that's the difference between \"us\" and \"them\". You're also seriously undermining the amount of work that escorts and prostitutes have to do for screening for their *safety*. Not only do they have to trust them to be physical with them, they have to trust them not to be cops, or not to be salty over the service and refer cops to them. Of course they're going to be a bit more sketched out and a little more conservative with their overall trust. The fact that you are actively trying to make this a negative when it's warranted is disturbing.",

I was very disapointed in what i found. The majority of escorts , at least the ones that posted, were just straight up sex workers. Most high volume, some low volume. The entire mentality is to extract as much money as possible in the least amount of time. One of the most important rules was to not form any real emotional attachments to the clients. Does it happen? Of course, escorts are human too, but its strongly not advised there. I found that escorting is seen as a job, with an hourly rate. You will pay me xxx amount for an hour of my time. You want an overnight? Youll pay thousands to have me that long. I would read tactics on how to zone out during intimacy, even comments on \"why do clients hold my hand during sex, why they look at me while giving a bj, i dont allow you to go diwn on me\" i got the feeling that many of these sex workers do not enjoy being with their clients, and without a doubt are master manipulators, clock watching and ready to get out of there asap. the truth is, escorts make a lot of money. And with these strict rules in place they will make much much more than your average sb. Once you get that taste of the money being a pro, its almost impossible to be a regular sb. Now, im not looking down on escorts or sex workers  at all, i think they have every right to operate how they wish, but its just not my cup of tea, and they certainly arent sbs.",

High volume low dollar amount vs low volume high dollar amount really seems to be the difference in outlook towards clients from the general escort populous. But then I'm not an escort and have no idea what they go through. Just saying the way they're talking on Reddit looks much better than all is this \"desperation leading to emotional burnout\" that all of our salts love to use as talking points. You've long since deleted the post but less than 6 months ago wrote word for word \"I don't even bother with a hotel she's only going to be there for an hour\" and this was while you were escort shaming and distancing same as OP.

My post was simply meant to say the feeling i got on the sex worker subs that little emphasis was put on connection or chemistry, its really only about the money, and sure many have boundaries, but thats not what i witnessed on the sub. Constant complaints about their clients, more emphasis is put on getting the money , its their full time job. Im not shaming anybody, my only argument is that escorts are not permitted on SA and this sub is not for escorts either.

Because of obsoletion/streamlining, shifting landscape, technology, etc. When you\u2019re gone for such a long time, some things may change\u2014yearly for example\u2014as SA has! \n\nIf I worked at a hedge fund (SR) in 2017, and stopped working there\u2014didn\u2019t even make a move laterally to a bulge-bracket bank (vanilla dating), but instead got a job working at a hotel as concierge, then I\u2019d be an EX-Portfolio Manager!

Absolutely none of them turned into a sugar relationship. The ones that turned into sugar relationships were ones where the SD was, right out of the gate, paying for my time.

All my SRs but one happened when the SD showed an upfront investment and that he was serious about being there for me. Contrary to the opinion largely favored by men on this forum, the getting-to-know period should not be free- I believe a true SD would genuinely WANT to give a POT money to put her at ease and also show that he cares about her, that he wants a relationship- not just a quick hookup where sex is exchanged for money, and understands what this relationship is about. If he is a true SD and has the means, it's pocket change to him but shows a real commitment on his behalf to the girl. The man is the more powerful partner in this relationship and should behave as such by establishing trust from the offset- it's made out to be such a big deal that the M&G *must* be unpaid on this forum... but it's really not misaligned incentives to pay for one platonic date- it's a display of seriousness and integrity that will make any true SB respond in kind.",

If a man decides on a whim that he no longer wants to see a girl, that is a huge opportunity cost for the woman- who set that time aside when she could have seen someone else or worked longer hours or spent time with her kids, has to spend hours looking presentable, driving all the way there, allocating time for the date, etc. Men who are unreliable and insist on PPM with no regard for the woman's welfare are treating her like a call-girl- that is not an SD and is an abuse of power.",

Yes, Sugar is sex work on a very broad spectrum. But a guy who wants to engage a girl for sex for the least time and money with no input from her how the sex is going to go is a john all the way at the bottom of the spectrum. Some guy recently can't afford a hotel room to have sex with a \"SB\" and would be a john. A girl who charges by the hour to meet is also a pro. Everybody else who are not those things are on the spectrum all the way up to a pure relationship at the top. \n\nIMO, I prefer that the pure johns and escorts go somewhere else for their partners. But alas it will never be since they are already here and thriving apparently. It is up to each participant to screen out the Pros and not fall for the tricks of the trade.",

There are girls who post nudes on gone wild, or people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\". They're doing something they enjoy and getting paid for it. They probably refer to it as a side hustle AND hobby.

You seem to be assuming that people who admit it's sex work think of it as a job and that's all they think of it as.\n\nAbsolutely nailed it. There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

Why are you insisting how I *feel* is not so?\n\n> That's just wrong. Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\ndon't be obtuse. I was very clearly referring to couples who only post porn of themselves and happen to make a profit from them. I doubt they call themselves sex workers, I doubt they call themselves porn stars--but the fact remains that income was made from sex work. You feeling otherwise doesn't change the facts.",

If you saw a comment that said \"I hope you get raped\" any mod would remove it and likely ban the user. And for the most part, permabans aren't immediately handed out which prevents us from looking like another sub that is just an echo chamber. All of our mods are adults with full time jobs and (presumably) their own SRs and the rules are set up so that one group (the supposed \"actually escorts\") isn't drowning out the other group(s) (\"Relationship SDs\", Experience daddies, platonics, etc.) One of our mods lives in Aus, which, given the current standings, means she might not be tied to her phone to check modmail every hour and that's super understandable. Especially since a majority of what they remove is probably Rule 2. Being a mod of a different subreddit and also admin/modding non-reddit commuities (discord) I get it. I think a majority of the rules and enforcements are done without a clear bias. I have seen way worse subreddits (strugglefucking and makeupaddiction are pretty bad.)\n\nIt's really just the \"no escort/john\" rule, which has had several edits and clarifications, and several threads have stayed and several have been banned without any real consistency. It's a difficult rule to moderate, and since clearly the sugar bowl is not static (we gain new terms, we lose terms, overall expectations shift with society) it is very difficult to make a long-standing rule addressing \\*all\\* of the issues without overtuning it or making it too general. Although, if you have a suggestion on it that doesn't skew one way or the other, I'm sure the mod team would love to hear about it.",

We need clear definitions of the  rules of this subreddit in order for it to be moderated properly. The  fact that the escort/john rule is not clear is part of the problem.     \n\n\nI agree and that's what I was trying to say. The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other. It is a difficult rule to shape without showing a clear and obvious bias towards any particular group, while still addressing the obvious/primary issue of using \"escort\" or \"cheap\" as insults.   \n\n\n\\>  enforce it every time. Not just when it suits you.\n\nI don't know how our mods work, but in any other community I've ever modded in, if there wasn't an automated mod log whenever an action was taken (facebook didn't have one for a long ass time), unless something was particularly egregious it's not even discussed why it's removed. I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason. But I'm not a mod and the mods typically don't discuss their reasoning outside of their quarterly community updates. I could be wrong about their structure.",

The chemistry, whether or not they  will regret it, whether or not they will enjoy it and ultimately whether  or not they even trust them - these are not a factor in the equation.\n\nImplying prostitutes and escorts don't have any standards?\n\n>  SB enjoys her SD's company, trusts him, actually feels pleasure when intimate, & most importantly respects him.\n\nImplying prostitutes and escorts don't respect their clients? Implying they can't trust clients? Implying they don't/can't enjoy their clients companionship?\n\n> The SD's are an SD for a reason too, they want something more than what a prostitute can give them.\n\nImplying that there is some sort of mystical force field of physics at work that prevent prostitutes and/or escorts from transitioning to being a certain guy's sugar baby. Almost like they aren't good enough, you know, because you've demonized them.\n\n>  if you are okay with being intimate with someone before you trust them  then that's ok! but you are an SB for a reason so you probably aren't  okay with that\n\nWhat...is the implied reason here? That if you sleep with someone you don't trust you aren't an SB? I'm missing it but given the previous language, what is it that you want people to imply?\n\nOverall you're implying escorts and prostitutes don't respect themselves, and SB's do and that's the difference between \"us\" and \"them\". You're also seriously undermining the amount of work that escorts and prostitutes have to do for screening for their *safety*. Not only do they have to trust them to be physical with them, they have to trust them not to be cops, or not to be salty over the service and refer cops to them. Of course they're going to be a bit more sketched out and a little more conservative with their overall trust. The fact that you are actively trying to make this a negative when it's warranted is disturbing.",

The entire mentality is to extract as much money as possible in the least amount of time. One of the most important rules was to not form any real emotional attachments to the clients. Does it happen? Of course, escorts are human too, but its strongly not advised there. I found that escorting is seen as a job, with an hourly rate. You will pay me xxx amount for an hour of my time. You want an overnight? Youll pay thousands to have me that long. I would read tactics on how to zone out during intimacy, even comments on \"why do clients hold my hand during sex, why they look at me while giving a bj, i dont allow you to go diwn on me\" i got the feeling that many of these sex workers do not enjoy being with their clients, and without a doubt are master manipulators, clock watching and ready to get out of there asap. the truth is, escorts make a lot of money. And with these strict rules in place they will make much much more than your average sb. Once you get that taste of the money being a pro, its almost impossible to be a regular sb. Now, im not looking down on escorts or sex workers  at all, i think they have every right to operate how they wish, but its just not my cup of tea, and they certainly arent sbs.",

Experts don\u2019t usually take time off so they can stay on top of their field. Why, you may ask? Because of obsoletion/streamlining, shifting landscape, technology, etc. When you\u2019re gone for such a long time, some things may change\u2014yearly for example\u2014as SA has! \n\nIf I worked at a hedge fund (SR) in 2017, and stopped working there\u2014didn\u2019t even make a move laterally to a bulge-bracket bank (vanilla dating), but instead got a job working at a hotel as concierge, then I\u2019d be an EX-Portfolio Manager! Do you know how much has changed in two to three years? \n\n>When someone is straight and becomes single, are they not straight anymore? \n\nI\u2019m unsure if your reasoning skills are intact. Those aren\u2019t mutually exclusive whereas I\u2019m arguing that your \u201ctime off\u201d and your so called \u201cexpertise\u201d are mutually inclusive. \n\nI don\u2019t care about the days. \nYou just simply don\u2019t know what an expert is. \n\nWhat, pray tell, would I be hating??",

SO your bullshit technicalities and \"mod\" posts or whatever the fuck you're talking about really don't matter. I'm giving women that are in the same community as I have always been a part of and will always be a part of some very good and healthy advice. IF you are really gonna try to sit here and act like there is something wrong with telling a woman that she should wait to fuck someone until she is comfortable is fuckin weird or you're simply just a straight up hater. Don't try to pick it apart and say well you said it in this context or that context. It doesn't matter because in any situation ever - a woman should always have sex on her own terms. Prostitution or not. Reminding them of this is the right thing to do. So please get off my back already.",

Absolutely none of them turned into a sugar relationship. The ones that turned into sugar relationships were ones where the SD was, right out of the gate, paying for my time.

All my SRs but one happened when the SD showed an upfront investment and that he was serious about being there for me. Contrary to the opinion largely favored by men on this forum, the getting-to-know period should not be free- I believe a true SD would genuinely WANT to give a POT money to put her at ease and also show that he cares about her, that he wants a relationship- not just a quick hookup where sex is exchanged for money, and understands what this relationship is about. If he is a true SD and has the means, it's pocket change to him but shows a real commitment on his behalf to the girl. The man is the more powerful partner in this relationship and should behave as such by establishing trust from the offset- it's made out to be such a big deal that the M&G *must* be unpaid on this forum... but it's really not misaligned incentives to pay for one platonic date- it's a display of seriousness and integrity that will make any true SB respond in kind.",

I have theme parks here so if I suggest a theme park date then I can book a theme park hotel room. The entire date will feel like vanilla just like if I was out freelancing at a bar and hopefully we\u2019ll hook up via suggestions at the end of the date such as \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my room\u201d. \n\nIf she refuses then I\u2019d give it to... \n\n2nd Date - Not going to get a hotel in advance. If no natural intimacy happens then I say thanks for your time It was fun but I don\u2019t think we will work out. I\u2019m an open book so I\u2019ll tell her it\u2019s because I feel no chemistry or natural romance from her end. If they try to do a 180 I stick to my guns and don\u2019t allow it to go further cause that\u2019s creepy, obviously she\u2019s desperate and now rushing. But I\u2019m not going to keep being strung along either. If however she is open to the suggestion of going back to my room then I\u2019ll find a room and book it same night somewhere nice. \n\nNo I wouldn\u2019t be paying an allowance if we never made it to the bedroom. That\u2019s when I would physically present the allowance. Only time I would give an allowance outside of the bedroom would be if I trust you and we\u2019ve been intimate for some time already.",

There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

I was very clearly referring to couples who only post porn of themselves and happen to make a profit from them. I doubt they call themselves sex workers, I doubt they call themselves porn stars--but the fact remains that income was made from sex work. You feeling otherwise doesn't change the facts.",

Who said anything about charity? \n\nEither way. \u201cSR\u201d or \u201cvanilla\u201d I\u2019m spending thousands of dollars a month either way heh.

Stability/money and all that is part of it sure but if it\u2019s a primary rather than secondary motivator she can take a walk.\n\nThat\u2019s just worked for me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f No complaints so far.

I haven't seen an innovative argument about this topic in years. It's the same points over and over and over again. It's some variation of 1. Sex and money are involved so it's absolutely sex work. 2. Sometimes it is sex work and sometimes it isn't, 3. It's not sex work because the relationship element trumps the transactional elements. \n\nThat's it. 3,000+ words in this thread all boil down to that. It's boring.",

If you saw a comment that said \"I hope you get raped\" any mod would remove it and likely ban the user. And for the most part, permabans aren't immediately handed out which prevents us from looking like another sub that is just an echo chamber. All of our mods are adults with full time jobs and (presumably) their own SRs and the rules are set up so that one group (the supposed \"actually escorts\") isn't drowning out the other group(s) (\"Relationship SDs\", Experience daddies, platonics, etc.) One of our mods lives in Aus, which, given the current standings, means she might not be tied to her phone to check modmail every hour and that's super understandable. Especially since a majority of what they remove is probably Rule 2. Being a mod of a different subreddit and also admin/modding non-reddit commuities (discord) I get it. I think a majority of the rules and enforcements are done without a clear bias. I have seen way worse subreddits (strugglefucking and makeupaddiction are pretty bad.)\n\nIt's really just the \"no escort/john\" rule, which has had several edits and clarifications, and several threads have stayed and several have been banned without any real consistency. It's a difficult rule to moderate, and since clearly the sugar bowl is not static (we gain new terms, we lose terms, overall expectations shift with society) it is very difficult to make a long-standing rule addressing \\*all\\* of the issues without overtuning it or making it too general. Although, if you have a suggestion on it that doesn't skew one way or the other, I'm sure the mod team would love to hear about it.",

The  fact that the escort/john rule is not clear is part of the problem.     \n\n\nI agree and that's what I was trying to say. The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other. It is a difficult rule to shape without showing a clear and obvious bias towards any particular group, while still addressing the obvious/primary issue of using \"escort\" or \"cheap\" as insults.   \n\n\n\\>  enforce it every time. Not just when it suits you.\n\nI don't know how our mods work, but in any other community I've ever modded in, if there wasn't an automated mod log whenever an action was taken (facebook didn't have one for a long ass time), unless something was particularly egregious it's not even discussed why it's removed. I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason. But I'm not a mod and the mods typically don't discuss their reasoning outside of their quarterly community updates. I could be wrong about their structure.",

The chemistry, whether or not they  will regret it, whether or not they will enjoy it and ultimately whether  or not they even trust them - these are not a factor in the equation.\n\nImplying prostitutes and escorts don't have any standards?\n\n>  SB enjoys her SD's company, trusts him, actually feels pleasure when intimate, & most importantly respects him.\n\nImplying prostitutes and escorts don't respect their clients? Implying they can't trust clients? Implying they don't/can't enjoy their clients companionship?\n\n> The SD's are an SD for a reason too, they want something more than what a prostitute can give them.\n\nImplying that there is some sort of mystical force field of physics at work that prevent prostitutes and/or escorts from transitioning to being a certain guy's sugar baby. Almost like they aren't good enough, you know, because you've demonized them.\n\n>  if you are okay with being intimate with someone before you trust them  then that's ok! but you are an SB for a reason so you probably aren't  okay with that\n\nWhat...is the implied reason here? That if you sleep with someone you don't trust you aren't an SB? I'm missing it but given the previous language, what is it that you want people to imply?\n\nOverall you're implying escorts and prostitutes don't respect themselves, and SB's do and that's the difference between \"us\" and \"them\". You're also seriously undermining the amount of work that escorts and prostitutes have to do for screening for their *safety*. Not only do they have to trust them to be physical with them, they have to trust them not to be cops, or not to be salty over the service and refer cops to them. Of course they're going to be a bit more sketched out and a little more conservative with their overall trust. The fact that you are actively trying to make this a negative when it's warranted is disturbing.",

Contrary to the opinion largely favored by men on this forum, the getting-to-know period should not be free- I believe a true SD would genuinely WANT to give a POT money to put her at ease and also show that he cares about her, that he wants a relationship- not just a quick hookup where sex is exchanged for money, and understands what this relationship is about. If he is a true SD and has the means, it's pocket change to him but shows a real commitment on his behalf to the girl. The man is the more powerful partner in this relationship and should behave as such by establishing trust from the offset- it's made out to be such a big deal that the M&G *must* be unpaid on this forum... but it's really not misaligned incentives to pay for one platonic date- it's a display of seriousness and integrity that will make any true SB respond in kind.",

An SD cares about his partner and wants to show her that he is trustworthy, esp when she has so much on the line, doesn't know who she is dealing with at first, and has safety concerns like all other women- hardly a cold transaction, this is the process to start a relationship\n\n>As for power I disagree. Woman controls the sex 100%\n\nNot the kind of power I'm talking about. If a man decides on a whim that he no longer wants to see a girl, that is a huge opportunity cost for the woman- who set that time aside when she could have seen someone else or worked longer hours or spent time with her kids, has to spend hours looking presentable, driving all the way there, allocating time for the date, etc. Men who are unreliable and insist on PPM with no regard for the woman's welfare are treating her like a call-girl- that is not an SD and is an abuse of power.",

There are girls who post nudes on gone wild, or people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\". They're doing something they enjoy and getting paid for it. They probably refer to it as a side hustle AND hobby. They don't have to fit in two different circles and I think that's a majority of the issue people have when they hear someone else on SLF call sugaring sex work.

There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

It's not sex work because the relationship element trumps the transactional elements. \n\nThat's it. 3,000+ words in this thread all boil down to that. It's boring.",

If you saw a comment that said \"I hope you get raped\" any mod would remove it and likely ban the user. And for the most part, permabans aren't immediately handed out which prevents us from looking like another sub that is just an echo chamber. All of our mods are adults with full time jobs and (presumably) their own SRs and the rules are set up so that one group (the supposed \"actually escorts\") isn't drowning out the other group(s) (\"Relationship SDs\", Experience daddies, platonics, etc.) One of our mods lives in Aus, which, given the current standings, means she might not be tied to her phone to check modmail every hour and that's super understandable. Especially since a majority of what they remove is probably Rule 2. Being a mod of a different subreddit and also admin/modding non-reddit commuities (discord) I get it. I think a majority of the rules and enforcements are done without a clear bias. I have seen way worse subreddits (strugglefucking and makeupaddiction are pretty bad.)\n\nIt's really just the \"no escort/john\" rule, which has had several edits and clarifications, and several threads have stayed and several have been banned without any real consistency. It's a difficult rule to moderate, and since clearly the sugar bowl is not static (we gain new terms, we lose terms, overall expectations shift with society) it is very difficult to make a long-standing rule addressing \\*all\\* of the issues without overtuning it or making it too general. Although, if you have a suggestion on it that doesn't skew one way or the other, I'm sure the mod team would love to hear about it.",

The  fact that the escort/john rule is not clear is part of the problem.     \n\n\nI agree and that's what I was trying to say. The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other. It is a difficult rule to shape without showing a clear and obvious bias towards any particular group, while still addressing the obvious/primary issue of using \"escort\" or \"cheap\" as insults.   \n\n\n\\>  enforce it every time. Not just when it suits you.\n\nI don't know how our mods work, but in any other community I've ever modded in, if there wasn't an automated mod log whenever an action was taken (facebook didn't have one for a long ass time), unless something was particularly egregious it's not even discussed why it's removed. I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason. But I'm not a mod and the mods typically don't discuss their reasoning outside of their quarterly community updates. I could be wrong about their structure.",

Don't try to pick it apart and say well you said it in this context or that context. It doesn't matter because in any situation ever - a woman should always have sex on her own terms.

If a man decides on a whim that he no longer wants to see a girl, that is a huge opportunity cost for the woman- who set that time aside when she could have seen someone else or worked longer hours or spent time with her kids, has to spend hours looking presentable, driving all the way there, allocating time for the date, etc. Men who are unreliable and insist on PPM with no regard for the woman's welfare are treating her like a call-girl- that is not an SD and is an abuse of power.",

There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

Why are you insisting how I *feel* is not so?\n\n> That's just wrong. Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\ndon't be obtuse. I was very clearly referring to couples who only post porn of themselves and happen to make a profit from them. I doubt they call themselves sex workers, I doubt they call themselves porn stars--but the fact remains that income was made from sex work. You feeling otherwise doesn't change the facts.",

I haven't seen an innovative argument about this topic in years. It's the same points over and over and over again. It's some variation of 1. Sex and money are involved so it's absolutely sex work. 2. Sometimes it is sex work and sometimes it isn't, 3. It's not sex work because the relationship element trumps the transactional elements. \n\nThat's it. 3,000+ words in this thread all boil down to that. It's boring.",

If you saw a comment that said \"I hope you get raped\" any mod would remove it and likely ban the user. And for the most part, permabans aren't immediately handed out which prevents us from looking like another sub that is just an echo chamber. All of our mods are adults with full time jobs and (presumably) their own SRs and the rules are set up so that one group (the supposed \"actually escorts\") isn't drowning out the other group(s) (\"Relationship SDs\", Experience daddies, platonics, etc.) One of our mods lives in Aus, which, given the current standings, means she might not be tied to her phone to check modmail every hour and that's super understandable. Especially since a majority of what they remove is probably Rule 2. Being a mod of a different subreddit and also admin/modding non-reddit commuities (discord) I get it. I think a majority of the rules and enforcements are done without a clear bias. I have seen way worse subreddits (strugglefucking and makeupaddiction are pretty bad.)\n\nIt's really just the \"no escort/john\" rule, which has had several edits and clarifications, and several threads have stayed and several have been banned without any real consistency. It's a difficult rule to moderate, and since clearly the sugar bowl is not static (we gain new terms, we lose terms, overall expectations shift with society) it is very difficult to make a long-standing rule addressing \\*all\\* of the issues without overtuning it or making it too general. Although, if you have a suggestion on it that doesn't skew one way or the other, I'm sure the mod team would love to hear about it.",

The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other. It is a difficult rule to shape without showing a clear and obvious bias towards any particular group, while still addressing the obvious/primary issue of using \"escort\" or \"cheap\" as insults.   \n\n\n\\>  enforce it every time.

I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason. But I'm not a mod and the mods typically don't discuss their reasoning outside of their quarterly community updates. I could be wrong about their structure.",

If a man decides on a whim that he no longer wants to see a girl, that is a huge opportunity cost for the woman- who set that time aside when she could have seen someone else or worked longer hours or spent time with her kids, has to spend hours looking presentable, driving all the way there, allocating time for the date, etc. Men who are unreliable and insist on PPM with no regard for the woman's welfare are treating her like a call-girl- that is not an SD and is an abuse of power.",

There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

                    "body": ">Why does it have to be mutually exclusive?\n\nThe SBs I've seen who think of SRs as sex work treat it like a job. While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

I was very clearly referring to couples who only post porn of themselves and happen to make a profit from them. I doubt they call themselves sex workers, I doubt they call themselves porn stars--but the fact remains that income was made from sex work. You feeling otherwise doesn't change the facts.",

The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other.

I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason.

You seem to be assuming that people who admit it's sex work think of it as a job and that's all they think of it as.\n\nAbsolutely nailed it. There are many people who are fortunate enough to be doing a job that they love and treat it almost like a hobby. The dissonance here is that people cannot get over the fact that SR is a transaction and they do all the mental gymnastics they can to make it as not by calling it a version of vanilla dating. If that is the case then the Sugar Relationship is a superficial concept. Why not just call sugar babies girlfriends or mistresses then? After all they\u2019re not being compensated but rather \u201cspoiled.\u201d We do that already in vanilla. But of course the reality is it isn\u2019t vanilla. There is a rigid quid pro quo involved. Can feelings be involved in SR? Absolutely, and if the couple is lucky enough it might even turn into a full-fledged vanilla relationship. Where A doesn\u2019t have to be exchanged for B, but both are given anyways, unconditionally like a vanilla relationship.",

            "body": ">Why does it have to be mutually exclusive?\n\nThe SBs I've seen who think of SRs as sex work treat it like a job. While you can definitely enjoy your job, it's very rare to think of your boss as your actual friend. And that generally only lasts until you boss tells you to do or refrain from doing something. So, to an extent, they *are* mutually exclusive. Not always. There is *some* overlap on the Venn Diagram. But there are also two parts that *don't* overlap. \n\n>that people who admit it's sex work\n\nYou're begging the question. I reject the hypothesis that *all* SRs are sex work. It would be like admitting global warming is a hoax. \n\n>There are girls who post nudes on gone wild\n\nThey don't get paid so I don't know how that's a job.\n\n>people post home made porn with their spouse and get paid for it. \n\nYou think most of those spouses would describe themselves as sex workers? I imagine the ones who do have very different sex when the camera is on than when it isn't. Which is exactly what I'm looking to avoid. I want camera off sex.\n\n>Porn is still sex work but I doubt they consider it a \"job\".\n\n[That's just wrong](https://fortune.com/2016/02/05/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-porn/). Google can find you many other interviews with professional porn actors. They very much view it as a job.\n\n>Calling it sex work doesn't immediately nullify real relationships.\n\nNo. But *thinking* of it as sex work sure seems to. That's been my experience, anyway. I've seen SBs who think of SRs as sex work and those who don't. I've strongly preferred the relationships with the ones who don't think of SRs as sex work over the ones who do.",

I was very clearly referring to couples who only post porn of themselves and happen to make a profit from them. I doubt they call themselves sex workers, I doubt they call themselves porn stars--but the fact remains that income was made from sex work. You feeling otherwise doesn't change the facts.",

Especially not the ones who need an emotional connection and took me out on platonic dates at the start. But I absolutely think it is. And my job is to make my SD feel good about himself, which is why SDs don\u2019t need to know my honest views about our relationship, if there\u2019s a chance it could hurt the \u201cfantasy\u201d.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t enjoy my dates, or I don\u2019t like the SD as a person either. Your therapist can genuinely care for you and want you to do well, he\u2019s still working in your sessions. In any line of work you can enjoy what you\u2019re doing, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not work. But my SDs will only hear what I think they\u2019ll enjoy hearing, except if I need to address a specific issue. \n\nAs a SD I doubt you can know for sure what your SB thinks about your relationship, because there\u2019s a good chance that is she sees it as work she won\u2019t tell you anyway.

The issue is that it is hard to make that particular rule clear, concise, and modern in a way that they don't have to rephrase the rule every 6 months as sugar terms change, or as our demographic of users shift one way or the other.

I assume our mods trust and respect one another enough to know that if someone is removing or locking a thread, they had a good reason. But I'm not a mod and the mods typically don't discuss their reasoning outside of their quarterly community updates. I could be wrong about their structure.",
