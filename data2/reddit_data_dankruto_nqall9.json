If I\u2019m remembering correctly he learned the Lightning nature rasengan first but thought he was messing it up because it kept disappearing, and Sasuke was the one who noticed that it was actually a new technique. After this I believe he figured out how to do a normal rasengan, so he kinda learned the technique in reverse. I could be wrong tho\n\n>!Also there\u2019s the super compressed rasengan that he used in the anime against Deepa, the one that can destroy his arm, although I doubt we\u2019ll ever see that technique again cus it seemed to just be a power buff for that one fight!<",

After this I believe he figured out how to do a normal rasengan, so he kinda learned the technique in reverse. I could be wrong tho\n\n>!Also there\u2019s the super compressed rasengan that he used in the anime against Deepa, the one that can destroy his arm, although I doubt we\u2019ll ever see that technique again cus it seemed to just be a power buff for that one fight!<",

After this I believe he figured out how to do a normal rasengan, so he kinda learned the technique in reverse. I could be wrong tho\n\n>!Also there\u2019s the super compressed rasengan that he used in the anime against Deepa, the one that can destroy his arm, although I doubt we\u2019ll ever see that technique again cus it seemed to just be a power buff for that one fight!<",
