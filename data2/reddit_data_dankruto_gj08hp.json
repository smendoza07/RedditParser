Nobody was ever able to compete with minato in terms of FTG.\n\nBut in the case of the Rasengan, it was definitely mastered by minato, jiraiya, kakashi, naruto, etc. They all got the fundamental basis of compressing/rotating chakra fixed in their hand. Once it gets to the rasen-shuriken is when the mod is a completely new jutsu. Nobody (in Naruto) ever mastered or even was able to do that (boruto\u2019s rasengan is the closest thing but not the same and he hasn\u2019t \u201cmastered\u201d it IMO). A weird mix of the two explanations could be the massive rasengan, since it\u2019s the same mastery with just fuck ton more chakra.",

Like minato, tobirama, itachi, everyone in the akatsuki, many of the kage from all the villages, etc. You can claim that if a lot of them had \u201clived more\u201d they would have been even stronger, but shinobi tend to die young. \n\nI have to disagree about tobirama besting minato in a fight (i may be biased bc minato is my favorite character though). Tobirama admits that minato is faster than him and better than him at flying raijin. You have to remember that there was a flee on sight notice for minato. If you saw him, immediately run. While definitely being strong and legendary, Tobirama never did anything to warrant that. I think Tobiramas strengths are developing jutsu and tactical leadership, while minato skills are more battle focused. Plus (despite his seemingly false claims that he\u2019s bad at it) minato can also use sage jutsu which is a big boost in a fight as well.",

But more than one person had to work on each of his jutsus to master them. Minato worked on Raijin only. It took both Orochimaru and Kabuto to boost up Edo Tensei. Meanwhile Tobirama made all those techniques together by himself. And he would have had a better Raijin than Minato had he lived longer.",

Even after becoming a war hero Saskue should not just be put in solitary than converted to covert op. He made it known that his goal was to destroy The Leaf then associated himself with the most dangerous criminal organization in the world before making an attempt at multiple high level Shinobi and Kage's lives, killing Danzo in the process who was The Hokage at the time. Iirc being a rouge ninja alone is grounds for execution let alone doing all that. Saskue shouldn't be cool with the Leaf at all either. Despite Itachis beliefs and love for Naruto the fact remains that The Leaf murdered all of Saskue's family and turned him against his only living relative after burying the truth.",

Nobody was ever able to compete with minato in terms of FTG.\n\nBut in the case of the Rasengan, it was definitely mastered by minato, jiraiya, kakashi, naruto, etc. They all got the fundamental basis of compressing/rotating chakra fixed in their hand. Once it gets to the rasen-shuriken is when the mod is a completely new jutsu. Nobody (in Naruto) ever mastered or even was able to do that (boruto\u2019s rasengan is the closest thing but not the same and he hasn\u2019t \u201cmastered\u201d it IMO). A weird mix of the two explanations could be the massive rasengan, since it\u2019s the same mastery with just fuck ton more chakra.",

Like minato, tobirama, itachi, everyone in the akatsuki, many of the kage from all the villages, etc. You can claim that if a lot of them had \u201clived more\u201d they would have been even stronger, but shinobi tend to die young. \n\nI have to disagree about tobirama besting minato in a fight (i may be biased bc minato is my favorite character though). Tobirama admits that minato is faster than him and better than him at flying raijin. You have to remember that there was a flee on sight notice for minato. If you saw him, immediately run. While definitely being strong and legendary, Tobirama never did anything to warrant that. I think Tobiramas strengths are developing jutsu and tactical leadership, while minato skills are more battle focused. Plus (despite his seemingly false claims that he\u2019s bad at it) minato can also use sage jutsu which is a big boost in a fight as well.",

But more than one person had to work on each of his jutsus to master them. Minato worked on Raijin only. It took both Orochimaru and Kabuto to boost up Edo Tensei.

Nobody was ever able to compete with minato in terms of FTG.\n\nBut in the case of the Rasengan, it was definitely mastered by minato, jiraiya, kakashi, naruto, etc. They all got the fundamental basis of compressing/rotating chakra fixed in their hand. Once it gets to the rasen-shuriken is when the mod is a completely new jutsu. Nobody (in Naruto) ever mastered or even was able to do that (boruto\u2019s rasengan is the closest thing but not the same and he hasn\u2019t \u201cmastered\u201d it IMO). A weird mix of the two explanations could be the massive rasengan, since it\u2019s the same mastery with just fuck ton more chakra.",

Like minato, tobirama, itachi, everyone in the akatsuki, many of the kage from all the villages, etc. You can claim that if a lot of them had \u201clived more\u201d they would have been even stronger, but shinobi tend to die young. \n\nI have to disagree about tobirama besting minato in a fight (i may be biased bc minato is my favorite character though). Tobirama admits that minato is faster than him and better than him at flying raijin. You have to remember that there was a flee on sight notice for minato. If you saw him, immediately run. While definitely being strong and legendary, Tobirama never did anything to warrant that. I think Tobiramas strengths are developing jutsu and tactical leadership, while minato skills are more battle focused. Plus (despite his seemingly false claims that he\u2019s bad at it) minato can also use sage jutsu which is a big boost in a fight as well.",

But more than one person had to work on each of his jutsus to master them. Minato worked on Raijin only. It took both Orochimaru and Kabuto to boost up Edo Tensei.

Even after becoming a war hero Saskue should not just be put in solitary than converted to covert op. He made it known that his goal was to destroy The Leaf then associated himself with the most dangerous criminal organization in the world before making an attempt at multiple high level Shinobi and Kage's lives, killing Danzo in the process who was The Hokage at the time. Iirc being a rouge ninja alone is grounds for execution let alone doing all that. Saskue shouldn't be cool with the Leaf at all either. Despite Itachis beliefs and love for Naruto the fact remains that The Leaf murdered all of Saskue's family and turned him against his only living relative after burying the truth.",
