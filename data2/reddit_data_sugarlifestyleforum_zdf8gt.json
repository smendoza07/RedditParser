    "body": "First, this is purely a vent/rant, not really looking for advice.\n\nTl;dr - SB of almost 8 months has read online that my allowance isn't good enough and refused to meet with me even after the established monthly allowance was given this month.\n\nSo I got a call from my SB Friday night. It seems she's found her way onto Reddit and into some of these forums and has decided after talking to a couple \"veteran SBs\" that based on my financials I can afford to be giving her more than I do every month.\n\nFor context we met at the end of April on Seeking, went to a M&G (coffee that turned into dinner), had a second date without intimacy but full PPM (mutually agreed upon because I found myself with multiple POTs and I was trying to see who I had better chemistry with) and then a third date with intimacy. My PPM is pretty decent, mid XXX. She and I had an amazing time together in and out of the bedroom. She's a college student so over the summer we had a decent amount of free time. We went from seeing each other once a week in May to spending the weekends at my lake house by the beginning of June to wanting to travel together by July.\n\nWe moved from PPM to allowance and because I wanted her to be able to travel with me and she wanted to travel without having to worry about work or saving up for the upcoming semester (she usually would work full time plus an additional part time job to save up as much as she could so she only had to work very minimally during the school year) I offered her an allowance (mid-high 4 figures equal to PPM \\*10) and also paid her rent and other bills (phone, utilities, insurance, etc. but no car as she did not have a car payment). I also paid for our trips, the travel, accommodations, food, everything while we were together. We took trips by car because we both loved random Americana roadside attractions. We also traveled by plane when we want to get somewhere for a weekend. I thought we had a great arrangement and she kept telling me how much she loved it too.\n\nThen school started up at the end of August so I flew her home (we had been in Arizona and California at the time) and we kept in touch via text, phone calls and video chat. I kept giving her the allowance and also kept paying her bills, it had been comfortable to me at this point and I didn't think about it too much. I loved our time together and wanted her to be happy. She'd come fly out to me a few times a month for a weekend or I'd go back to her and we'd spend some time at the lake house. Because of mid-term exams and my own personal schedule I only saw her twice in October for a weekend each time and then a couple more times in November (I flew back to Arkansas and hung out there, she flew to me in NYC and we hung out there).\n\nSo then we get to December. We had been making plans for this coming weekend to head down to Jamaica. It was going to be her first international trip. I sent her allowance and flew to her to take her shopping for our trip. I go to her place to pick her up and... she's not there. I call her, I text her and nothing. I'm confused and worried but not really sure what to do. She's told me in the past that no one but her best friend and roommate knows about her sugaring and I don't have a contact number for her friend. I'm going over the options of what to do when I get a text from her. \"Sorry!!! (plus emojis), I'm with (best friend) and didn't realize the time. But I do wanna talk, can we talk tonight?\" I tell her I'm glad she's ok and I understand and yes, of course, we can talk tonight. I ask if she'd rather talk in person and she says no, phone will be best. My gut sank, I've been around long enough to know this will lead nowhere good. But I tell her sure, tell her to be safe and I head back home.\n\nA couple hours later she calls and hits with me how she knows about what I do (because we've talked about it) and she knows I must be making really good money (no hiding that, she's been to 2 out my 4 houses and heard me talk about the other two where my mom and sister each live and found an old pay stub from a bonus check). She tells me she found some friends online who have really opened her eyes to sugaring and how she thinks I should be supporting her even more and how she'd love it if I could buy her a new car for Christmas and double her allowance. I just sit there at first thinking there's no way she's serious so I begin to ask questions. After a little back and forth she tells she found some stuff on TikTok and then on Reddit and the forums on Reddit that really help a girl prioritize her life and figure out how to succeed. I ask her about Jamaica and she says she still wants to go, but \"it will cost me double\". I literally started to laugh and tell her that I don't appreciate being extorted and that if she had been so unhappy with me and our relationship she should have just said so. She says she's not extorting me, but just thinks that since I'm so successful that I can afford to give her more. I tell her I have loved our time together but we don't seem aligned anymore on how our relationship should be, but wish her well. She says \"Are you breaking up with me?\" and I tell her \"yes, I am. I seriously wish you nothing but the best\" and I hang up.\n\nI was going through my own personal bullshit a few weeks and some of that may have reflected in me and our relationship (despite me trying hard to not make it) so it's possible she went looking for either another SD or for advice on what to do. I'm honestly not sure how she found her way onto Reddit, but she did. She didn't mention any specific subs but from the context of her text messages I can guess which ones she found.\n\nNow this morning I wake up to texts from her last night asking if we can talk more. And 2 missed phone calls with  a voicemail where she's stressed because her rent is due today and I didn't pay it (I cancelled the auto-drafts for her rent and utilities. She had given me access to her payment portals so I went online and removed my billing information from her accounts and for good measure closed those accounts this morning) and how she had already spent part of her allowance on stuff for our trip and Christmas gifts for her family. My emotions are warring inside of me. Part of me says here is a woman you took care of and really like and the other part of me is saying fuck her, she ruined a good thing and is trying to manipulate you.",

I can't provide any companionship that you may want, but I'll match you drink for drink and we'll have a good chuckle lol",

                    "body": ">Ugh the disrespect here, no way I could recover from it.  \n\n\nThis hits the nail on the head. I've said it before. These things are about mutual respect. I'm not going to be in a SR with a woman who has her hand out and I see any language that implies it's more of a business deal to be a red flag. \n\nYes, I know that it is something of a business deal. I'm saying that part of the reason I do this is because I appreciate the veneer of discretion. \n\nPrior to beginning a relationship with a SB, we have a conversation about her needs which I use as a baseline in her PPM/Allowance etc. If she tells me, down the road, that her needs have changed, we can adjust as needed. \n\nHowever, I've noped out of situations when they made the conversation too transactional for me\n\nExamples:\n\nBefore the M&G \"Am I getting paid for this?\"\n\nAfter a first date, trying to arrange a second \"Oh, btw, I charge XXX now\" - the difference was nominal it was the use of the word \"charge\" that turned me off. Had she said something like \"my needs have changed and I'd like to ask for XXX instead of what we did last time\" I would have been totally ok with it. \n\nDuring the M&G \"when will you start paying me?\" Spoiler alert, I never did. \n\nWhile texting, pre M&G \"I charge XXX per hour\" that was a mess all around. \n\nAs a SD, I would never even dream of asking a woman \"so how much for...(use your imagination)\" because it's not about paying for intimacy. When the SBs of the world understand that, we'll be much better off.",

If she has rent and utilities, she\u2019s adult enough to understand risk/reward and have self-awareness of her decisions.\n\nShe fucked up, plain and simple. She could have come to you with a discussion on how she\u2019s come across differing opinions, she could have agreed to speak to you in person knowing you flew out and out of respect for your time and efforts, hell\u2014she could have accepted your separation from her as her own lesson instead of backtracking and trying to reach out to you.\n\nHonestly, I am livid on your behalf having read your story. I am sorry that happened to you. If you were taking care of her rent and utilities, on top of allowance and trips\u2014she had a good thing and she threw it away.\n\nI would love to have a potential do that (I\u2019ve yet to find one who supports me as such), and to even fathom risking that from a lack of gratitude, and her growing greed? I can\u2019t even imagine. The only situation I can think of where I would separate from such an arrangement would be a non-financial reason; an abusive situation, or differing goals, misalignment of interests. But never would I ask for double the allowance because of TikTok and Reddit? \n\nSir, you\u2019re better off without her and please, do not feel bad about it. She should have had better money management or thought of the consequences of her actions if her rent was due.",

Then on top of it traveling frequently around the country with everything paid for. Tons of SBs would kill for that kind of arrangement.\n\nShe threw it all away because of some internet snake women promising that she could get MORE. Her greed blinded her to even the possibility of losing everything she was currently getting from you. Trying to renegotiate the agreement just because \"You could give me more\" is a really weak place to start negotiating from. Let alone the disrespect and demands she placed forth just to continue the things moving forward.\n\nIf all she wanted was to \"help a girl prioritize her life and figure out how to succeed\" she easily could have done it with you at her back while living the good life. Sucks to be her. You're right to drop her like a rock and I'm sure you won't have much trouble finding someone new that would actually appreciate everything you offer them.\n\nDepending on how you feel, I could understand you covering her rent this one last time. Just because it's due and most likely she doesn't have the savings to cover it due to poor financial planning (Save some of that money when times are good!). No sense in kicking her when she's already down from finally realizing what she could actually lose. Tell her it's your final gift since it's the holidays and wash your hands of her. At least then she has the chance to find a job to cover the rest of her expenses.",

She could of said I really enjoy our time and if you think I'm worth it I would like to negotiate higher terms. Not you make more you should do more.

Nothing to do but clean break, no \"severance\"; the sweet person you knew is gone, and she'll only resent you more if you cover those bills.\n\nShe was around SA for a while and then last we'd spoken she'd dropped out of sugar.

More of a PPM situation ties the compensation closer to her actions.   With an allowance, perhaps the SB automatically thinks there will be XXXX reliably in her account (plus rent paid) for the next 12 months even if her treatment of you declines.  Keep your options open, and be willing to stop things at any week.  Keep the compensation to one stream of income, rather than pay for her various payments.

But then the Mick Jones (of Foreigner) lyrics kicked in: \u201cYou\u2019re as cold as ice\u2026\u201d.\n\nFrom my perspective, she turned cold, aloof, disrespectful, and greedy. The fabric of mutual reciprocity went out the window with her over the top, ATM-like mentality. She wanted to test me to see whether I would stand up for myself. I did the same thing you did. I ended the money transactions after notifying her as such and awaited her response. \n\nWhich came in one written word from her. She knew she made a major mistake: not seeing the forest for the trees. She lost out on xx,xxx\u2019s over a relatively short time horizon. No apology was ever attempted by her. \n\nIn your case, there was \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d and \u201cconsideration\u201d between you and your SB. She wanted to tear up the agreement, not thinking that your payment of her rent, miscellaneous expenses, etc. amounted to very very substantial financial and quality of life benefits for her. When the intimacy is BYWD (Beyond Your Wildest Dreams) from a man\u2019s perspective and emotional ties appear strong, major differences over dollars can collapse a relationship.\n\nIf I were a betting man, she and her girlfriends started pricing what high-end independent escorts show for their per-hour, overnight, and multi-day fee schedules. Akin to \u201cwhat are those hot girls charging in the biggest USA cities?\u201d. Going by what you\u2019ve written, the bespoke \u201ctotal package approach you provided her wasn\u2019t good enough anymore. As if she wanted a slice of your annual income and/or net worth. The pinball machine tilted\u2026\n\nTo quote Joni Mitchell from a half century ago, \u201cDon\u2019t it always seem to go, that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got \u2018til it\u2019s gone\u2026\u201d.",

I'm saying that part of the reason I do this is because I appreciate the veneer of discretion. \n\nPrior to beginning a relationship with a SB, we have a conversation about her needs which I use as a baseline in her PPM/Allowance etc. If she tells me, down the road, that her needs have changed, we can adjust as needed. \n\nHowever, I've noped out of situations when they made the conversation too transactional for me\n\nExamples:\n\nBefore the M&G \"Am I getting paid for this?\"\n\nAfter a first date, trying to arrange a second \"Oh, btw, I charge XXX now\" - the difference was nominal it was the use of the word \"charge\" that turned me off. Had she said something like \"my needs have changed and I'd like to ask for XXX instead of what we did last time\" I would have been totally ok with it. \n\nDuring the M&G \"when will you start paying me?\" Spoiler alert, I never did. \n\nWhile texting, pre M&G \"I charge XXX per hour\" that was a mess all around. \n\nAs a SD, I would never even dream of asking a woman \"so how much for...(use your imagination)\" because it's not about paying for intimacy.

So does someone who becomes a partner after you've set those terms for yourself suddenly get to decide they're entitled to a larger percentage just because they want more? Does someone who isn't your spouse or even long term, live in committed boy/girlfriend get to decide they should be able to know all about your finances? At what month with an SD do you give him your bank statements and let him know all of your income sources so he can decide if his allowance is fair to himself to give to you?",

But I'm a very generous person by nature for those I love. Not to say you loved her (and I may be biased based on my main SBF who calls his bi-annual bonuses 'our bonus') but she may have been under the impression that you were more emotionally entrenched than you were. \n\nAgain, I'm not defending her as I stated at the start of my comment.

So does someone who becomes a partner after you've set those terms for yourself suddenly get to decide they're entitled to a larger percentage just because they want more? Does someone who isn't your spouse or even long term, live in committed boy/girlfriend get to decide they should be able to know all about your finances? At what month with an SD do you give him your bank statements and let him know all of your income sources so he can decide if his allowance is fair to himself to give to you?",

I can't respect people who have no foresight and just kicks problems (especially *legal* problems) down the road, though I might be curious to look up how well all that is turning out for him.\n\nKevin's made his wealth with his money only, and his startup/capital group just started this past couple months and is more focused on equity growth which is much more in-line with my real estate investment strategy.\n\nCardone doesn't own 4 billion. He manages 4 billion worth investor money (before the pandemic anyway, as of 2022 Cardone Capital manages only $2 billion). His reported net worth is about 300 million at age 62. MeetKevin has a networth of 50 million at age 30 with his own money.",
