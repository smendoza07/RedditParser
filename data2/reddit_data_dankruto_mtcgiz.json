Seriously look at her mug at that diner scene. Now that's a turn on right there.",

She also never pressured him to learn her jutsu and only agreed to train him when he wanted to do it. Her son being happy comes first to being a talented ninja which considering how kids in the previous generations were raised is a massive step forward",

She\u2019s not given much screen time so we have to judge from the few scenes she has and she doesn\u2019t really do much in them. The reason why she\u2019s thought to be strong is that she actually gets proper development in the last movie and her power is actually shown to us, and also because hinata was probably to only appropriately strong female character in the anime till war arc development happened. \n\nThe problem really is that we don\u2019t have much to judge on and plus women were just made to be weak in naruto. It\u2019s also probably the fact that naruto and sasuke crash the power scaling with becoming gods which makes everyone else seem weak and useless in their comparison",

During the chunin exams she went into Sakura's head, copied her answers, then went into Shikamaru and Choji to have them pass, just because Shikamaru was too lazy to answer and have Choji copy his answers by linking his shadow. Then she risked dying to save Sakura even though she was the one who gave up on Ino in the first place.\n\nThen according to Asuma and Shikamaru she'd wipe the floor with Sakura but she was too kind. When she found a genius non-lethal way to beat her she was robbed because plot.\n\nIf Shikamaru took her to the Sasuke retrieval mission she'd be the perfect counter for Tayuya's stationary flute playing so Temari wouldn't have her cool moment to shine.\n\nDuring the Hidan and Kakuzu arc she located them easily, which was her purpose. Then she offered to 1v1 Hidan and you'd better believe she'd outsmart him into mind transfer and then walk over Shikamaru's trap to achieve the same result, but Hidan was Shikamaru's personal grudge to settle.\n\nAt least after the war most fans respect her and don't treat her as useless, even though some still treat her as such because she doesn't rely on raw strength.\n\nIno is great as is imo, and I think under a different author she'd be even more amazing. It helps that she was leader of her squad and actually did shit instead of being sad her love interest doesn't notice her/is evil.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character.

Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say.*\n\nMy entire point is that All except Sakura and TenTen are better characters than Ino. Despite some of them having less screentime.\n\n*I'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke.*\n\nYou're well are of the bad wring thats good. \n\n *But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke*\n\nPretty sure i said crush not Marry and if i didn't then that what I meant to say. She definetly crushed on Sai for the simple fact he looked like sasuke.\n\n*Her crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then.*\n\nyou can't delete what was written, its a stain on her character regardless.\n\n *But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her.*\n\nIt defines a large chunk of her character even in the war arc she runs up to sasuke. In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

Which is the point of the OP's post too. \n\nAnd FOR ME, she's definitely above most of the characters who we have nothing to even discuss about, who are featless in shippuden and non existent in blank period and boruto.

She managed to awaken the byakuga seal at 16 when even shizune wasnt able to do it at her age. She also managed to keep naruto alive for a long time after the nine tails was pulled out from him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wont say any of their writing was perfect but the way i see it, people can either focus on all negative aspects of a character or also try to see the positive ones, bc god knows i could point our more flaws in ino if i wanted to be a hater",

It's also a high class Hyuga technique requiring exceptional chakra control. Other than that, by the end of Shippuden she's been deemed a \"Master\" of the Gentle Fist meaning she can do pretty much everything Hiashi and Neji can but she has Hamura Otsutsuki's chakra so there's that. \nI honestly think it's in keeping with her character though, she's always had potential but she just always hated fighting hence she never gave it her best during training and she also suffered from self doubt due to being disowned. During the scene where she performs the 64 palms it was revealed that it wasn't a matter of she couldn't do it, it was moreso her always being afraid to try as she thought it was beyond her limits (Hence what Neji said). After the chunin exams and Naruto inspired her she then started to work harder and she definitely became stronger.",

She\u2019s not given much screen time so we have to judge from the few scenes she has and she doesn\u2019t really do much in them. The reason why she\u2019s thought to be strong is that she actually gets proper development in the last movie and her power is actually shown to us, and also because hinata was probably to only appropriately strong female character in the anime till war arc development happened. \n\nThe problem really is that we don\u2019t have much to judge on and plus women were just made to be weak in naruto. It\u2019s also probably the fact that naruto and sasuke crash the power scaling with becoming gods which makes everyone else seem weak and useless in their comparison",

Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent. These feats are infact A LOT for a side character from naruto and far superior than anything Tenten, Shino, Kiba, Lee and Neji has done in shippuden. \n\nSure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say.*\n\nMy entire point is that All except Sakura and TenTen are better characters than Ino. Despite some of them having less screentime.\n\n*I'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke.*\n\nYou're well are of the bad wring thats good. \n\n *But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke*\n\nPretty sure i said crush not Marry and if i didn't then that what I meant to say. She definetly crushed on Sai for the simple fact he looked like sasuke.\n\n*Her crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then.*\n\nyou can't delete what was written, its a stain on her character regardless.\n\n *But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her.*\n\nIt defines a large chunk of her character even in the war arc she runs up to sasuke. In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

In shippuden she was still a kid of 15, it would still be a childhood crush, and her moving on from sasuke arc was in blank period. \nFor me, still, the massive development she recieved in the second half of shippuden, in the blank period novels and currently in boruto overshadows and fixes the flaws in her character in the past. Which is the point of the OP's post too. \n\nAnd FOR ME, she's definitely above most of the characters who we have nothing to even discuss about, who are featless in shippuden and non existent in blank period and boruto. Some like shino and kiba didnt even have anything going with their characters to be even compared with ino. Good day",

During the scene where she performs the 64 palms it was revealed that it wasn't a matter of she couldn't do it, it was moreso her always being afraid to try as she thought it was beyond her limits (Hence what Neji said). After the chunin exams and Naruto inspired her she then started to work harder and she definitely became stronger.",

It was kinda like how naruto started his one sided rivalry with sasuke and attacked him and tied him up for no reason other than the fact that sasuke was the best in class n was sakura's crush even tho sasuke defended naruto from sakura and nearly sacrificed his life for naruto's sake. \n\n Kishimoto just couldn't comprehend the thought of two women having a rivalry over strength and capabilities so had to make their rivalry over a boy.

It's understandable why you'd think that then. \nI mean that's true shonen females aren't always written the best but I think for Naruto's standards she does well.

I also understand why others aren't a fan of it though lol. \n\nBoruto's not that bad but eh lol if you don't like it that's okay. I liked how we could talk without any disrespect lol.",

The reason why she\u2019s thought to be strong is that she actually gets proper development in the last movie and her power is actually shown to us, and also because hinata was probably to only appropriately strong female character in the anime till war arc development happened. \n\nThe problem really is that we don\u2019t have much to judge on and plus women were just made to be weak in naruto. It\u2019s also probably the fact that naruto and sasuke crash the power scaling with becoming gods which makes everyone else seem weak and useless in their comparison",

My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

She definetly crushed on Sai for the simple fact he looked like sasuke.\n\n*Her crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then.*\n\nyou can't delete what was written, its a stain on her character regardless.\n\n *But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her.*\n\nIt defines a large chunk of her character even in the war arc she runs up to sasuke. In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

I don\u2019t see how tsunade would give shikamaru the lead role on like a thousand missions and even be given second in command in the war but ino is still somehow the leader of their team. \nI could go watch a random naruto episode and I bet shikamaru is telling his team the strategy their gonna use or how they are gonna take down their enemy.",

It's also a high class Hyuga technique requiring exceptional chakra control. Other than that, by the end of Shippuden she's been deemed a \"Master\" of the Gentle Fist meaning she can do pretty much everything Hiashi and Neji can but she has Hamura Otsutsuki's chakra so there's that. \nI honestly think it's in keeping with her character though, she's always had potential but she just always hated fighting hence she never gave it her best during training and she also suffered from self doubt due to being disowned. During the scene where she performs the 64 palms it was revealed that it wasn't a matter of she couldn't do it, it was moreso her always being afraid to try as she thought it was beyond her limits (Hence what Neji said). After the chunin exams and Naruto inspired her she then started to work harder and she definitely became stronger.",

Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent. These feats are infact A LOT for a side character from naruto and far superior than anything Tenten, Shino, Kiba, Lee and Neji has done in shippuden. \n\nSure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.",

She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only. In all time screentime I'm pretty sure she has less than Rock Lee, Neji, Sakura Naruto, Choji, Hinata, and Shikamaru.  That is 7 of them, so having more time then Kiba, Shino, and TenTen isn't saying much . Those other three also don;t have the bad writing that Ino has a little bit of with her crush on sasuke.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

In the last popularity poll in Naruto Kiba beat her, and Shino tied with her for votes?\n\nSome like shino and kiba didnt even have anything going with their characters to be even compared with ino. They also didn't have a a guy who was a mass murder. Just because a character has more depth doesn't make them better written.\n\nKishimoto wasn't great at writing female characters and Ino was an example of that.",

You're delusional if u think a character with more depth, feats, relevancy and development is not better written than some characters who only existed for one or two moments on comic relief in the entire manga and did nothing, had no depth or relevancy or feats at all rofl. Your personal preference doesnt say shit about how good the character is when ino is objectively better written then most of them i stated previously.",

Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent.

She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only.

That is 7 of them, so having more time then Kiba, Shino, and TenTen isn't saying much . Those other three also don;t have the bad writing that Ino has a little bit of with her crush on sasuke.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say.*\n\nMy entire point is that All except Sakura and TenTen are better characters than Ino. Despite some of them having less screentime.\n\n*I'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke.*\n\nYou're well are of the bad wring thats good. \n\n *But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke*\n\nPretty sure i said crush not Marry and if i didn't then that what I meant to say. She definetly crushed on Sai for the simple fact he looked like sasuke.\n\n*Her crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then.*\n\nyou can't delete what was written, its a stain on her character regardless.\n\n *But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her.*\n\nIt defines a large chunk of her character even in the war arc she runs up to sasuke. In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

Which is the point of the OP's post too. \n\nAnd FOR ME, she's definitely above most of the characters who we have nothing to even discuss about, who are featless in shippuden and non existent in blank period and boruto.

I watched all episodes and I can definitely say I was struggling to stay interested lol but I did  and i'm really enjoying the current arc with the new character - Kawaki. \n\nIf you're not a fan of the anime i'd suggest reading the manga as it's getting really good imo. \n\nIt was great talking to you  and have a great day.",

Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent. These feats are infact A LOT for a side character from naruto and far superior than anything Tenten, Shino, Kiba, Lee and Neji has done in shippuden. \n\nSure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.",

She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only.

That is 7 of them, so having more time then Kiba, Shino, and TenTen isn't saying much . Those other three also don;t have the bad writing that Ino has a little bit of with her crush on sasuke.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino.

Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*.

You're delusional if u think a character with more depth, feats, relevancy and development is not better written than some characters who only existed for one or two moments on comic relief in the entire manga and did nothing, had no depth or relevancy or feats at all rofl. Your personal preference doesnt say shit about how good the character is when ino is objectively better written then most of them i stated previously.",

I watched all episodes and I can definitely say I was struggling to stay interested lol but I did  and i'm really enjoying the current arc with the new character - Kawaki. \n\nIf you're not a fan of the anime i'd suggest reading the manga as it's getting really good imo. \n\nIt was great talking to you  and have a great day.",

Speaking of Neji and Lee, just lol, in the first arc of shippuden they barely did anything, and they were entirely erased from the rest of the show and boruto series along with shino, kiba, tenten etc.. \n\nFyi, The war arc lasted the entire second-half of shippuden. Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent. These feats are infact A LOT for a side character from naruto and far superior than anything Tenten, Shino, Kiba, Lee and Neji has done in shippuden. \n\nSure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.",

More compelling arcs thats why.\n\nIf you belive those feats make her a great character so be it. Just know Ino was dated Sai because she looked like sasuke. She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only. In all time screentime I'm pretty sure she has less than Rock Lee, Neji, Sakura Naruto, Choji, Hinata, and Shikamaru.  That is 7 of them, so having more time then Kiba, Shino, and TenTen isn't saying much . Those other three also don;t have the bad writing that Ino has a little bit of with her crush on sasuke.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent. These feats are infact A LOT for a side character from naruto and far superior than anything Tenten, Shino, Kiba, Lee and Neji has done in shippuden. \n\nSure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.",

She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only. In all time screentime I'm pretty sure she has less than Rock Lee, Neji, Sakura Naruto, Choji, Hinata, and Shikamaru.  That is 7 of them, so having more time then Kiba, Shino, and TenTen isn't saying much . Those other three also don;t have the bad writing that Ino has a little bit of with her crush on sasuke.",

They are basically featless in shippuden. Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino.

Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime.

Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*.

Ino sealed a pseudo jinchuriki, she played a phenomenal role in team 10's fight against asuma, she shifted the target of an entire tailed beast bomb by controlling the tentails saving everyone, she took obito's control over tentails, she connected the entire alliance and later the entire world with her telepathy right after her father's death, got acknowledged by hashirama and is currently the leader of the sensory division and the intelligence division of the village, being the top most important persons and an ideal parent. These feats are infact A LOT for a side character from naruto and far superior than anything Tenten, Shino, Kiba, Lee and Neji has done in shippuden. \n\nSure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.",

She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only. In all time screentime I'm pretty sure she has less than Rock Lee, Neji, Sakura Naruto, Choji, Hinata, and Shikamaru.  That is 7 of them, so having more time then Kiba, Shino, and TenTen isn't saying much . Those other three also don;t have the bad writing that Ino has a little bit of with her crush on sasuke.",

Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character.

In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

Which is the point of the OP's post too. \n\nAnd FOR ME, she's definitely above most of the characters who we have nothing to even discuss about, who are featless in shippuden and non existent in blank period and boruto.

She was crying when the other members of Konoha 11 said sasuke needed to be kill a boy who never is even shown to speak to her. https://imgur.com/2KP36qw After all those years she still had feelings for sasuke crying over him and stuff but she is best girl right?\n\nKishimoto  said he can't write female characters and it shows with Ino still. \n\n*Sure, Ino isn't that great of a character, especially compared to the main characters but what i'm saying is that she is still much much better than some nobodies of konoha 11.*\n\nI would rank her above Sakura and Tenten only. In all time screentime I'm pretty sure she has less than Rock Lee, Neji, Sakura Naruto, Choji, Hinata, and Shikamaru.

Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

You're delusional if u think a character with more depth, feats, relevancy and development is not better written than some characters who only existed for one or two moments on comic relief in the entire manga and did nothing, had no depth or relevancy or feats at all rofl. Your personal preference doesnt say shit about how good the character is when ino is objectively better written then most of them i stated previously.",

Ino took time to show her development, which is why she remains an underrated character along with her feats. My entire point was that she's above shino, tenten, kiba, and in shippuden, above choji, lee and neji too in terms of relevancy and contributions which is objectively correct. Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say. Just my opinion.\n\nI'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke. But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke. There is an entire canon novel which explains her love life, how she moved on from sasuke, why she fell in love with sai and how her relationship ship with sai made her feel she has best husband she could ask for, and boruto currently shows she has arguably the best married life, which again gave her tons of development all in canon sources.\n\nHer crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then. But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her. Her character involves saving sakura from bullies and protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him - getting stronger as a result, keeping her teammates in line in her sensei's absence, losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult, and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life. \n\nAlso, here is the screentime of naruto characters:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nAs you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.\n\nIno's character grew on me, and i think it depends on perspective on how we see her character. She definitely ranks high up for me in konoha 11, and you are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel.",

In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",

Kishi simply erased all of konoha 11 except team 7, 10 and hinata id say.*\n\nMy entire point is that All except Sakura and TenTen are better characters than Ino. Despite some of them having less screentime.\n\n*I'm well aware of Ino's crush on sasuke.*\n\nYou're well are of the bad wring thats good. \n\n *But you are also very wrong if u believe Ino only married sai cause she he looks like Sasuke*\n\nPretty sure i said crush not Marry and if i didn't then that what I meant to say. She definetly crushed on Sai for the simple fact he looked like sasuke.\n\n*Her crying over sasuke was again from first half of shippuden, and i, and the OP's post have agreed that she was not a character who stood out at all back then.*\n\nyou can't delete what was written, its a stain on her character regardless.\n\n *But you can't just use her crush on sasuke to describe her entire character when it's probably the last thing that defines her.*\n\nIt defines a large chunk of her character even in the war arc she runs up to sasuke. In the dream Tsukyomi she was in she was thinking of sasuke.\n\n*Her character involves saving sakura from bullies* \n\nand that resulted in the worst fight in the series Sakura vs Ino. It was good writing the problem is how there friendship ended because of sasuke garbage tier writing.\n\n*protecting her, losing her sensei and getting revenge for him*\n \nDoing absolutely nothing in that fight, it was all **Shikamaru, Naruto and Kakashi**. \n\n*losing her father and getting revenge for him and surpassing him, carrying her father's many legacies as an adult,*\n\nI gave you all that already. Doesn't delete the bad writing that she has *and lastly moving on from her childhood crush and finding the true love of her life*. Moving on from a not even a childhood crush cause she still feelings during the war is not compelling. It sad it happened in the first place so dang late, she should have never had feelings from him in Shippuden\n\n*Also, here is the screentime of naruto characters: https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ar6p10/top_100_characters_in_shippuden_by_episode_count/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf As you can see, In shippuden, ino has more screentime than all of konoha 11 except team 7 and shikamaru.*\n\nNow do all time screentime. Just because she had more screentime then Rock Lee in shippuden doesn't make her a better character. Rock Lee, and Neji are better written then she ever was.\n\n*You are free to rank her second last or last even if thats what you feel*. If Kishimoto hadn't done all the sasuke stuff she would rank higher for me.",
