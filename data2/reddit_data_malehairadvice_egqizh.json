I also went with a minoxidil and finasteride treatment to help keep what I got, at least for a few more years and I can tell it\u2019s helping me keep what hairs I have. Also something else I actually recently tried that is perfect for guys like us with lots of hairs remaining is that faux hair stuff one can shake/spray on. I thought it was absolutely ridiculous until I tried it just once. Really makes your head look full and no one can notice. Could really help in keeping a hair look for more years. It has for me, hopefully this helps.",

Although your problem area is apparent in the longer cut, the shorter cut seems to make it much more pronounced.

Since you still have good side hair (which not everyone does), you'd probably be ideal for that. Much less expensive than a transplant. But shaving it off is even cheaper. :)",

Also something else I actually recently tried that is perfect for guys like us with lots of hairs remaining is that faux hair stuff one can shake/spray on. I thought it was absolutely ridiculous until I tried it just once. Really makes your head look full and no one can notice. Could really help in keeping a hair look for more years. It has for me, hopefully this helps.",

It's surgical, very expensive and there's no guarantee that it will work. \n\nWhat I was talking about was non-surgical hair replacement--basically a hair piece that's designed to cover only the problem area. Since you still have good side hair (which not everyone does), you'd probably be ideal for that. Much less expensive than a transplant. But shaving it off is even cheaper. :)",
