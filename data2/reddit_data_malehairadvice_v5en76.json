            "body": "In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.",

I shampoo and condition my hair as needed approximately twice a week depending on how my scalp feels and when my hair appears greasy. After a wash day, your hair will likely not be able to style like this. \n\n   However, once the natural oils build back up, you should be able to attain this look by first rinsing your hair in the shower and using your fingers to comb and slick back all your hair towards the back of your head. Once you do that, the next step is to decide where you want the part to be. The best location will be based on face shape and prop portions. I typically do mine a tad bit to the left of the center. Take a comb and run it straight back from the point you wanted your hair to be parted at. This will cause the hair to seperate and to fall to either the right or left side. \n   I typically finger comb my hair back more a couple times to give it some more structure and you\u2019ll notice at this point the part will be more defined. \n\n      The last thing I would recommend would be to finger comb all your hair back and up towards the back of the crown to add more volume. \n   Comb your fingers straight back through your hair one last time after this and when it finishes air drying it should result in a similar style. \n   There are matte products you could use following a wash to circumvent the need to accumulate oils on the hair and scalp. I would recommend something water based as with that amount of hair you probably shouldn\u2019t be washing it with shampoo every single day but YRMV.",

Then I style my hair by running my hands through and then I apply dry spray wax also by evo called \u201cshebang-a-bang\u201d. Then I just run my hands through my hair all day and it gets wavier and wavier.\n\nIt\u2019s changed the game for me because my hair is lighter and flowier after a fresh wash, holds the waves better.",

He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter,\u00a0cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this;\u00a0Fore!, their most accomplished album.\u00a0I think their undisputed masterpiece is \"Hip To Be Square\".\u00a0A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should! Because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.\u00a0",
