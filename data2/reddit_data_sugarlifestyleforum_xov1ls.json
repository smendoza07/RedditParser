    "body": "I\u2019ve been seeing this SD for about 2mo but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever spent the night. At first everything was fine as it normally is. We went to spa/bathhouse first then had a nice dinner and dessert, then went to a hotel for intimacy. The problems started when it was time to sleep. We stayed up until around 1am (which is fine) but I had to leave at 8am for work. I love nighttime cuddles but SD just would not stop fondling me while I was trying to sleep. I had to push his hand away multiple times until I got so frustrated that I just moved to the other side of the bed. When he finally fell asleep his snoring was out of control so I didn\u2019t fall asleep until much later. At around 5am he starts fondling me again, trying to wake me up for morning sex. Normally that\u2019s not a problem but 5am???? Please be forreal.  I told him bluntly not to wake me up until 7. He let me sleep until 7 then wakes me up saying I\u2019m \u201ca mean grumpy bitch in the mornings.\u201d I\u2019ve never been so annoyed in my entire life. I left without giving him morning sex but still got my ppm.  The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I actually enjoyed the previous dates I had with this SD and he was pretty generous but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever want to see him again.",

And stressing they needed to work in the morning and needed sleep was probably another way of not directly saying no, but still saying no. Even the moving to the other side of them bed and to have him continue *after that*, it just seems weird to me",

It was our routine and when I say I have to get up early cuz of some reason she would be like ..\" okay well then we have to wake up earlier for an sex...lol.  We were together for years.  Then I have had overnight after my ex later on when my expectations were very clear and had even asked the new SB multiple times if this and that would be fine with her she would say sure no problem. Then the night came there was no second evening round and no morning sex and she snored loudly that I couldn't sleep at all. So basically 1.5 times our regular ppm for twice the negative fun. And she wondered when we were gonna have our next overnight cuz she liked it. I basically told her I'm glad one of us did and never ever.  She contacted me like a year later out of the blue and asked me if I was seeing anyone I just told her yep and she inquired if we were exclusive and I just told her that our last date wasn't the great for me and that's why I never asked her out again. The overnight just showed me we just don't have the chemistry I need.  Chemistry outside the bedroom was awesome but in the bedroom it was painful. Like nothing was good.  She was hot too.",

He would also lick my neck. This fucking happened until like 3am and it was the worst. I felt so gross after I immediately had a shower and tried to forget about it . Looking back now I would have fcking slapped him and walked out but I couldn\u2019t coz I can\u2019t drive and it was in a small town in the middle of the night. Definitely not ever doing that again but he still messages me til this day once a month lol",

Clearly you\u2019re not up for the 5 AM sex. Lots of people just need to sleep alone even if they love affection. Sometimes I\u2019ll get a room with two beds for flexability, especially if I\u2019m uncertain of a SBs sleeping habits.

Also I'm discussing what should have happened prior to the sleepover not what actually happened. I don't condone any type of sexual violence.\nThat being said this is a great example it looks like of a lack of communication. Both of you failed at talking about boundaries on sleep over nights and also what to expect. It's not really anyone's fault to not do that. Don't blame yourself, it's a common mistake. But just think how the night would have been if the two of you had a conversation that went something like...\n\"So beings this is our first sleep over I like to be cuddled but play time is over, also I really enjoy morning sex but only after a good night's sleep. So please don't wake me until around 7am. I promise you won't regret waiting. One more thing Captian Studmuffin I'm a quit sleeper, if you happen to not be it's no big deal just let me know so I can be prepared is all wink wink hugs hugs.\n\nOr from his prospective which from someonewho is supposed to be more mature should have handled it....\n\" So I know this is our first sleepover and I just wanted to clear the air on a few things before we actually spend the night. #1 I'm a loud sleeper, I hope that doesn't bother you but if it does let me know and either we can make other arrangements like once we have fun and cuddle a bit ill go sleep on the couch or wherever... #2 since this is our first sleepover are there any extra boundaries I need to know about? Like are you ok with being woke up for sex you know know things like that also sometimes I can get a little handsy when cuddling just because you turn me on so much, please let me know if that is inappropriate or if it becomes that way. I look forward to our night together Cinderella hope you do too\"\n\nI say these things because communication is always vital, and ongoing. Anything that becomes new in the relationship needs to be discussed.",

It was our routine and when I say I have to get up early cuz of some reason she would be like ..\" okay well then we have to wake up earlier for an sex...lol.  We were together for years.  Then I have had overnight after my ex later on when my expectations were very clear and had even asked the new SB multiple times if this and that would be fine with her she would say sure no problem. Then the night came there was no second evening round and no morning sex and she snored loudly that I couldn't sleep at all. So basically 1.5 times our regular ppm for twice the negative fun. And she wondered when we were gonna have our next overnight cuz she liked it. I basically told her I'm glad one of us did and never ever.  She contacted me like a year later out of the blue and asked me if I was seeing anyone I just told her yep and she inquired if we were exclusive and I just told her that our last date wasn't the great for me and that's why I never asked her out again. The overnight just showed me we just don't have the chemistry I need.  Chemistry outside the bedroom was awesome but in the bedroom it was painful. Like nothing was good.  She was hot too.",

I think a lot of the time the dynamic is the SD harvesting sex from SB and her \u201cgiving it up\u201d even in cases where she really likes it.  It\u2019s one reason to be very careful with BDSM etc in SRs.  Its tough because the sex I prefer is often with me taking an \u201cuncompromising\u201d stance for the sake of the energy, but it could be read as regular demands rather than artfully contrived demanding vibe.",

I think a lot of the time the dynamic is the SD harvesting sex from SB and her \u201cgiving it up\u201d even in cases where she really likes it.  It\u2019s one reason to be very careful with BDSM etc in SRs.  Its tough because the sex I prefer is often with me taking an \u201cuncompromising\u201d stance for the sake of the energy, but it could be read as regular demands rather than artfully contrived demanding vibe.",
