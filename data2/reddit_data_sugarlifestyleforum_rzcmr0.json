OF COURSE there is a financial aspect to this, WHY ELSE would I be talking to men more than twice my age? I would not expect to have someone pay me for a platonic relationship, so why should I have a sexual relationship with an \u201cSD\u201d for free? I just don\u2019t get it. Why are there so many guys like this on SA?",

Also putting 'I only want a wealthy man' on a regular dating site isn't really going to make you any friends. It'll turn off the 'regulars' and the rich guys among them will probably see it as a red flag.\n\nSo the other reason is that they can be explicit about what they want (even if they have to wade through a bunch of bullshit and scammers to get it)",

I am thunderstruck and enamored, she is just amazing.  On our first date, she made it clear that she doesn\u2019t ever want to feel like a hooker, and used that phrase.  Second date, she offers to split the check! This was after we had a convo about me providing an allowance! Third date we talked about medical history (she has a lifetime condition that requires consideration), STDs and getting tested, which we are doing already, plus great street tacos with green sauce!  4th date is a nice dinner with margaritas, some light touch and an agreement that we are gonna do this.  5th date tonight, I only had a sitter for 2 hours, so we meet for drinks in the bar of a 5-star resort mainly because they offer quiet corners.  Good lord, we cant stop talking and being excited!  I\u2019m out of time, we\u2019ve already planned an excursion in three weeks to go on a BBQ run for 3 days, with a break in the middle for Spa time.\n\nOther than a few kisses and some heavy flirting, we have not gone physical yet, but nor has any sugar($) been exchanged.  Yet we are both having a great time.\n\nOvernight at my home planned for later this week.  She\u2019s going to cook us dinner, then we are gonna watch North By NorthWest.  Good googly-moogly, the bowl can be soooo good!",

Meaning that she has not even read my preliminary message or viewed my profile. The younger men have lots of options. They are most coveted, competed for, and therefore have the luxury of getting what they want, and giving less if anything.

So her original plan of getting a laptop and college funds or her own escape from home was instead traded out for sex for three days, half of a subway sandwich, some wine and weed with a fruit plate. She was happy, but god she veered far off the path...\n\nThere's girls who will do it, so there's an overabundance of men who try their luck. Since worst case scenario, they killed a few hours, and ended up the same spot they began; without any sugar to give nor get.\n\nSame reason for the overabundance of girls who want platonic stuff. Since there's naive guys who will send women money even if they don't know them without verifying if scammer or not. (I.e. a guy I went on a date with who talked about how he sent 50 dollars to a 'random pretty woman who texted him about supposedly getting his number off WYP' and they never met at all.)",

Hell, some girls even chase down guys they get the tingles for and the guy gives zero attention and makes them split the bill. So, as a guy, why not give it a try?\n\nIts all very individual - the person and situation.\n\nI think the bigger challenge is keeping an open mind - both SBs and SDs - from the get go.\n\nMany POT SBs feel it's appropriate or ok to ask for handouts after 4 texts. It's not. It's disrespectful. And the SBs assume the SDs they are talking to are disgusting and gross.\n\nJust as SBs say \"I know my worth\", I know mine as a man. \n\nFor me, I am decent looking, I stay in shape by going to the gym, I'm wildly successful compared to 99% of my peers, I can hold a conversation, I can ensure a great and safe night out. I'm a catch and I have that power - I refuse to \"take advantage\" of it.  If I say I will deliver $X allowance, I do. It's an absolute pleasure to share what I have with an SB that enjoys and appreciates my time.\n\nThe challenge is many SBs feel they are entitled to my money just because they think they are hot.\n\nI deliver by being successful beyond what 99% of men or women can ever imagine, by being authentic and by delivering on my promises (both SRs and business) and I don't try to power play that against SBs.",

All these combined, pragmatically make it a good choice for men whether they are looking to be an SD or not to use SA. \n\nPersonally im open to being an SD for the right girl, but ive had vanilla a handful of times from seeking as well. \n\nYeah I know its annoying to a lot of sbs for non sds to be on SA, but trust me the guys have a shit ton of annoyances on there as well with all the platonics, pic sellers etc. Just vet and move on.",

Our only choices as \u201clegacy\u201d sugarers is to either adapt or branch out and find or create a new foothold for the way things used to be.  \n\nI\u2019m on my 5th Platonic date with my latest POT.  I am thunderstruck and enamored, she is just amazing.  On our first date, she made it clear that she doesn\u2019t ever want to feel like a hooker, and used that phrase.  Second date, she offers to split the check! This was after we had a convo about me providing an allowance! Third date we talked about medical history (she has a lifetime condition that requires consideration), STDs and getting tested, which we are doing already, plus great street tacos with green sauce!  4th date is a nice dinner with margaritas, some light touch and an agreement that we are gonna do this.  5th date tonight, I only had a sitter for 2 hours, so we meet for drinks in the bar of a 5-star resort mainly because they offer quiet corners.  Good lord, we cant stop talking and being excited!  I\u2019m out of time, we\u2019ve already planned an excursion in three weeks to go on a BBQ run for 3 days, with a break in the middle for Spa time.\n\nOther than a few kisses and some heavy flirting, we have not gone physical yet, but nor has any sugar($) been exchanged.  Yet we are both having a great time.\n\nOvernight at my home planned for later this week.  She\u2019s going to cook us dinner, then we are gonna watch North By NorthWest.  Good googly-moogly, the bowl can be soooo good!",

Its also not predominantly swipe based, which tends to make tinder/bumble mostly looked based. A lot of women swipe left on most profiles after a millisecond based solely on looks. Another thing is on tinder/bumble a lot of women set their upper range age much lower. All these combined, pragmatically make it a good choice for men whether they are looking to be an SD or not to use SA. \n\nPersonally im open to being an SD for the right girl, but ive had vanilla a handful of times from seeking as well. \n\nYeah I know its annoying to a lot of sbs for non sds to be on SA, but trust me the guys have a shit ton of annoyances on there as well with all the platonics, pic sellers etc. Just vet and move on.",

Also putting 'I only want a wealthy man' on a regular dating site isn't really going to make you any friends.

Also putting 'I only want a wealthy man' on a regular dating site isn't really going to make you any friends. It'll turn off the 'regulars' and the rich guys among them will probably see it as a red flag.\n\nSo the other reason is that they can be explicit about what they want (even if they have to wade through a bunch of bullshit and scammers to get it)",

The probability is just higher there than on regular dating sites to find a 'richer' guy than most.\n\nOn regular dating sites there is literally no way to determine that, or filter for wealth. Also putting 'I only want a wealthy man' on a regular dating site isn't really going to make you any friends. It'll turn off the 'regulars' and the rich guys among them will probably see it as a red flag.\n\nSo the other reason is that they can be explicit about what they want (even if they have to wade through a bunch of bullshit and scammers to get it)",
