From the neck up it looks great, but a haircut like that really needs to mesh into an overall look. Like, if you were dressed a bit edgier it would probably look great, but the contrast between how meticulously done your hair is and how casual your clothing is is jarring somehow. \n\nSorry if that sounds mean, I think it looks great but I think it could look even better!",

I would suggest you try it because the short, trimmed and edged hair detracts from the whole point of the style you're looking for, I think. My hair isn't long like yours, though, so I can't do the braids. By the way, I'm suit and tie formal at work and casual summer tanks and shorts most everywhere else.",
