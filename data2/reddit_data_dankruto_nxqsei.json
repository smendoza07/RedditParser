                                    "body": "Blame Kishimoto for having planned a Naruto vs Sasuke final battle. He needed to make Sasuke villainous enough for that. Up to point where he joined the alliance I quite loved his character arc. Even when he snapped at the kage summit and started killing samurais who were getting in his way of finding and killing Danzo...I understood why he was like that. The consecutive traumatic experiences he received from Itachi, Orochimaru's curse when he was younger and finally the cruel and unimaginable truth that Tobi revealed to him worsened his mental and emotional state significantly. I'm surprised that he was able to handle all that hatred, anger and depression he received from early on without ever going too far as to kill innocents on a whim. The manipulation that was done to him was also kinda extreme. He still managed to disobey his brother when he instructed him to kill his best friend, outsmart Orochimaru and free the prisoners that he experimented upon, recreate a version of team seven that he came to care for showing us that he never really managed to sever his bonds with them and so on. Even when he learned the truth from Tobi he didn't instantly believe him. His anger towards the leaf stemmed from the fact that they used his brother as an obedient tool to exact their corrupted version of justice which justified his clan's genocide. Still, I don't think he'd target any innocent people first despite what he preached to everyone and to himself. That's why he went to find Danzo first and questioned him about the correct version of events. On top of that he saw Danzo's abomination of an arm that carried his clan's eyes. That was another strong trigger for his sanity. That's why he attacked his former team with the intent to kill(although Sakura was the one who attacked him first both times). Even then he stopped and listened to Naruto's reasoning as to why he doesn't want to give up on him and that he understands the pain and anger he feels after what Konoha has done to him. He was shocked that Naruto felt so strongly for him after everything he did to keep him away. And he agreed to fight him first before attacking everyone else. I believe that he didn't care if he died trying. At least he regained some semblance of sanity and he betrayed Obito and the Akatsuki afterwards. Still, his crimes are not to be justified. But when you think about how many villains got away with much worse and heinous crimes than Sasuke for a longer time...he really wasn't that bad. Plus, his different phases have added a lot of excitement in the series. \nI just can't get behind Kishimoto's last resort to regress his character development further. I mean, I understand the reasoning behind his plan to kill the kages and the jinchurikies and focus all the hatred on him to prevent the nations and villages from going at each others' throats(a plan that resembled Itachi's way of doing things for the peace of Konoha)...but it went against what he took from the previous hokages and his confrontation with Itachi. It all boils down to Kishimoto making the Uchihas a generation originating from a demigod who went evil and attacked everyone and the animosity between the incarnations of Indra and Ashura being destined to clash against each other. Plus Naruto's destiny which entailed him going against a young man with powerful eyes, namely Sasuke. It damaged the series imo and Sasuke wasn't the only one whose quality was reduced. He is still the most interesting who had the most development in my opinion. And he is the highlight of the Boruto series along with Naruto.",

First he only wanted to kill Danzo, then the elders, then he demanded Konoha's destruction and then the Gokage. His thirst for revenge was never satiated and I guess that's the message Kishimoto was trying to convey.\n\nBut I guess before anything else, Naruto was a generic shounen with lots of ouutside interference, meaning fan-service (fights included) >>>>> Plot and themes",

                            "body": "Blame Kishimoto for having planned a Naruto vs Sasuke final battle. He needed to make Sasuke villainous enough for that. Up to point where he joined the alliance I quite loved his character arc. Even when he snapped at the kage summit and started killing samurais who were getting in his way of finding and killing Danzo...I understood why he was like that. The consecutive traumatic experiences he received from Itachi, Orochimaru's curse when he was younger and finally the cruel and unimaginable truth that Tobi revealed to him worsened his mental and emotional state significantly. I'm surprised that he was able to handle all that hatred, anger and depression he received from early on without ever going too far as to kill innocents on a whim. The manipulation that was done to him was also kinda extreme. He still managed to disobey his brother when he instructed him to kill his best friend, outsmart Orochimaru and free the prisoners that he experimented upon, recreate a version of team seven that he came to care for showing us that he never really managed to sever his bonds with them and so on. Even when he learned the truth from Tobi he didn't instantly believe him. His anger towards the leaf stemmed from the fact that they used his brother as an obedient tool to exact their corrupted version of justice which justified his clan's genocide. Still, I don't think he'd target any innocent people first despite what he preached to everyone and to himself. That's why he went to find Danzo first and questioned him about the correct version of events. On top of that he saw Danzo's abomination of an arm that carried his clan's eyes. That was another strong trigger for his sanity. That's why he attacked his former team with the intent to kill(although Sakura was the one who attacked him first both times). Even then he stopped and listened to Naruto's reasoning as to why he doesn't want to give up on him and that he understands the pain and anger he feels after what Konoha has done to him. He was shocked that Naruto felt so strongly for him after everything he did to keep him away. And he agreed to fight him first before attacking everyone else. I believe that he didn't care if he died trying. At least he regained some semblance of sanity and he betrayed Obito and the Akatsuki afterwards. Still, his crimes are not to be justified. But when you think about how many villains got away with much worse and heinous crimes than Sasuke for a longer time...he really wasn't that bad. Plus, his different phases have added a lot of excitement in the series. \nI just can't get behind Kishimoto's last resort to regress his character development further. I mean, I understand the reasoning behind his plan to kill the kages and the jinchurikies and focus all the hatred on him to prevent the nations and villages from going at each others' throats(a plan that resembled Itachi's way of doing things for the peace of Konoha)...but it went against what he took from the previous hokages and his confrontation with Itachi. It all boils down to Kishimoto making the Uchihas a generation originating from a demigod who went evil and attacked everyone and the animosity between the incarnations of Indra and Ashura being destined to clash against each other. Plus Naruto's destiny which entailed him going against a young man with powerful eyes, namely Sasuke. It damaged the series imo and Sasuke wasn't the only one whose quality was reduced. He is still the most interesting who had the most development in my opinion. And he is the highlight of the Boruto series along with Naruto.",

                    "body": "Blame Kishimoto for having planned a Naruto vs Sasuke final battle. He needed to make Sasuke villainous enough for that. Up to point where he joined the alliance I quite loved his character arc. Even when he snapped at the kage summit and started killing samurais who were getting in his way of finding and killing Danzo...I understood why he was like that. The consecutive traumatic experiences he received from Itachi, Orochimaru's curse when he was younger and finally the cruel and unimaginable truth that Tobi revealed to him worsened his mental and emotional state significantly. I'm surprised that he was able to handle all that hatred, anger and depression he received from early on without ever going too far as to kill innocents on a whim. The manipulation that was done to him was also kinda extreme. He still managed to disobey his brother when he instructed him to kill his best friend, outsmart Orochimaru and free the prisoners that he experimented upon, recreate a version of team seven that he came to care for showing us that he never really managed to sever his bonds with them and so on. Even when he learned the truth from Tobi he didn't instantly believe him. His anger towards the leaf stemmed from the fact that they used his brother as an obedient tool to exact their corrupted version of justice which justified his clan's genocide. Still, I don't think he'd target any innocent people first despite what he preached to everyone and to himself. That's why he went to find Danzo first and questioned him about the correct version of events. On top of that he saw Danzo's abomination of an arm that carried his clan's eyes. That was another strong trigger for his sanity. That's why he attacked his former team with the intent to kill(although Sakura was the one who attacked him first both times). Even then he stopped and listened to Naruto's reasoning as to why he doesn't want to give up on him and that he understands the pain and anger he feels after what Konoha has done to him. He was shocked that Naruto felt so strongly for him after everything he did to keep him away. And he agreed to fight him first before attacking everyone else. I believe that he didn't care if he died trying. At least he regained some semblance of sanity and he betrayed Obito and the Akatsuki afterwards. Still, his crimes are not to be justified. But when you think about how many villains got away with much worse and heinous crimes than Sasuke for a longer time...he really wasn't that bad. Plus, his different phases have added a lot of excitement in the series. \nI just can't get behind Kishimoto's last resort to regress his character development further. I mean, I understand the reasoning behind his plan to kill the kages and the jinchurikies and focus all the hatred on him to prevent the nations and villages from going at each others' throats(a plan that resembled Itachi's way of doing things for the peace of Konoha)...but it went against what he took from the previous hokages and his confrontation with Itachi. It all boils down to Kishimoto making the Uchihas a generation originating from a demigod who went evil and attacked everyone and the animosity between the incarnations of Indra and Ashura being destined to clash against each other. Plus Naruto's destiny which entailed him going against a young man with powerful eyes, namely Sasuke. It damaged the series imo and Sasuke wasn't the only one whose quality was reduced. He is still the most interesting who had the most development in my opinion. And he is the highlight of the Boruto series along with Naruto.",

            "body": "Blame Kishimoto for having planned a Naruto vs Sasuke final battle. He needed to make Sasuke villainous enough for that. Up to point where he joined the alliance I quite loved his character arc. Even when he snapped at the kage summit and started killing samurais who were getting in his way of finding and killing Danzo...I understood why he was like that. The consecutive traumatic experiences he received from Itachi, Orochimaru's curse when he was younger and finally the cruel and unimaginable truth that Tobi revealed to him worsened his mental and emotional state significantly. I'm surprised that he was able to handle all that hatred, anger and depression he received from early on without ever going too far as to kill innocents on a whim. The manipulation that was done to him was also kinda extreme. He still managed to disobey his brother when he instructed him to kill his best friend, outsmart Orochimaru and free the prisoners that he experimented upon, recreate a version of team seven that he came to care for showing us that he never really managed to sever his bonds with them and so on. Even when he learned the truth from Tobi he didn't instantly believe him. His anger towards the leaf stemmed from the fact that they used his brother as an obedient tool to exact their corrupted version of justice which justified his clan's genocide. Still, I don't think he'd target any innocent people first despite what he preached to everyone and to himself. That's why he went to find Danzo first and questioned him about the correct version of events. On top of that he saw Danzo's abomination of an arm that carried his clan's eyes. That was another strong trigger for his sanity. That's why he attacked his former team with the intent to kill(although Sakura was the one who attacked him first both times). Even then he stopped and listened to Naruto's reasoning as to why he doesn't want to give up on him and that he understands the pain and anger he feels after what Konoha has done to him. He was shocked that Naruto felt so strongly for him after everything he did to keep him away. And he agreed to fight him first before attacking everyone else.
