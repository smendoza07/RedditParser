    "body": "I have been avoiding SLF the past few weeks because...well, just like everywhere else, shit got dark. I don't have a lot of space in my heart right now for posts about how women who have literally given their bodies, time, attention, love and energy to their partners are no longer deserving humans. (Not speaking for everyone's experience, just for my own and what I've read.) I wanted to take a moment to post something positive.\n\nI have been seeing my sugar partner for several years - we regularly go long periods without seeing each other, we can easily go a week without texting/speaking, and we live our lives separately. He is also one of my favourite humans, and I deeply value his presence in my life beyond the help he gives me.\n\nIt has now been almost 2 months since we've seen each other. He is battling to keep his business afloat, and he is in an at-risk group for COVID.\n\nLast month he sent me a % of my usual allowance, citing cash flow issues with his business. I thanked him and said I understood and not to worry - I was genuinely grateful for whatever he could give.\n\nToday I have seen that he sent the rest of it. He didn't even say anything to me about it; he just did it. When I saw it I started crying. While we have a strong connection a part of me has always wondered what it meant to him - if I was just entertaining company, good sex and a dinner date/travel companion, or if he actually cared about my well-being. I have worked to keep my own feelings in check - there are boundaries to our relationship, and for good reasons - but I really do adore him, and have always joked that when the apocalypse came I'd want to spend it with him (truth). I do not have many people in the world looking out for me, and he knows that; his presence in my life these past few years has helped make me feel safe.\n\nI don't know if he will send me my allowance next month. I don't know when we will next see each other. I don't know if my vanilla work will fold because of COVID, or if his business will survive it; I don't know if I'll have to move country once lockdown ends because I can no longer afford rent in my home city. I don't know if our SR will survive with us both in self-isolation in different places. Like many millions of people the world over, I have a lot of worrisome questions in my head. But the question of whether he actually cares about me is no longer one of them.\n\nFor everyone reading this who is like him: **Thank you.** Thank you for remembering that we are human; thank you for remembering that many people right now (in many different ways) are struggling. Thank you for giving when you didn't have to; thank you for being generous at the very moment when it is hard for you to do so. The character you show during this period will not be forgotten by those lucky enough to know you.\n\nFor the women (and men) reading this who are struggling - I see you. I know that (for now at least) I have been lucky. Thinking about everyone and wishing you and yours well.\n\nx",

Whereas a lot of men in the bowl are simply looking for emotional attention (my phone is a blowing up with POTs wanting to talk and text endlessly right now) - hence my comment about emotional labour. I have no shortage of POTs who are happy to never have sex and simply have me listen to them, which is essentially asking me to be an unpaid therapist.",

We see a thread put up designed to shame and insult people who have stepped up to support these young women in such a terrible time.   And that thread has all kinds of upvotes.\n\nSeriously, WTF is wrong with people who cannot see the asymmetry happening here?  On one side you have young (and other) people experiencing a full-on crises, and on the other side SD\u2019s experiencing financial pain, but for anyone sugaring in first place, pain that can be dealt with and overcome.   Why are so many here so god damn jaded and tone deaf?   Makes me sick.\n\nSigned - a white knight simp.",

The  character you show during this period will not be forgotten by those  lucky enough to know you.\n\nI think as with all relationships, this is a two-way street.  Thanks to SBs who don't think in terms of \"payments\" (funny, I noticed you did not mention this term once in your post), or insist sugaring is a job, and instead partner with us to build a sugar *relationship* that far surpasses any exchange of support and intimacy.  You're the SBs who make it an easy decision -- hell, a no-brainer -- to continue supporting you, to the extent our financial situations make that viable.  You're awesome!  We're just trying to keep up :)\n\nThere's no right or wrong, everyone's choice as to how NSA or emotionally intimate they want their SR to be.  But payment thinking begets paper-thin commitment, both ways.  Two way emotional intimacy, connection, generosity, appreciation, beget something that can outlast little (and sometimes big) bumps in the road.",

That's just the reality. If you are a cynic then you immediately ask, \"what's in it for me?\" If you have faith that some people are just decent people then you help where you can. I don't blame the cynical SDs. I also applaud the SDs with faith in humanity. To the cynical SDs, getting \"burned\" for a few isn't worth the burden. Have faith! Be careful and responsible.

People will come on here with stories about how their sd ditched them, but we are only hearing one side. How long was the SR? 1 month? 2? How was their connection? Not very close? Always arguing? Maybe they were close to splitting anyway and now that they cant meet, its over.   We truly dont know what these SRs entail , im very sure none if it is black and white like we hear.  Id like to think that if an sd could, he would help his sb when times get tough. If i had a year+ sb that i cared about, id try to be a white knight. The truth is, a lot of businesses are not going to make it through this, and alot of sds just dont have the cash to give. Its not trying to be a bad person or uncaring, but you cant squeeze something out if its not there to begin with lol. Im happy you have a great sd.",

That said, if someone who works for me stops doing their job, I will still like and value them as a person, but I'm not paying them for a service they're no longer performing -- getting paid without doing their job is not a part of our relationship, no matter how much I like them.  Sugar relationships aren't jobs, my SB is not my employee or service provider, and an SR can be a complex mix of things, but as I've said elsewhere, one of my measures for \"how great is my SR\" is: does allowance feel like an obligation/liability?  It's the genuine connection that makes it something I like doing for her.",
