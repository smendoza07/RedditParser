    "body": "Roughly two years ago I met my PT sugar baby.  She works at one of those little drive through coffee shacks that I go to nearly every morning.   I overtipped and hit on her for over a year before she gave me a chance.  She\u2019s the cutest little 22 yo 5\u20192 105 lb inked biker babe with an angelic face.  She said she liked me but has some hang ups about taking money in a transactional way but said she would be my SB if I would buy her a motorcycle for her birthday that was 10 months away.   I laughed and said she wasn\u2019t going to see me for 10 months without accepting money or anything,  that\u2019s not how this stuff works.  She smiled and said she sees me every morning and knows I wouldn\u2019t leave her hanging.   She kind of restored my faith in young ladies after being burned a few times.  Today was her birthday and at 10am she rode off the lot grinning from ear to ear on her brand new matte black Harley Davidson Iron 883.  I\u2019ve been grinning all day and needed to share it with someone that might understand.",
