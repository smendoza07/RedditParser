I'd probably do once every 3-4 days, and even then less than a dime-size. Massage in with your fingers, in a motion like a scalp massage. Otherwise, just rinse with warm (not hot) water and condition as needed. Your natural hair oils (sebum) will coat your hair and prevent it from drying out, and as an added bonus your hair will gain some sheen and a great deal more color as a result. \n\nIs... your hat uncomfortable when you wear it? I only wear hats when I run, hike, or am involved in 1950s detective work, but I don't remember ever having red marks from it.",

This week, use like 20% less shampoo every day, and work it in a little longer. Next week, only use about 50% of what you use now. The following week, go to every other day. The following week, shampoo maybe twice a week, and only with a dime-sized amount (at least based on average shorter men's hair; use more shampoo for longer hair). Condition every day. \n\nOne of the issues is that shampoo isn't something to which we're adapted. Random mutation and natural selection played a significant part in the development of sebaceous glands, which produce skin and scalp oil as a layer to both keep skin and hair from drying out and to create a slightly less habitable environment for bacteria. If we look a cultures which, today, use no shampoo or detergents in their hair, we don't see especially oily hair because their scalp hasn't had to ramp up production to deal with the fact they're removing a lot of oil every single day. \n\nYou are likely producing a great deal more sebum than you would need if you didn't shampoo every day. Overproduction can lead to clogs. If you reduce your use of shampoo over time, while you may have a slightly more oily transition period (which can be mitigated almost entirely by rinsing daily with shampoo and conditioning), eventually your oil production should reduce. I also don't use styling products anymore, aside from the very occasional use of the perhaps odd choice of Aveno hand lotion for very light hold. I know it's weird, but it works, it smells like basically nothing, and my scalp seems to appreciate it. \n\nI did this myself some years ago, and the result (well, the correlation) was my dandruff stopped and never returned, my hair stopped being fuzzy looking and dry, my face became a little less oily, and my wavy hair started to finally behave. \n\nYou don't have to do any of this, but if you're up for an experiment and you're curious, it's something to try. Remember that everyone is different, though, so try to be patient and objective about the results.",

However, I also understand how annoying long hair can be to upkeep, and going into college is a good time to keep your life simple. If you want to keep it short, rock it with confidence because this looks good too. I don't know what kind of persona you want to put out, but the shorter hair also has a little bit more of a \"bad boy\" feel lol. \n\nIt also gives you a good opportunity to try different things with it as it grows back out.\n\nThe one thing I would avoid is styling your hair the way it was on your rate me post. When it's that long and pushed straight up it elongates your head, and also has a little bit of an \"MTV's Jersey Shore\" vibe going on. If you want to style it like that, I would keep the length a little shorter.",

This week, use like 20% less shampoo every day, and work it in a little longer. Next week, only use about 50% of what you use now. The following week, go to every other day. The following week, shampoo maybe twice a week, and only with a dime-sized amount (at least based on average shorter men's hair; use more shampoo for longer hair). Condition every day. \n\nOne of the issues is that shampoo isn't something to which we're adapted. Random mutation and natural selection played a significant part in the development of sebaceous glands, which produce skin and scalp oil as a layer to both keep skin and hair from drying out and to create a slightly less habitable environment for bacteria. If we look a cultures which, today, use no shampoo or detergents in their hair, we don't see especially oily hair because their scalp hasn't had to ramp up production to deal with the fact they're removing a lot of oil every single day. \n\nYou are likely producing a great deal more sebum than you would need if you didn't shampoo every day. Overproduction can lead to clogs. If you reduce your use of shampoo over time, while you may have a slightly more oily transition period (which can be mitigated almost entirely by rinsing daily with shampoo and conditioning), eventually your oil production should reduce. I also don't use styling products anymore, aside from the very occasional use of the perhaps odd choice of Aveno hand lotion for very light hold. I know it's weird, but it works, it smells like basically nothing, and my scalp seems to appreciate it. \n\nI did this myself some years ago, and the result (well, the correlation) was my dandruff stopped and never returned, my hair stopped being fuzzy looking and dry, my face became a little less oily, and my wavy hair started to finally behave. \n\nYou don't have to do any of this, but if you're up for an experiment and you're curious, it's something to try. Remember that everyone is different, though, so try to be patient and objective about the results.",

            "body": "I wouldn't recommend going cold turkey, so to speak, but you could pretty easily transition. This week, use like 20% less shampoo every day, and work it in a little longer. Next week, only use about 50% of what you use now. The following week, go to every other day. The following week, shampoo maybe twice a week, and only with a dime-sized amount (at least based on average shorter men's hair; use more shampoo for longer hair). Condition every day. \n\nOne of the issues is that shampoo isn't something to which we're adapted. Random mutation and natural selection played a significant part in the development of sebaceous glands, which produce skin and scalp oil as a layer to both keep skin and hair from drying out and to create a slightly less habitable environment for bacteria. If we look a cultures which, today, use no shampoo or detergents in their hair, we don't see especially oily hair because their scalp hasn't had to ramp up production to deal with the fact they're removing a lot of oil every single day. \n\nYou are likely producing a great deal more sebum than you would need if you didn't shampoo every day. Overproduction can lead to clogs. If you reduce your use of shampoo over time, while you may have a slightly more oily transition period (which can be mitigated almost entirely by rinsing daily with shampoo and conditioning), eventually your oil production should reduce. I also don't use styling products anymore, aside from the very occasional use of the perhaps odd choice of Aveno hand lotion for very light hold. I know it's weird, but it works, it smells like basically nothing, and my scalp seems to appreciate it. \n\nI did this myself some years ago, and the result (well, the correlation) was my dandruff stopped and never returned, my hair stopped being fuzzy looking and dry, my face became a little less oily, and my wavy hair started to finally behave. \n\nYou don't have to do any of this, but if you're up for an experiment and you're curious, it's something to try. Remember that everyone is different, though, so try to be patient and objective about the results.",
