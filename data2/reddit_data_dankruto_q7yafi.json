Did you try to reorganize your stuff immediately after being born or was it taught to you by your parents lol?\n\nAnd as a kid with no supervision why would he eat something else other than ramen which he liked. You can talk about nutrients but real life kids with parents don't eat everything that is put in front of them, so what do you expect out of an orphan?",

If your other vital organs get hit though, you'll die but slower. Other than that the blood loss will take you but since they left them in Zabuza, he must have bled out slower.\n\nAnd remember they did kill him.",

Did you try to reorganize your stuff immediately after being born or was it taught to you by your parents lol?\n\nAnd as a kid with no supervision why would he eat something else other than ramen which he liked. You can talk about nutrients but real life kids with parents don't eat everything that is put in front of them, so what do you expect out of an orphan?",

Did you try to reorganize your stuff immediately after being born or was it taught to you by your parents lol?\n\nAnd as a kid with no supervision why would he eat something else other than ramen which he liked.

Kakashi literally said that, demonstrating his Chidori to Naruto. And to Sasuke, he said the chidori he used on Naruto at the hospital was not the size you aim at a comrade.\n\nAs for blades Zabuza got hit with, the only explanation is that they didn't hit his heart or major arteries. If your other vital organs get hit though, you'll die but slower. Other than that the blood loss will take you but since they left them in Zabuza, he must have bled out slower.\n\nAnd remember they did kill him.",
