Yoo Jae Suk adventure and struggle with a wild and rowdy female celebrity cast: Jeon So Min, Jessi, Oh NaRa, and Lovelyz's Lee MiJoo.\n\nIt's still unclear what the exact format of the program. Yet the first teaser, show the 5 cast members meeting up for their first meal together to discuss various things, but soon, the ladies conversation turn into some serious \"girl talk\". When they even get into the topic of breast implants, MC Yoo Jae Suk takes that as his cue to plug his ears up, expressing his \"discomfort\".\n\nThis may be YJS biggest challenge in his career. Can he manage to lead the one of a kind cast??? \n\n9PM KST \u2764\ufe0f",
