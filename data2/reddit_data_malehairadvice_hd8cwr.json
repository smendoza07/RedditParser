And I\u2019m not picky with what shampoo and conditioner I use but I always make sure its mostly natural ingredients, so anything branded as \u201call natural\u201d. Finally when my hair is damp I spray my hair with Brickell Men\u2019s Texturizing Sea Salt Spray because it\u2019s all natural and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t dry out your hair like other sea salt sprays it has all these minerals and vitamins that strengthen your hair and moisture it, you can buy it on amazon for like $20 and it last like a month. I do 2 sprays of it on the left side of my head then right then back then top then front and then just let it air dry. DONE!",

Finally when my hair is damp I spray my hair with Brickell Men\u2019s Texturizing Sea Salt Spray because it\u2019s all natural and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t dry out your hair like other sea salt sprays it has all these minerals and vitamins that strengthen your hair and moisture it, you can buy it on amazon for like $20 and it last like a month. I do 2 sprays of it on the left side of my head then right then back then top then front and then just let it air dry. DONE!",
