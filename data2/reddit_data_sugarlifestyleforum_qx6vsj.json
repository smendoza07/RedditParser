Before leaving this morning he not only checked my oil, but he also taught me how to check my oil so now I can do it myself. \n\nIn my head I'm thinking \"I love that he took the time to teach me this\" and instead of saying thank you like a normal person I told him I loved him. I honestly don't know who was more shocked. He laughed and I jumped in my car as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm still embarrassed almost 12 hours later \ud83d\ude2d",

            "body": "I once told a SB as I was leaving, \"Luv ya\" with a hug and kiss. I then stopped and spent what felt like a long, stammering 10 minutes, but probably it was 30 seconds, trying to explain I wasn't in love with her, it just came out that way.\n\nShe smiled and kissed me. After that we often greeted each other or said goodbye with \"luv ya.\" Felt nice and we saw each other on and off for over 4 years. She was living with her bf most of that time and I am still with my wife, so the boundaries were quite clear.\n\nDon't feel ashamed. He did something caring and it made you feel loved. You expressed it openly and honestly. I'm sure he's fine with that. If you want proof of that just ask him on your next date if he wants to talk about it. If he's a real sweetie he'll say no, smile and give you a kiss. In any event it's nice to hear someone you like say they love you. Yeah, it can be a little scary, too, but that's okay.",

He should be fine. \n\nI'm sure it could probably even be flattering, since I think a lot of men feel insecure that they're only getting your company for money and support.
