I have no idea who any of these guys are (didn't know Manny either \ud83d\ude01 I'm a girl, leave me alone!), but it's always funny to see KJK fangirling. \n\nCan they make this into a theme though? Invite guests related to what the cast like. Some ideas: \n\n- YJS loves noodles & YSC loves cooking, so invite a chef \n- JSJ loves investing, so invite an investor (YouTuber maybe?) \n- Haha loves fashion, invite models (JWJ doesn't count \ud83d\ude02) \n- SJH loves drinking, invite wine makers or go to a winery (is that inappropriate for 15 rating? \ud83e\udd14) \n- JSM loves romance, invite the married one's loved ones and hot idols for JSM \ud83d\ude01 or she loves dancing and music, do an episode of them learning a dance or debuting as a fake idol group\n\nEdit: Or turn this upside down and do episodes the members hate.  \ud83d\ude01 \n\n- YJS hates seeing SoMin happy, the entire episode he should make her happy \ud83d\ude02\n- JSJ hates when they're nice to him, the entire episode they should be nice to him. \n- KJK hates lovelines, BRING ALL THE WOMEN he's ever had lovelines on the show to pick the ultimate loveline (I hate it too. \ud83d\ude02) \n- Haha hates when JSM is on his team and has to play a sport while he watches \ud83d\ude01 \n- JSM hates when they make her a referee; give her referee classes \n- YSC hates losing and being chosen for the penalty by the guest, make him their #1 target \ud83d\ude02 \n\nPoor these guys. I'm so mean. But the PDs are even meaner so I'm sure they can come up with much worse things. I don't know what SJH hates so didn't write anything.",

I have no idea who any of these guys are (didn't know Manny either \ud83d\ude01 I'm a girl, leave me alone!), but it's always funny to see KJK fangirling. \n\nCan they make this into a theme though? Invite guests related to what the cast like. Some ideas: \n\n- YJS loves noodles & YSC loves cooking, so invite a chef \n- JSJ loves investing, so invite an investor (YouTuber maybe?) \n- Haha loves fashion, invite models (JWJ doesn't count \ud83d\ude02) \n- SJH loves drinking, invite wine makers or go to a winery (is that inappropriate for 15 rating? \ud83e\udd14) \n- JSM loves romance, invite the married one's loved ones and hot idols for JSM \ud83d\ude01 or she loves dancing and music, do an episode of them learning a dance or debuting as a fake idol group\n\nEdit: Or turn this upside down and do episodes the members hate.  \ud83d\ude01 \n\n- YJS hates seeing SoMin happy, the entire episode he should make her happy \ud83d\ude02\n- JSJ hates when they're nice to him, the entire episode they should be nice to him. \n- KJK hates lovelines, BRING ALL THE WOMEN he's ever had lovelines on the show to pick the ultimate loveline (I hate it too. \ud83d\ude02) \n- Haha hates when JSM is on his team and has to play a sport while he watches \ud83d\ude01 \n- JSM hates when they make her a referee; give her referee classes \n- YSC hates losing and being chosen for the penalty by the guest, make him their #1 target \ud83d\ude02 \n\nPoor these guys. I'm so mean. But the PDs are even meaner so I'm sure they can come up with much worse things. I don't know what SJH hates so didn't write anything.",
