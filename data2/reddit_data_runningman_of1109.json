    "body": "This week SBS's Running Man which first aired in 2010, will set a tie record for the longest domestic variety show as it celebrates its 563th episode. MBC's Infinity Challenge first aired in 2006, had been on the \"national entertainment list\" throughout its airing, and ended its 13 year run in 2018 with 563 episodes.\n\nIf Running Man, hosted by national MC Yoo Jae-suk airs just two more times, it will set a record for the longest-running variety show in Korea surpassing Infinity Challenge. In particular, the record will be unique to Yoo Jae Suk.\u00a0\n\nInfinity Challenge unfortunately ended, but Running Man will continue to run and meet viewers. Recently, main member Lee Kwang Soo left for health reasons, but the production team has made it clear for the time being there will be 7 members without any member changes. As for the chemistry between the members is getting better day by day, viewers are looking forward to how far Running Man will write history.\n\n[https://www.insight.co.kr/news/347224](https://www.insight.co.kr/news/347224)\n\n[https://www.wikitree.co.kr/articles/666461](https://www.wikitree.co.kr/articles/666461)\n\nTo clarify this is based on # of eps not years, & for variety not talk show. A rare accomplishment.",
