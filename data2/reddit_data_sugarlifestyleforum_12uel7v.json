    "body": "So I've been in the bowl for roughly 6months, and finally found someone I feel is worth writing about...\n\nTL:DR.. SB is into body painting\n\n23yo college student studying art + literature...  At first I was thinking she'd be another escort wanting to be an SB because within the first few messages she mentioned she was a dom and kinky.  In my short time most of those have led to be escorts...  Well, I gave her a chance and man I'm happy I did...\n\nMet up with her while she was visiting her parents for a M&G, and what was supposed to be 20-30min for coffee turned into \"Oh crap, we've been here 3hrs, I have to go do x and x...\".  We had been so engrossed in convo hat both of us lost track of time.  No talk about $$, very little talk of the arrangement, it was like I was on a vanilla date it seemed so organic (we eventually discussed arrangements after the m&g).\n\nFast forward a week, I go visit her at her school (1.5hr drive) and get a hotel a couple towns away at her request.  Met up with her, had a couple drinks, then she asks if I can take her back to her dorm because she forgot some \"supplies\"..  This kinda raised a flag for me, as I had come a ways to see her.  But I was feeling good, and decided the risk was minimal...  After 15min I figure she lost interest and ditched me but I figured I'd wait a bit longer..  She comes out of her dorm with 2 backpacks and a large 4ft roll of paper.  Her idea of a fun evening was body painting (art student)!\n\nI never thought I would have a more enjoyable evening by laying on the hotel bathroom floor while we painted each other.  I haven't laughed and felt like that since I was a teenager... I got sent a bill by the hotel for new sheets (well worth it), and now I have some tasteful art to hang on my wall to remember the night.  \n\nWhen I went to give her her PPM she had a look on her face like she forgot.  This is bad.... I could fall for a girl like this fairly easily...",
