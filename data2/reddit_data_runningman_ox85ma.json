We will thoroughly comply with the authorities' quarantine guidelines, and we will do our best in our future activities.\"\n\nAccordingly, SBS 'Running Man', in which Yoo Jae-suk is appearing on a regular basis, is also scheduled to be recorded on the 9th, and Yoo Jae-suk will also participate.\n\nIn addition, 'Running Man' is scheduled to broadcast normally from this week on broadcasts that were canceled due to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n[https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&aid=0001191713](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&aid=0001191713)\n\n[https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=052&aid=0001622627](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=052&aid=0001622627)\n\nEdit: Translation Errors & Added [Soompi Article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1482135wpp/yoo-jae-suk-announces-return-to-activities-after-testing-negative-for-covid-19)",
