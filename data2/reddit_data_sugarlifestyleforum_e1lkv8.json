    "body": "So I just got back from a lunch M&G. More of a blue collar type guy. Self-made. Definitely successful. We start sharing stories about annoying dogs. He mentions that he once had a neighbor who had a large dog that they kept outside, so it barked a lot. \n\nHe then proceeds to tell me how he solved the problem. He went over in the middle of the night, through the woods, to his neighbors house. Broke into the fenced-in area, KIDNAPPED the dog (!), put the dog in his car, drove to a town several towns over and let the dog go!! He said he never heard the dog barking again...\n\nI feel like a real serial killer wouldn't share that story, because they wouldn't want you to know they're a serial killer. But still. \n\nThe search for a decent SD continues...",
