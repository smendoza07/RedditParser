But Naruto betrayed his \" I never go back on my wordy \" and send a shadow clone instead ruining the celebration when the clone popped. And also he is 12 when he will be 17 like Naruto was in War arc,  he would also lose his whole village and the people he love.",

                            "body": "For me personally, Boruto's character was designed to be hated. Whether it was intentional or not, a cocky kid who flips between \"I'm the best, fuck you bitches\" and \"Wahhh my dad is too busy my life sucks\" is too obnoxious to care about when he dad experienced first hand the horrors of war and kill or be killed combat.\n\nObviously they are two different stories, we need to appreciate who and what Boruto is. If Boruto was it's own separate anime? Sure I wouldn't have had any issues with it, but it's a sequel to Naruto, you can't NOT compare some kid with a loving family whining about his dad being busy when his dad never had a family and was shunned and hated by 99% of his village.\n\nIdk what Boruto is up to now after the chakra stealing people, I watched clips of the time travel on YT, maybe the anime got way better and it'll be a classic in a decade, but I personally think it's a bit stupid to say you can't compare the two, if you want your audience to feel sorry for your main character, to empathize with them, don't have an entire series beforehand show his father going through even worse things at a younger age. \"Worse problems elsewhere don't invalidate your problems\" doesn't really apply to anime imo.",

And i understand how boruto would be compared to naruto. But, look at it from borutos perspective, he has a father whos the hokage, and doesn't visit his sisters birthday, which he valued more than his own. And also..i think you are a bit behind. Catch up in the anime. Boruto has already apologized to his father about how he didn't care about the load his father had, and naruto the same. He also has stopped saying how he hates his father. Also this is the perfect time to catch up..the new arc is one if the best, so thats your cue. And also remember, we have only seen the start of boruto. Theres so much more to come. And who knows, maybe boruto has a sad ending. No big spoilers, but momoshiki does say that boruto will lose everything. It feels to me that boruto has everything and will at the end have nothing. Nothings confirmed ofcourse. But this will definitely show how boruto has to cope through everything that he will lose. Thanks for ur opinion.",

Besides the people in the room with Amado and Boruto and Kawaki because if there obvious ties. Where Sarada doesn\u2019t have that immediate connection.

And he hasn't even spoken a word to sarada and sakura, and he'd die? It would be too rushed and forced. Besides he needs to train her and boruto. I don't think he'll die right now\n\n>>. I just as you hope her time comes again in the manga to show her stuff.

Boruto literally thinks about giving up as a Shinobi and resorts to cheating because he realizes he isn\u2019t the best just because he is naturally gifted. And the whole upset about dad stuff is mostly over after Boruto acknowledges the weight his dad carried after the momoshiki arc. I also hate the argument that people make that in order for a character to be good they have to have some tragic backstory like that simply is not true. Boruto has developed so much over the show and through the Manga and I am excited to see where he continues he has shown far more character development than Naruto ever did. And I love Naruto just to be clear but in terms of development it isn\u2019t even close Naruto is a very one note character.",

Maybe he gets a redemption arc. Not all main characters are good, perfect or likeable. Some take their time for their charecter to develop. Also boruto is gonna be a huge-ass story. Like im talking many years. So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

Naruto kept his word and still celebrated his kids birthdays to make up for how busy he was. \n\nHimawari, Shikadai and Sarada are better characters than Boruto ever will be.

Boruto does that because he haven't seen Naruto doing work and doesn't knew about how hard it is but we are talking about Naruto here. Naruto' s whole character was that he never go back on his words but Naruto broke his promise . The things you told about you and your family doesn't apply to Naruto cus any real human have limits . But he was shown making thousands of shadow clones during Chunin exams and fighting for whole day without being tired and during war arc he made thousands of shadow clones and found for days with only KCM-1 mode and after that he got KCM-2 which was a huge power boost and also sage of six paths chakra . So making thousands of clones and even doing all the work alone should not be a big problem for a person who can take on the whole Shinobi alliance by himself and still win. They gave us a lot of bull crap in the first half just to move the plot. Only for one night he can just leave his shadow clones to work and enjoy a night with his family. But even so after momoshiki arc both of them apologied to each other for not understanding and now he doesn't say anything like that . He have grown much.

This wouldn't drain him and would let him get through tedious paperwork quicker while at least allowing him some family time. Even if you think that's still too draining, that's just your opinion and not the actual reason given: some strange sense of respect where clones can't be assistants for paperwork in the Hokage office.\n\nI'm not denying Boruto isn't a poorly written character, but the whole reason between his strained relationship with his dad is just dumb.

That's the difference between Minato, who himself didn't really want to become the hokage, but was chosen because of his skill, and Naruto WHOSE prolly most defining trait other than bringing Sasuke back was to become the hokage. So obviously he places more importance to his duty to the village than the duty to his wife and son. Only difference is that Himawari and Hinata just don't complain and keep their mouth shut whilst being sad on the inside. I mean it's the time of peace, he should be gangbangin Hinata all the time.  I mean, under his rule Konoha sure has developed a lot, but that makes him the greatest Hokage, not the greatest dad. Just because he suffered in family department doesn't mean he has to make others suffer.",

After that he became Hokage and had clones take care of them. He became a father to a village, he doesn't have time or cater to his kids and that is reasonable. I have had a similar living condition. My mum would look after me for a good 8 years and then I took care of my sister. I understood everything. Boruto is a garbage character, nothing more. If he is worn out and he creates clones then that would affect his clones. Being mentally drained is much more different than being physically tired.

He only faced naruto at the age of 12, four years and nothing changed. And he only did that after he witnessed himawari circled her birthday on calendar, hoping naruto will remember. \n\nEven naruto himself knows what he did is wrong. Constantly refusing shikamaru's offers to go home isn't the wisest thing to do. I mean, why did he change now if he didn't think he was wrong? Look at him now, he accepted shikamaru's offers and managed to balance both work and family.",

After that he became Hokage and had clones take care of them. He became a father to a village, he doesn't have time or cater to his kids and that is reasonable. I have had a similar living condition. My mum would look after me for a good 8 years and then I took care of my sister. I understood everything. Boruto is a garbage character, nothing more. If he is worn out and he creates clones then that would affect his clones. Being mentally drained is much more different than being physically tired. His physical capabilities are clearly much better than his mental.\n\nBoruto's problems are only just him. Sarada, Shikadai, Himawari are tons better than he is.",

Does little himawari really need to be worrying about whether her father cares more about her than his work? How much does she know about shadow clones at this point anyway? Does she know that all experiences are retained or could she even comprehend that concept at that age? Whatever way you paint it, it\u2019s really shitty for naruto to send a shadowclone to his daughter\u2019s birthday and then let it pop prematurely despite the fact that a less experienced naruto defeated the third raikage easily using a shadow clone with his weakest transformation.",

There's a difference.\n\nThat being said, I think Boruto acts exactly as he is supposed to given the circumstances. He doesn't know what his father went through. He only knows his father as the leader of the village who's mostly too preoccupied with his duties to take care of his children. People who consider him a brat should watch the time slip arc and his change after that, and then judge Boruto.\n\nEdit: I still can't get how a Genin can have 3 Nature Transformations!!!Who would have thought Naruto's kid would be a prodigy!",

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants.

I mean, if you don't like him it's fine, everyone has their own preferences but at least do your research and make sure you know what you're talking about. \nThe reason boruto's mad at naruto is made very clear. He literally witnessed himawari circled the date of her birthday on a calendar, hoping naruto will notice and remember it. Boruto even said he didn't care if naruto missed his birthday but himawari is still a kid, she needs naruto. He knows it hurts when naruto didn't come to his birthday, that's why he didn't want himawari to feel the same. It hurts because he loves naruto and he misses him. No one will feel hurt if that person means nothing to them.",

But even when he HAS chances for his father's attention, like on Parent-Child Day, he acts like his Dad is a dick and like he doesn't care, totally passes on the opportunity. Or like the ep where they go to ramen together, he mostly acts like he doesn't want anything to do with his Dad and still acts bratty.\n\nIDK, man, all I'm saying is, the way he went about it was wrong, and he should have known that, should have known that it would have the opposite effect from what he wanted. He's smart enough to know that. ESPECIALLY using it against his BEST FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD. Like, what did he expect would happen? What did he think would happen afterward when he couldn't replicate his win without the tool or when the Ninja Tools guy exposed him on his own to glorify his product? I'm not saying he needs to make the right choices the first time because how would he learn, but he still should have known better on his OWN. Besides, even if he still didn't, even if he still made this mistake, it was the way he HANDLED IT that, in my opinion, showed his true colors. They always say it's how you handle things, and he shoved all the blame on Naruto, who may be PARTIALLY at fault, but certainly not totally. If anything, I feel like it digs Boruto's grave as a character even more.\n\nI just feel like after 65+ eps and the MAIN CHARACTER is still pulling this same shit (I would understand it more from a side character - or at least for the MC to understand his mistake and not blame everyone else/try to make up for it better/sooner) and is STILL this unlikable and unsympathetic? I can't really stand by that. If NARUTO were that much of a cheating baby in the OG show, we'd all be saying the same thing, but because it's Boruto, seems like the Boruto fans want to make excuses. Doesn't really seem fair.",

(I\u2019ve had that phase lol)\n\nI mean that whole character arc is what makes him one of my favorite characters in the whole story, I think it\u2019s unique for a character to be shown making and then learning from his mistakes. I think it\u2019s a good way for him to get motivated to be stronger as a kid without having his family murdered or being the nine tails if that makes sense",

Whether it was intentional or not, a cocky kid who flips between \"I'm the best, fuck you bitches\" and \"Wahhh my dad is too busy my life sucks\" is too obnoxious to care about when he dad experienced first hand the horrors of war and kill or be killed combat.\n\nObviously they are two different stories, we need to appreciate who and what Boruto is. If Boruto was it's own separate anime? Sure I wouldn't have had any issues with it, but it's a sequel to Naruto, you can't NOT compare some kid with a loving family whining about his dad being busy when his dad never had a family and was shunned and hated by 99% of his village.\n\nIdk what Boruto is up to now after the chakra stealing people, I watched clips of the time travel on YT, maybe the anime got way better and it'll be a classic in a decade, but I personally think it's a bit stupid to say you can't compare the two, if you want your audience to feel sorry for your main character, to empathize with them, don't have an entire series beforehand show his father going through even worse things at a younger age. \"Worse problems elsewhere don't invalidate your problems\" doesn't really apply to anime imo.",

And i understand how boruto would be compared to naruto. But, look at it from borutos perspective, he has a father whos the hokage, and doesn't visit his sisters birthday, which he valued more than his own. And also..i think you are a bit behind. Catch up in the anime. Boruto has already apologized to his father about how he didn't care about the load his father had, and naruto the same. He also has stopped saying how he hates his father. Also this is the perfect time to catch up..the new arc is one if the best, so thats your cue. And also remember, we have only seen the start of boruto. Theres so much more to come. And who knows, maybe boruto has a sad ending. No big spoilers, but momoshiki does say that boruto will lose everything. It feels to me that boruto has everything and will at the end have nothing. Nothings confirmed ofcourse. But this will definitely show how boruto has to cope through everything that he will lose. Thanks for ur opinion.",

Boruto literally thinks about giving up as a Shinobi and resorts to cheating because he realizes he isn\u2019t the best just because he is naturally gifted. And the whole upset about dad stuff is mostly over after Boruto acknowledges the weight his dad carried after the momoshiki arc. I also hate the argument that people make that in order for a character to be good they have to have some tragic backstory like that simply is not true. Boruto has developed so much over the show and through the Manga and I am excited to see where he continues he has shown far more character development than Naruto ever did. And I love Naruto just to be clear but in terms of development it isn\u2019t even close Naruto is a very one note character.",

Maybe he gets a redemption arc. Not all main characters are good, perfect or likeable. Some take their time for their charecter to develop. Also boruto is gonna be a huge-ass story. Like im talking many years. So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

When he became the Hokage he became the father to an entire village. He is more busy than all the other Hokage's because he is working to keep the peace. Naruto kept his word and still celebrated his kids birthdays to make up for how busy he was. \n\nHimawari, Shikadai and Sarada are better characters than Boruto ever will be. Boruto is a garbage character. Heck, it took a good 60+ episodes for Boruto to not be a spoiled brat.",

Boruto does that because he haven't seen Naruto doing work and doesn't knew about how hard it is but we are talking about Naruto here. Naruto' s whole character was that he never go back on his words but Naruto broke his promise . The things you told about you and your family doesn't apply to Naruto cus any real human have limits . But he was shown making thousands of shadow clones during Chunin exams and fighting for whole day without being tired and during war arc he made thousands of shadow clones and found for days with only KCM-1 mode and after that he got KCM-2 which was a huge power boost and also sage of six paths chakra . So making thousands of clones and even doing all the work alone should not be a big problem for a person who can take on the whole Shinobi alliance by himself and still win. They gave us a lot of bull crap in the first half just to move the plot. Only for one night he can just leave his shadow clones to work and enjoy a night with his family. But even so after momoshiki arc both of them apologied to each other for not understanding and now he doesn't say anything like that . He have grown much. Now he just want to be a person who can protect The Hokage.",

Hiruzen made like countless terrible decisions without using a single clone. Who gives a shit? At the very least, just have the clones read everything and dispel them to approve or reject stuff. \n\nIt's just lazy writing to me as it comes off as incredibly out of character. As much as Naruto wanted to become Hokage, he was even more about not abandoning his friends or family at the cost of everything. After all that he did for a long time traitor in Sasuke, I'm supposed to believe his weird sense of \"respect\" is priority over his family? Especially when he made a promise to be with his family?

Nobody is saying Naruto has to make like a 1000 clones who all read a paper each and get dispelled at once to overload his brain. He can easily pace himself by making a few clones who read one or two documents each, get dispelled one at a time and then his real self makes the final decision. This wouldn't drain him and would let him get through tedious paperwork quicker while at least allowing him some family time. Even if you think that's still too draining, that's just your opinion and not the actual reason given: some strange sense of respect where clones can't be assistants for paperwork in the Hokage office.\n\nI'm not denying Boruto isn't a poorly written character, but the whole reason between his strained relationship with his dad is just dumb. Especially the part where Naruto of all people would rather break a promise than have a short day for daughter's birthday. He's never been that person.",

They were really close! It just...doesn't make sense? Plus, we have Shikamaru here spending JUST as much time as Naruto at the office, if not more in some cases, and Shikadai doesn't hate his Dad! He's mature enough to understand! I just really don't understand why they did Naruto so dirty in Boruto, and I DO NOT approve!",

That's the difference between Minato, who himself didn't really want to become the hokage, but was chosen because of his skill, and Naruto WHOSE prolly most defining trait other than bringing Sasuke back was to become the hokage. So obviously he places more importance to his duty to the village than the duty to his wife and son. Only difference is that Himawari and Hinata just don't complain and keep their mouth shut whilst being sad on the inside. I mean it's the time of peace, he should be gangbangin Hinata all the time.  I mean, under his rule Konoha sure has developed a lot, but that makes him the greatest Hokage, not the greatest dad. Just because he suffered in family department doesn't mean he has to make others suffer.",

Does little himawari really need to be worrying about whether her father cares more about her than his work? How much does she know about shadow clones at this point anyway? Does she know that all experiences are retained or could she even comprehend that concept at that age? Whatever way you paint it, it\u2019s really shitty for naruto to send a shadowclone to his daughter\u2019s birthday and then let it pop prematurely despite the fact that a less experienced naruto defeated the third raikage easily using a shadow clone with his weakest transformation.",

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants. It\u2019s clear to me Boruto is super straight forward, basic, and a brat all at the same time and doesn\u2019t think things through",

A kid who knew no struggle growing up learns the importance of training and work ethic in real time, and it changes his entire perspective on strength. Not all characters need to be correct in their choices all the time. Boruto knows what he was doing was wrong and hated that he was in that situation, that\u2019s why he \u201cblamed\u201d Naruto.",

But even when he HAS chances for his father's attention, like on Parent-Child Day, he acts like his Dad is a dick and like he doesn't care, totally passes on the opportunity. Or like the ep where they go to ramen together, he mostly acts like he doesn't want anything to do with his Dad and still acts bratty.\n\nIDK, man, all I'm saying is, the way he went about it was wrong, and he should have known that, should have known that it would have the opposite effect from what he wanted. He's smart enough to know that. ESPECIALLY using it against his BEST FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD. Like, what did he expect would happen? What did he think would happen afterward when he couldn't replicate his win without the tool or when the Ninja Tools guy exposed him on his own to glorify his product? I'm not saying he needs to make the right choices the first time because how would he learn, but he still should have known better on his OWN. Besides, even if he still didn't, even if he still made this mistake, it was the way he HANDLED IT that, in my opinion, showed his true colors. They always say it's how you handle things, and he shoved all the blame on Naruto, who may be PARTIALLY at fault, but certainly not totally. If anything, I feel like it digs Boruto's grave as a character even more.\n\nI just feel like after 65+ eps and the MAIN CHARACTER is still pulling this same shit (I would understand it more from a side character - or at least for the MC to understand his mistake and not blame everyone else/try to make up for it better/sooner) and is STILL this unlikable and unsympathetic? I can't really stand by that. If NARUTO were that much of a cheating baby in the OG show, we'd all be saying the same thing, but because it's Boruto, seems like the Boruto fans want to make excuses. Doesn't really seem fair.",

Whether it was intentional or not, a cocky kid who flips between \"I'm the best, fuck you bitches\" and \"Wahhh my dad is too busy my life sucks\" is too obnoxious to care about when he dad experienced first hand the horrors of war and kill or be killed combat.\n\nObviously they are two different stories, we need to appreciate who and what Boruto is. If Boruto was it's own separate anime? Sure I wouldn't have had any issues with it, but it's a sequel to Naruto, you can't NOT compare some kid with a loving family whining about his dad being busy when his dad never had a family and was shunned and hated by 99% of his village.\n\nIdk what Boruto is up to now after the chakra stealing people, I watched clips of the time travel on YT, maybe the anime got way better and it'll be a classic in a decade, but I personally think it's a bit stupid to say you can't compare the two, if you want your audience to feel sorry for your main character, to empathize with them, don't have an entire series beforehand show his father going through even worse things at a younger age. \"Worse problems elsewhere don't invalidate your problems\" doesn't really apply to anime imo.",

And i understand how boruto would be compared to naruto. But, look at it from borutos perspective, he has a father whos the hokage, and doesn't visit his sisters birthday, which he valued more than his own. And also..i think you are a bit behind. Catch up in the anime. Boruto has already apologized to his father about how he didn't care about the load his father had, and naruto the same. He also has stopped saying how he hates his father. Also this is the perfect time to catch up..the new arc is one if the best, so thats your cue. And also remember, we have only seen the start of boruto. Theres so much more to come. And who knows, maybe boruto has a sad ending. No big spoilers, but momoshiki does say that boruto will lose everything. It feels to me that boruto has everything and will at the end have nothing. Nothings confirmed ofcourse. But this will definitely show how boruto has to cope through everything that he will lose. Thanks for ur opinion.",

Maybe they are setting up for a kinda of \u201copposite situation\u201d for boruto.",

Besides the people in the room with Amado and Boruto and Kawaki because if there obvious ties. Where Sarada doesn\u2019t have that immediate connection.

Boruto literally thinks about giving up as a Shinobi and resorts to cheating because he realizes he isn\u2019t the best just because he is naturally gifted. And the whole upset about dad stuff is mostly over after Boruto acknowledges the weight his dad carried after the momoshiki arc. I also hate the argument that people make that in order for a character to be good they have to have some tragic backstory like that simply is not true. Boruto has developed so much over the show and through the Manga and I am excited to see where he continues he has shown far more character development than Naruto ever did. And I love Naruto just to be clear but in terms of development it isn\u2019t even close Naruto is a very one note character.",

Maybe he gets a redemption arc. Not all main characters are good, perfect or likeable. Some take their time for their charecter to develop. Also boruto is gonna be a huge-ass story. Like im talking many years. So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

Naruto' s whole character was that he never go back on his words but Naruto broke his promise . The things you told about you and your family doesn't apply to Naruto cus any real human have limits . But he was shown making thousands of shadow clones during Chunin exams and fighting for whole day without being tired and during war arc he made thousands of shadow clones and found for days with only KCM-1 mode and after that he got KCM-2 which was a huge power boost and also sage of six paths chakra . So making thousands of clones and even doing all the work alone should not be a big problem for a person who can take on the whole Shinobi alliance by himself and still win. They gave us a lot of bull crap in the first half just to move the plot. Only for one night he can just leave his shadow clones to work and enjoy a night with his family. But even so after momoshiki arc both of them apologied to each other for not understanding and now he doesn't say anything like that . He have grown much. Now he just want to be a person who can protect The Hokage.",

At the very least, just have the clones read everything and dispel them to approve or reject stuff. \n\nIt's just lazy writing to me as it comes off as incredibly out of character. As much as Naruto wanted to become Hokage, he was even more about not abandoning his friends or family at the cost of everything. After all that he did for a long time traitor in Sasuke, I'm supposed to believe his weird sense of \"respect\" is priority over his family? Especially when he made a promise to be with his family?

Nobody is saying Naruto has to make like a 1000 clones who all read a paper each and get dispelled at once to overload his brain. He can easily pace himself by making a few clones who read one or two documents each, get dispelled one at a time and then his real self makes the final decision. This wouldn't drain him and would let him get through tedious paperwork quicker while at least allowing him some family time. Even if you think that's still too draining, that's just your opinion and not the actual reason given: some strange sense of respect where clones can't be assistants for paperwork in the Hokage office.\n\nI'm not denying Boruto isn't a poorly written character, but the whole reason between his strained relationship with his dad is just dumb. Especially the part where Naruto of all people would rather break a promise than have a short day for daughter's birthday. He's never been that person.",

They were really close! It just...doesn't make sense? Plus, we have Shikamaru here spending JUST as much time as Naruto at the office, if not more in some cases, and Shikadai doesn't hate his Dad!

That's the difference between Minato, who himself didn't really want to become the hokage, but was chosen because of his skill, and Naruto WHOSE prolly most defining trait other than bringing Sasuke back was to become the hokage. So obviously he places more importance to his duty to the village than the duty to his wife and son.

My mum would look after me for a good 8 years and then I took care of my sister. I understood everything. Boruto is a garbage character, nothing more. Himawari understood what it means to be a Hokage. Sarada hardly ever became a spoiled shit like Boruto, same with Shikadai.\n\nBoruto took a good 60 episodes to respect his dad and his role. Which shows how much of a failure Boruto is.\n\nAfter all that hard work, Naruto still was able to fulfil his promise and make it up to his kids.",

Then Kawaki offered to buy a new one and Boruto was still screaming so Kawaki took every single piece of that vase and put it back together except one small piece he couldn\u2019t find was missing. I would say that\u2019s a good example of Boruto overreacting like Kawaki felt so bad that he built the entire vase back together even though it shattered",

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants.

He knows and experiences his parents' love, and to have half of that all but disappear by the age of 6 or 7 obviously, and expectedly, created a negative impact. \n\nYou're hating on Boruto simply because you don't see things from his perspective, and you're an example of the disconnect between Naruto fans and Boruto I mentioned.",

A kid who knew no struggle growing up learns the importance of training and work ethic in real time, and it changes his entire perspective on strength.

But even when he HAS chances for his father's attention, like on Parent-Child Day, he acts like his Dad is a dick and like he doesn't care, totally passes on the opportunity. Or like the ep where they go to ramen together, he mostly acts like he doesn't want anything to do with his Dad and still acts bratty.\n\nIDK, man, all I'm saying is, the way he went about it was wrong, and he should have known that, should have known that it would have the opposite effect from what he wanted. He's smart enough to know that. ESPECIALLY using it against his BEST FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD. Like, what did he expect would happen? What did he think would happen afterward when he couldn't replicate his win without the tool or when the Ninja Tools guy exposed him on his own to glorify his product? I'm not saying he needs to make the right choices the first time because how would he learn, but he still should have known better on his OWN. Besides, even if he still didn't, even if he still made this mistake, it was the way he HANDLED IT that, in my opinion, showed his true colors. They always say it's how you handle things, and he shoved all the blame on Naruto, who may be PARTIALLY at fault, but certainly not totally. If anything, I feel like it digs Boruto's grave as a character even more.\n\nI just feel like after 65+ eps and the MAIN CHARACTER is still pulling this same shit (I would understand it more from a side character - or at least for the MC to understand his mistake and not blame everyone else/try to make up for it better/sooner) and is STILL this unlikable and unsympathetic? I can't really stand by that. If NARUTO were that much of a cheating baby in the OG show, we'd all be saying the same thing, but because it's Boruto, seems like the Boruto fans want to make excuses. Doesn't really seem fair.",

And i understand how boruto would be compared to naruto. But, look at it from borutos perspective, he has a father whos the hokage, and doesn't visit his sisters birthday, which he valued more than his own. And also..i think you are a bit behind. Catch up in the anime. Boruto has already apologized to his father about how he didn't care about the load his father had, and naruto the same. He also has stopped saying how he hates his father. Also this is the perfect time to catch up..the new arc is one if the best, so thats your cue. And also remember, we have only seen the start of boruto. Theres so much more to come. And who knows, maybe boruto has a sad ending. No big spoilers, but momoshiki does say that boruto will lose everything. It feels to me that boruto has everything and will at the end have nothing. Nothings confirmed ofcourse. But this will definitely show how boruto has to cope through everything that he will lose. Thanks for ur opinion.",

I think personally they kinda made him dislikable just so he can have a \u201credemption arc\u201d because no matter what even if people hated the show they knew people were gonna watch. Maybe they are setting up for a kinda of \u201copposite situation\u201d for boruto.",

And the whole upset about dad stuff is mostly over after Boruto acknowledges the weight his dad carried after the momoshiki arc. I also hate the argument that people make that in order for a character to be good they have to have some tragic backstory like that simply is not true. Boruto has developed so much over the show and through the Manga and I am excited to see where he continues he has shown far more character development than Naruto ever did. And I love Naruto just to be clear but in terms of development it isn\u2019t even close Naruto is a very one note character.",

So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

At the very least, just have the clones read everything and dispel them to approve or reject stuff. \n\nIt's just lazy writing to me as it comes off as incredibly out of character.

He can easily pace himself by making a few clones who read one or two documents each, get dispelled one at a time and then his real self makes the final decision. This wouldn't drain him and would let him get through tedious paperwork quicker while at least allowing him some family time. Even if you think that's still too draining, that's just your opinion and not the actual reason given: some strange sense of respect where clones can't be assistants for paperwork in the Hokage office.\n\nI'm not denying Boruto isn't a poorly written character, but the whole reason between his strained relationship with his dad is just dumb.

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants.

A kid who knew no struggle growing up learns the importance of training and work ethic in real time, and it changes his entire perspective on strength.

But even when he HAS chances for his father's attention, like on Parent-Child Day, he acts like his Dad is a dick and like he doesn't care, totally passes on the opportunity. Or like the ep where they go to ramen together, he mostly acts like he doesn't want anything to do with his Dad and still acts bratty.\n\nIDK, man, all I'm saying is, the way he went about it was wrong, and he should have known that, should have known that it would have the opposite effect from what he wanted. He's smart enough to know that. ESPECIALLY using it against his BEST FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD. Like, what did he expect would happen? What did he think would happen afterward when he couldn't replicate his win without the tool or when the Ninja Tools guy exposed him on his own to glorify his product? I'm not saying he needs to make the right choices the first time because how would he learn, but he still should have known better on his OWN. Besides, even if he still didn't, even if he still made this mistake, it was the way he HANDLED IT that, in my opinion, showed his true colors. They always say it's how you handle things, and he shoved all the blame on Naruto, who may be PARTIALLY at fault, but certainly not totally. If anything, I feel like it digs Boruto's grave as a character even more.\n\nI just feel like after 65+ eps and the MAIN CHARACTER is still pulling this same shit (I would understand it more from a side character - or at least for the MC to understand his mistake and not blame everyone else/try to make up for it better/sooner) and is STILL this unlikable and unsympathetic? I can't really stand by that. If NARUTO were that much of a cheating baby in the OG show, we'd all be saying the same thing, but because it's Boruto, seems like the Boruto fans want to make excuses. Doesn't really seem fair.",

(I\u2019ve had that phase lol)\n\nI mean that whole character arc is what makes him one of my favorite characters in the whole story, I think it\u2019s unique for a character to be shown making and then learning from his mistakes. I think it\u2019s a good way for him to get motivated to be stronger as a kid without having his family murdered or being the nine tails if that makes sense",

Not all main characters are good, perfect or likeable. Some take their time for their charecter to develop. Also boruto is gonna be a huge-ass story. Like im talking many years. So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

My mum would look after me for a good 8 years and then I took care of my sister. I understood everything. Boruto is a garbage character, nothing more. If he is worn out and he creates clones then that would affect his clones. Being mentally drained is much more different than being physically tired.

He can easily pace himself by making a few clones who read one or two documents each, get dispelled one at a time and then his real self makes the final decision. This wouldn't drain him and would let him get through tedious paperwork quicker while at least allowing him some family time. Even if you think that's still too draining, that's just your opinion and not the actual reason given: some strange sense of respect where clones can't be assistants for paperwork in the Hokage office.\n\nI'm not denying Boruto isn't a poorly written character, but the whole reason between his strained relationship with his dad is just dumb. Especially the part where Naruto of all people would rather break a promise than have a short day for daughter's birthday. He's never been that person.",

They were really close! It just...doesn't make sense? Plus, we have Shikamaru here spending JUST as much time as Naruto at the office, if not more in some cases, and Shikadai doesn't hate his Dad!

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants. It\u2019s clear to me Boruto is super straight forward, basic, and a brat all at the same time and doesn\u2019t think things through",

But even when he HAS chances for his father's attention, like on Parent-Child Day, he acts like his Dad is a dick and like he doesn't care, totally passes on the opportunity. Or like the ep where they go to ramen together, he mostly acts like he doesn't want anything to do with his Dad and still acts bratty.\n\nIDK, man, all I'm saying is, the way he went about it was wrong, and he should have known that, should have known that it would have the opposite effect from what he wanted. He's smart enough to know that. ESPECIALLY using it against his BEST FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD. Like, what did he expect would happen? What did he think would happen afterward when he couldn't replicate his win without the tool or when the Ninja Tools guy exposed him on his own to glorify his product? I'm not saying he needs to make the right choices the first time because how would he learn, but he still should have known better on his OWN. Besides, even if he still didn't, even if he still made this mistake, it was the way he HANDLED IT that, in my opinion, showed his true colors. They always say it's how you handle things, and he shoved all the blame on Naruto, who may be PARTIALLY at fault, but certainly not totally. If anything, I feel like it digs Boruto's grave as a character even more.\n\nI just feel like after 65+ eps and the MAIN CHARACTER is still pulling this same shit (I would understand it more from a side character - or at least for the MC to understand his mistake and not blame everyone else/try to make up for it better/sooner) and is STILL this unlikable and unsympathetic? I can't really stand by that. If NARUTO were that much of a cheating baby in the OG show, we'd all be saying the same thing, but because it's Boruto, seems like the Boruto fans want to make excuses. Doesn't really seem fair.",

I think it\u2019s a good way for him to get motivated to be stronger as a kid without having his family murdered or being the nine tails if that makes sense",

Not all main characters are good, perfect or likeable. Some take their time for their charecter to develop. Also boruto is gonna be a huge-ass story. Like im talking many years. So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

Nobody is saying Naruto has to make like a 1000 clones who all read a paper each and get dispelled at once to overload his brain. He can easily pace himself by making a few clones who read one or two documents each, get dispelled one at a time and then his real self makes the final decision. This wouldn't drain him and would let him get through tedious paperwork quicker while at least allowing him some family time. Even if you think that's still too draining, that's just your opinion and not the actual reason given: some strange sense of respect where clones can't be assistants for paperwork in the Hokage office.\n\nI'm not denying Boruto isn't a poorly written character, but the whole reason between his strained relationship with his dad is just dumb. Especially the part where Naruto of all people would rather break a promise than have a short day for daughter's birthday. He's never been that person.",

They were really close! It just...doesn't make sense? Plus, we have Shikamaru here spending JUST as much time as Naruto at the office, if not more in some cases, and Shikadai doesn't hate his Dad!

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream.

If anything, that should tell you that Boruto loves his family and just wanted things how they were before Naruto became Hokage.",

Not all main characters are good, perfect or likeable. Some take their time for their charecter to develop. Also boruto is gonna be a huge-ass story. Like im talking many years. So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

They were really close! It just...doesn't make sense? Plus, we have Shikamaru here spending JUST as much time as Naruto at the office, if not more in some cases, and Shikadai doesn't hate his Dad!

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants.

So who nows how borutos charecter will develop. Maybe boruto becomes the villain, who knows, maybe it will show how the dark side of shinobi is, that sasuke went through. To me it seems as if sarada is going to be the one who changes boruto. Like how naruto did to sasuke. Also, it didn't take nearly 70 eps to like him. I liked him before that as well. But he gained our respect for sure after that. I mean even naruto said that he himself was wrong. Then why put all the blame on boruto. According to me, i think the show is trying to show how having a family doesn't mean a child will be perfect. Look at sasuke..he was annoying when he had family..and then you know what happened right. Maybe that might happen to boruto too.",

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream.

Or that time when Boruto decided it was a good idea to go up to Naruto and punch him in the gut to check if he was a shadow clone but in reality could have done just about anything differently instead of punching him because he felt he needed it even though Naruto is just doing his job and following his life long dream. There\u2019s also another time where they\u2019re fighting in the kitchen because Himawari is sick and Naruto is trying to help her by getting her something that\u2019s best for sick people and Boruto is trying to get her what she wants.

I rarely see my brothers, and my father has purposely poisoned me but I wouldn't throw them or my wonderful mom away to be rid of him.",

I just as you hope her time comes again in the manga to show her stuff. My honest hope is that Sarada goes through some shit if that all happens and becomes independently strong\n\nShe needs something really bad to happen to her and realize she has to get stronger. Realizing how strong isshiki is would be a good start \n\nBut again I'm very pessimistic if she will be even shown in the upcoming conflict",

My honest hope is that Sarada goes through some shit if that all happens and becomes independently strong\n\nShe needs something really bad to happen to her and realize she has to get stronger. Realizing how strong isshiki is would be a good start \n\nBut again I'm very pessimistic if she will be even shown in the upcoming conflict",
