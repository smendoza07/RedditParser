    "body": "(This is my 4th draft now lol. I don't know why but I can't seem to articulate properly how much I appreciate this show, hopefully this one's my final draft.)\n\nI've been a fan of the show since 2012 when I was in fifth grade and now I am about to finish my first year in college, to be honest I hadn't realized how long I've been a fan until I watched the fan meet episodes.\n\nI still remember how *iconic* the early episodes of Running Man were (specifically, those from 2010-13). JSJ's \"*I swear*\", the nametag eliminations, Yoomes Bond, Running Man and Grasshopper Hunting, Running Man Olympics, the spy missions, their overseas trips, crossing the Han River and so many more.\n\nAt the same time, I also remember the show seemingly running out of steam from 2014 until So Min and Se Chan were added to the show. As someone who's been a fan for so long, the episodes after Gary left and before SM + SC were added were so sad to watch. Those episodes were, in my opinion, the \"low point\" for the show, especially since the show almost got cancelled during that span. By this time, I would watch the show sparingly.\n\nSo Min and Se Chan were such great additions to the show, they literally gave it new life. By 2019, I began to watch the show much more regularly than I did before (especially during the preparation for the Fan Meet episodes), Though the show has improved significantly by this time, I still longed for a \"return\" to the old Running Man. More nametag eliminations, more dramatic final races, etc.\n\nBut with the run that Running Man has been going on since 2018 has being so great, I don't wish for a return to the old episodes anymore. First, obviously the members have been getting older, but second, and much more importantly, their current set-up fits the members so well. Honestly, and I know many would disagree, the stretch of episodes that Running Man has been going on are as good as the ones from 2010-13.\n\nThough they may not be as intense/exciting as the one's from Running Man's early days, they have been the **funniest**. Kwang Soo singing *The Lion Sleeps Tonight* and the mission where Jong Kook and Kwang Soo had to not laugh will never fail to make me laugh.\n\nIn the end, I'm so happy that the members decided to continue the show even though it was so difficult for them to do so back then. I'm so proud and thankful of them for working so hard to make us all laugh for 1.5 hours straight every week. I honestly hope that the show will go until they reach 1000 episodes (okay I'm half kidding here \u2013 then again, I do wanna see them do the fan meet dance when JSJ is in his 60s lol).",

But like any other shows, it's not forever. \n\nThe members has been running every week for more than ten years already. All of them are already hitting their primes, which is not forever. Eventually, they'll either leave the show one by one, or as a whole.\n\nOnce that happen, one thing I hope that the SBS should do is to not abandon the Running Man concept entirely. Which is what they're trying to do by exporting the franchise to other countries, especially in China and the South East Asia. \n\nBut for the Korean Running Man, although for some it's unpopular, I would welcome the idea that they would either add new members that'll gradually take over once that unevitable end would come. But they don't have to do it now, but at some point in the future they should consider that too.\n\nRunning Man is not just a variety show. It is a culture. And that culture is meant to be enjoyed by the next generation too.\n\nLOL! It looks like I've gone too far... HAHAHAHA",

            "body": "Same here. Started watching Running Man in 2015. I watched it because of SNSD, I became curious and watched the other earlier episodes and got hooked since then.\n\nI do agree that the show hit a low point in 2016, when Gary left the show. But I've got to mention also that the episodes got a little bit bland when Taek PD left the show months prior. \n\nI also do agree that the 2010 - 2013 is the Golden Age of Running Man. Every episode is intense, and it still gives me chills everytime I rewatch them. \n\nDecember 2016, it became apparent that the show will end due to the dispute between the members and the staffs. I stopped watching the show at that point since it became boring. But I've got to admit that there's still a couple of good episodes at that time, but the member's week still breaks my heart.\n\nAt first, I'm a little bit skeptical with the addition of Sechan and Somin. But when I watched that, guess what, SNSD episode, I've became hooked again. It doesn't have the same intensity as the Early 2010s episode, but it still gives you that chills.\n\n2018 - present is like the 2nd Golden Age of Running Man. I'm disappointed at first about the change in format as it became more of a talk show than an actual variety show. But I realized that the members are getting older, and having the same format as before will do more harm than good.\n\nRunning Man get me through my low times. I've watched it when my grades are falling apart, when I'm having family and relationship problems and when I'm going through anxiety and depression. I felt like I am a part of their cast when I am watching them, and it's like a kind of escape or relief for me. \n\nI'll always be thankful to the show, and to the fan community also. Fellow Runners also help me get through the hard times and I've found a lot of friends in the community too.\n\nI'll be always thankful and grateful for Running Man!!!",

I still believe RM's golden era is from 2010-2013; everything went well from ratings to ep mechanics. It was hard to watch RM without Gary and it was even evident to the other casts, those times were the lowest point of the show. I usually rewatch every ep atleast 3 times but I can't bear to watch the Gary's last episode and after those. Especially the member's week, it was torturing me, I only enjoyed Sukjin's week ep. \n\nWas quite not sure about Somin and Sechan at first but it was really a very good decision to add them on the cast, it gave RM a new life. I want to think that we are getting RM's 2nd peak after 2010-2013 era. I really love almost all of Bo Pil's episode, the games are unique but really funny. I'm not quite a fan of Iron Min (this dude gives difficult games) but tried to rewatch his episodes and it was pretty decent but still prefer Bo Pil \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 BUT you can't deny he did saved the show. \n\nSince there are a lot of platforms now to consider, the ratings of the show does not necessarily reflect RM's success now. BUT I hope Bo Pil will manage to bring back an ep that can reach double digit rating, I think it will be a very good compliment for the staffs hard work behind the scenes.",

What I would want to see is the last few episodes of running man to be recruitment episodes where the talent finds talent to continue the show into a \"season 2\".  As Somin and Kwang Soo are running man born comedians, I feel this show can give rise to many different personalities and give others a place to shine.",

Eventually, they'll either leave the show one by one, or as a whole.\n\nOnce that happen, one thing I hope that the SBS should do is to not abandon the Running Man concept entirely. Which is what they're trying to do by exporting the franchise to other countries, especially in China and the South East Asia. \n\nBut for the Korean Running Man, although for some it's unpopular, I would welcome the idea that they would either add new members that'll gradually take over once that unevitable end would come. But they don't have to do it now, but at some point in the future they should consider that too.\n\nRunning Man is not just a variety show. It is a culture. And that culture is meant to be enjoyed by the next generation too.\n\nLOL! It looks like I've gone too far... HAHAHAHA",
