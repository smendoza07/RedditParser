    "body": "\\begin{rant}\n\nTL;DR: I went on a trip with my 36 year old, ultra wealthy SD for NYE to an exotic destination (5-day-long trip). On Day 2 (1 Jan), he told me I would not be joining him for the rest of the trip and my flight home was that afternoon, while the girl he decided to bring instead sat on the edge of the bed with her suitcase next to her. \n\n\nSo, as promised, here are some reasons to skip POT SDs who are under 40 and ultra wealthy (these qualities might be alright independently, mind you; it\u2019s the two together which are deadly)...\n\n1. Men who are young and extremely rich have a lot of opportunities to do whatever they want, whenever they want, to *or* with whomever they please. You will experience a level of entitlement which is challenged by few; and, if you have a fundamental issue or moral conflict with this, it will *intensify* quickly.\n\n2. The people who this man surrounds himself with are likely friends and peers in his industry (specific or general business). They will all carry themselves well, dress properly, be kind and intelligent and attractive, and will overall be easy to get along with. You will have a false sense of security being around these people. These people will know very well the player-tendencies of the SD in question, and likely openly discuss his escapades and ways in front of you. You will be expected to tolerate this degradation and even laugh about it openly. If you have a fundamental issue or moral conflict with this, it will *intensify* quickly.\n\n3. When attempting to set boundaries, the SD will invalidate your feelings, manipulate your emotions, and exert power by reminding you that you are there to please and serve him, in whichever way he sees for, regardless of how you feel or how you think you will be perceived in the eyes of others. He will say this is the expectation, and you do not serve a purpose being near or around him if you do not want to be grabbed inappropriately in public, for example. If you have a fundamental issue or moral conflict with this, it will *intensify* quickly.\n\n4. You will be looked at as an object, not a person. You will not be romanced, cared for, stared into your eyes before you kiss. You will be tying your shoes while he grabs you Donald Trump style in the hotel lobby, or you will be sitting on the bed when he asks \u201care you going to stay there for a few minutes?\u201d as he unzips his pants. When you reject these types of advances, he will resent you. If you have a fundamental issue or moral conflict with this, it will *intensify* quickly.\n\n5. You will be emotionally exhausted and feel deep levels of violation, lack of ability to trust, and insecurity due to the trauma that he will subject you to. He will be unreliable, self centered, destructive, flamboyant, arrogant, demanding, and degenerative. He will not care if he hurts you, because you are replaceable. If you attempt to correct him, he will complain that he does not care, that he has heard it all before, and will tune out. You will not be able to show him anything, teach him anything, enlighten him, change or fix his behaviors. You will burn *yourself* out trying to save him. \n\n\nI am now a firm believer in *all* the advices from this sub... previously, I have defended younger SDs. Said how fun they are, and how worth it it can be to spend time with them. I fully retract that opinion and have now learned the lesson fully. \n\nLurkers, please READ and REMEMBER this. Do not let the lifestyle fool you. Don\u2019t get lost in the ideology of luxury over everything. Flying to the next destinations, staying with the best accommodations, dining in the finest places, attending high profile parties with celebrities, yada yada yada... at this level, it\u2019s simply not worth it. Unless you are ready to *sell your soul*, skip it. \n\n\\end{rant}",

An endless flow of money into expensive habits/addictions like cocaine and alcohol paired with narcissism/the grandiose self image equally combines to create a toxic, unsafe environment. In many cases, people just like this without a lot of money or good looks and youth attempt to replicate such scenarios, but can\u2019t. So, you\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t just the partying. Likewise, people with narcissistic traits and lots of money that do *not* participate in such a party oriented lifestyle infrequently put others in such specific danger with altered behavior and decision making skills. Like my friend I mentioned above; in her story, I am 100% certain she wouldn\u2019t have had her face shoved into a pile of cocaine while tied up and unable to protest were the man not set in his partying ways\u2014because the cocaine wouldn\u2019t have existed in that story. The guy and his friends were part of the problem; partying was part of the problem. It was a multifaceted issue.\n\nEdit: you said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the fun part.\u201d The comment you replied to was stating there *was* no fun part in the story OP told us. Partying is only fun if it\u2019s consensual and safe, and the constant fear of sexual assault alone would suck the consensual and safe out of anything.",

A functioning productive male with some, not even a lot of resources doesn't need the bowl at that age, and if they do, it's because they're morbidly obese, handicapped, elephant man ugly, suffer from a blatant personality disorder, or socially stunted.\n\nThese guys are patting themselves on the back about how prized they are, and they must certainly be getting lower PPM requests than those \"stinking fat old men over 40\", when it's clear a large contingent of SBs automatically red flag them for many nasty reasons. and they're lucky to find a nieve SB to take them on, until she comes here posting about what a terrible experience she had vs older SDs.",

And as I stated before, though you chose to ignore it because it would demolish your narrative, there are beautiful women at 50 and beyond. Some women may peak before or after 23, but on average, at 23 the objective signs of physical attractiveness peaks. Facial symmetry, plump lips, dewey skin, enlarged pupils. \n\nLuckily we as humans don't limit attractiveness to these  characteristics. But they are real, and work on all men at the biological level. \nIt's enjoyable, no, intoxicating (thank you pheromones)  to experience the impact of being in the presence of a woman in her physical prime, and that bothers you terribly.\n\nIt applies to all men as well, though an important element of our attractiveness, the ability to provide, peaks in line with the performance reported on our quarterly statements, not something as wistfully fragile as fleeting youth.",

(ex: a guy who used to report to me had a company he started purchased for $200M cash 10 years later)\n\nA good number of the these young CEO Entrepreneur types (and there are easily 100+ wannabes for every actual one that hits the 8-figure club) have (borrowing a term here, so please allow me) \"dark triad\" traits.  i.e. Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.\n\nThose traits have served them well in fighting their way to success, usually on path littered with the bodies of others they've dispatched.  I've seen sooo many times when one of these guys screws over their other partner(s), employees or even customers.\n\nIt's such a bleeping competitive landscape, where winning at all costs is only what matters, that those traits make doing what it takes to come out on top more palatable. \n\nThe older guys on average are going to have experienced more downs and humbling moments and become more 'grown up' when it comes to dealing with people.  The younger guys usually haven't and will tend to assume that if you are not as successful as them, you are a lesser human being, because obviously it's all because they are so great.  They're also more likely to be caught up in the 'party lifestyle' and displaying to the world just how awesome and successful they are. \n\nObviously, it's not everyone.  But for the reasons I just stated, I have seen a greate concentration of the attitudes and behaviors the OP described in that segment of young stuck up guys whose combination of ruthlessness and luck has them believing their own hype when they say they are going to be the next 'Steve Jobs'.",

But I've had my share of run-ins, conflicts and working with/for with people who are absolutely psychopaths.  (I do think the trait starts to work against them at the highest levels of success). \n\nThe two wealthiest friends (9-figure club) I have are really great and outstanding people, and I think your observation about selection bias is right.  Once a person reaches a high level of wealth, (and it shows up in data) things change in their life - they are constantly approached by everyone from exclusive civic clubs, university alumni orgs, cancer centers, you name it, and they have look at how they interact with the world differently are more cautiously.\n\nThere are 2 individuals that I know personally that are a) started their own companies, b) under 45, c) net worth in the $5-20m range and d) would absolutely behave like OP's SD (based on behaving that badly already) and I would never deal with them again.   One of these guy in particular (currently CEO of a 35ish person software company) inspired me to make the post, so I blame him. \n\nIt's the 'wannabes' group that actually worry me more.  I do see more ruthlessness and disregard there.  I've been around so many people trying to figure out how to make a startup and they are working from their 'exit strategy' backwards, not because they see a way to make something great or lives better, but because they want to get rich, and that's all.  And they are constantly hustling to get \"there\" and it's such a priority that everyone else is disposable and expendable, and if they drop a bomb on someone.. it's 'oh well..'\n\nI've seen too much 'winner take all' competition and shitting on people when it wasn't necessary, that I stand by my particular first hand observations, but I think the big picture totally includes yours as well.  And I don't mind adding clarification and nuance.   I certainly wasn't trying to say \"all\" as I only know a small sliver of occupations, but I do see it (tech+startups) as one of the more 'wild west' sectors out there, with it's share prospectors, settlers, and crooks.",

So I arrived around 1 pm, he arrived around midnight. \n\nSo, the first 12 hours? We went to some mansion party around 1 am, or what remained of the party anyways. Drugs galore, alcohol free flowing, maybe 10 people left. He talked with two other people about business the whole time. We left around 4:30 am. \n\nBack at the hotel, and my sneaker came untied (we were all casual, sneakers were acceptable). I bent over to tie my shoe. He grabs me underneath my skirt. I slap away his hand out of our shock and squealed, as I half hopped away-half fell over. I hit the ground, someone who works there runs over to help me up as SD calls the elevator. I was drunk. Front desk agent walks me to SD, who doesn\u2019t say anything (is busy texting). From the elevator doors closing to back in the room, he reprimands me for hitting away his hand. Goes from saying his exwife used to do this and it annoys him, to \u201cif [my] purpose being there ISNT to please [him]\u201d, what am I doing there?, to \u201cI know we talked about expectations before the trip and this wasn\u2019t mentioned, but it is now\u201d.",

I have a belief that in every sugar relationship both sides need to bring something that the other might not have. \nThe classic example is the older SD way past his prime offering financial support to date a much younger lady. The equation somehow balances out. On the other hand one could be young (30s or 40s) but married and a discreet sugar relationship balances out the equation. \n\nBut when someone is young, wealthy, single, it\u2019s very very hard for the SB to bring value to that relationship and balance that equation.

An endless flow of money into expensive habits/addictions like cocaine and alcohol paired with narcissism/the grandiose self image equally combines to create a toxic, unsafe environment. In many cases, people just like this without a lot of money or good looks and youth attempt to replicate such scenarios, but can\u2019t. So, you\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t just the partying. Likewise, people with narcissistic traits and lots of money that do *not* participate in such a party oriented lifestyle infrequently put others in such specific danger with altered behavior and decision making skills. Like my friend I mentioned above; in her story, I am 100% certain she wouldn\u2019t have had her face shoved into a pile of cocaine while tied up and unable to protest were the man not set in his partying ways\u2014because the cocaine wouldn\u2019t have existed in that story. The guy and his friends were part of the problem; partying was part of the problem. It was a multifaceted issue.\n\nEdit: you said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the fun part.\u201d The comment you replied to was stating there *was* no fun part in the story OP told us. Partying is only fun if it\u2019s consensual and safe, and the constant fear of sexual assault alone would suck the consensual and safe out of anything.",

But I've had my share of run-ins, conflicts and working with/for with people who are absolutely psychopaths.  (I do think the trait starts to work against them at the highest levels of success). \n\nThe two wealthiest friends (9-figure club) I have are really great and outstanding people, and I think your observation about selection bias is right.  Once a person reaches a high level of wealth, (and it shows up in data) things change in their life - they are constantly approached by everyone from exclusive civic clubs, university alumni orgs, cancer centers, you name it, and they have look at how they interact with the world differently are more cautiously.\n\nThere are 2 individuals that I know personally that are a) started their own companies, b) under 45, c) net worth in the $5-20m range and d) would absolutely behave like OP's SD (based on behaving that badly already) and I would never deal with them again.   One of these guy in particular (currently CEO of a 35ish person software company) inspired me to make the post, so I blame him. \n\nIt's the 'wannabes' group that actually worry me more.  I do see more ruthlessness and disregard there.  I've been around so many people trying to figure out how to make a startup and they are working from their 'exit strategy' backwards, not because they see a way to make something great or lives better, but because they want to get rich, and that's all.  And they are constantly hustling to get \"there\" and it's such a priority that everyone else is disposable and expendable, and if they drop a bomb on someone.. it's 'oh well..'\n\nI've seen too much 'winner take all' competition and shitting on people when it wasn't necessary, that I stand by my particular first hand observations, but I think the big picture totally includes yours as well.  And I don't mind adding clarification and nuance.   I certainly wasn't trying to say \"all\" as I only know a small sliver of occupations, but I do see it (tech+startups) as one of the more 'wild west' sectors out there, with it's share prospectors, settlers, and crooks.",

I blacked out after the talk about the ex wife hitting his hand and me not being allowed to. I remember passing out in my night clothes (silk camise and shorts) but woke up in one of my tshirts and a bra and no panties. I don\u2019t know what happened. He said we didn\u2019t have sex...\n\nNSFW and GRAPHC TAG. STOP READING-\nI see your stories and have another horrid one to add. During that day, he told me this stomach turning story. After seeing one of his friends post a selfie on Instagram. It was of her in the mirror on one of her friends private jets. \n\nHe looks everyone of his friends and goes \u201c-ah! look! the season must be picking back up.\u201d I looked at him and said \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d \n\nHe proceeded to tell me about these girls who go to Dubai two or three times per year. They\u2019re given about $50-$60,000 in cash, stay in the nicest places, get a lot of gifts\u2026 \n\nYou can only imagine. In exchange, the girls have to do horrible sexual things on some random island built by these rich guys. He told me it was things like having multiple guys (5-10) per session gang rape, baseball bats with condoms being put in their vaginas, anal bleeding, taking shits on them and peeing on them\u2026 all of these ridiculous things. \n-END NSFW CONTENT-\n\nThen took a sip of his drink and continued texting. \n\nOverall I am happy that I never have to see him again and plan on vanilla dating until I feel normal again.",

An endless flow of money into expensive habits/addictions like cocaine and alcohol paired with narcissism/the grandiose self image equally combines to create a toxic, unsafe environment. In many cases, people just like this without a lot of money or good looks and youth attempt to replicate such scenarios, but can\u2019t. So, you\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t just the partying. Likewise, people with narcissistic traits and lots of money that do *not* participate in such a party oriented lifestyle infrequently put others in such specific danger with altered behavior and decision making skills. Like my friend I mentioned above; in her story, I am 100% certain she wouldn\u2019t have had her face shoved into a pile of cocaine while tied up and unable to protest were the man not set in his partying ways\u2014because the cocaine wouldn\u2019t have existed in that story. The guy and his friends were part of the problem; partying was part of the problem. It was a multifaceted issue.\n\nEdit: you said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the fun part.\u201d The comment you replied to was stating there *was* no fun part in the story OP told us. Partying is only fun if it\u2019s consensual and safe, and the constant fear of sexual assault alone would suck the consensual and safe out of anything.",

But I've had my share of run-ins, conflicts and working with/for with people who are absolutely psychopaths.  (I do think the trait starts to work against them at the highest levels of success). \n\nThe two wealthiest friends (9-figure club) I have are really great and outstanding people, and I think your observation about selection bias is right.  Once a person reaches a high level of wealth, (and it shows up in data) things change in their life - they are constantly approached by everyone from exclusive civic clubs, university alumni orgs, cancer centers, you name it, and they have look at how they interact with the world differently are more cautiously.\n\nThere are 2 individuals that I know personally that are a) started their own companies, b) under 45, c) net worth in the $5-20m range and d) would absolutely behave like OP's SD (based on behaving that badly already) and I would never deal with them again.   One of these guy in particular (currently CEO of a 35ish person software company) inspired me to make the post, so I blame him. \n\nIt's the 'wannabes' group that actually worry me more.  I do see more ruthlessness and disregard there.  I've been around so many people trying to figure out how to make a startup and they are working from their 'exit strategy' backwards, not because they see a way to make something great or lives better, but because they want to get rich, and that's all.  And they are constantly hustling to get \"there\" and it's such a priority that everyone else is disposable and expendable, and if they drop a bomb on someone.. it's 'oh well..'\n\nI've seen too much 'winner take all' competition and shitting on people when it wasn't necessary, that I stand by my particular first hand observations, but I think the big picture totally includes yours as well.  And I don't mind adding clarification and nuance.   I certainly wasn't trying to say \"all\" as I only know a small sliver of occupations, but I do see it (tech+startups) as one of the more 'wild west' sectors out there, with it's share prospectors, settlers, and crooks.",

It\u2019s more along the lines of being forced into something they likely don\u2019t want to do because they have no other choices, and less so consensual. Especially since once they go, they can\u2019t say no to much, or they will face consequences. It\u2019s just as sad.",

Likewise, people with narcissistic traits and lots of money that do *not* participate in such a party oriented lifestyle infrequently put others in such specific danger with altered behavior and decision making skills. Like my friend I mentioned above; in her story, I am 100% certain she wouldn\u2019t have had her face shoved into a pile of cocaine while tied up and unable to protest were the man not set in his partying ways\u2014because the cocaine wouldn\u2019t have existed in that story.

This isn't some rare event, it comes up numerous times a month, by SBs themselves .\n\nCouple this with the fact the only information SDs have regarding PPM of others they have is what their SB may tell them and what they pay.

It sounds like you are saying to avoid all SDs under 40 or all of whom are ultra wealthy. In general. \n\nYou could have said \u2018why do I have issues with SDs who are under 40 or ultra wealthy\u2019. Perhaps it\u2019s your vetting process, because this guy sounds like a major asshole, and I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get any sense of that when talking to him prior to the trip. So perhaps there is room for you to grow in that area if you are still staying in the bowl after this. \n\nI think a simple edit can help correct this post to avoid slandering those under 40, because it sounds like that was not your intention at all.

An endless flow of money into expensive habits/addictions like cocaine and alcohol paired with narcissism/the grandiose self image equally combines to create a toxic, unsafe environment. In many cases, people just like this without a lot of money or good looks and youth attempt to replicate such scenarios, but can\u2019t. So, you\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t just the partying. Likewise, people with narcissistic traits and lots of money that do *not* participate in such a party oriented lifestyle infrequently put others in such specific danger with altered behavior and decision making skills. Like my friend I mentioned above; in her story, I am 100% certain she wouldn\u2019t have had her face shoved into a pile of cocaine while tied up and unable to protest were the man not set in his partying ways\u2014because the cocaine wouldn\u2019t have existed in that story. The guy and his friends were part of the problem; partying was part of the problem. It was a multifaceted issue.\n\nEdit: you said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the fun part.\u201d The comment you replied to was stating there *was* no fun part in the story OP told us. Partying is only fun if it\u2019s consensual and safe, and the constant fear of sexual assault alone would suck the consensual and safe out of anything.",

It sounds like you are saying to avoid all SDs under 40 or all of whom are ultra wealthy. In general. \n\nYou could have said \u2018why do I have issues with SDs who are under 40 or ultra wealthy\u2019. Perhaps it\u2019s your vetting process, because this guy sounds like a major asshole, and I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get any sense of that when talking to him prior to the trip. So perhaps there is room for you to grow in that area if you are still staying in the bowl after this. \n\nI think a simple edit can help correct this post to avoid slandering those under 40, because it sounds like that was not your intention at all.

An endless flow of money into expensive habits/addictions like cocaine and alcohol paired with narcissism/the grandiose self image equally combines to create a toxic, unsafe environment. In many cases, people just like this without a lot of money or good looks and youth attempt to replicate such scenarios, but can\u2019t. So, you\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t just the partying. Likewise, people with narcissistic traits and lots of money that do *not* participate in such a party oriented lifestyle infrequently put others in such specific danger with altered behavior and decision making skills. Like my friend I mentioned above; in her story, I am 100% certain she wouldn\u2019t have had her face shoved into a pile of cocaine while tied up and unable to protest were the man not set in his partying ways\u2014because the cocaine wouldn\u2019t have existed in that story. The guy and his friends were part of the problem; partying was part of the problem. It was a multifaceted issue.\n\nEdit: you said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the fun part.\u201d The comment you replied to was stating there *was* no fun part in the story OP told us. Partying is only fun if it\u2019s consensual and safe, and the constant fear of sexual assault alone would suck the consensual and safe out of anything.",
