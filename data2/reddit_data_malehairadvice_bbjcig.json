                    "body": "I think of a table as a spectrum of time. From the moment they sit to the moment they leave they can behave how they like towards me. A lot of people feel anxiety or just aren\u2019t themselves when they\u2019re hungry. I like to joke with servers having a bad night that a lot of people feel better after a bright smile, enduring patience, hot food, and cold drinks. Don\u2019t fail at any one of these things and you will always be tipped and your priorities will always be set. Keep the drinks full. Take things away that aren\u2019t in use (cluttered tables are uncomfortable.). Say you\u2019re new as long as you fuck up new things. People will be more graceful about it. If my coworkers are crabby to me about their tables still then I smile and say the same thing then offer them snack/water/ibuprofen/cover tables for a smoke break/gum. People aren\u2019t themselves all the time. Take them for their best and trust that they aren\u2019t always their worst. Some people are prejudiced against you. These people won\u2019t be pleased except by being Shitty. Ignore them and smile; the next time you have a table you actually like or that does something kind for you, enjoy it all the more, knowing that shitty person isn\u2019t Jading you and you are wonderful. That shitty person didn\u2019t deserve you. Idk. I love the validation from serving. People 100% aren\u2019t themselves when they\u2019re hungry. Also, you\u2019re trying to get ripped right? Make the checkout experience as smooth as possible. Why upset people when they\u2019re about to pay you? This is the moment you\u2019ve been working towards. Make it as pleasant as possible for you and them. ALWAYS thank the customer. Always say goodbye. IF you like them, shake their hand and get their name. Start trying to remember names. Remember your tables and learn from your mistakes. Write everything down. Staples sells 7$ leather notebooks 80pages and no ink will ever bleed. Get a nice pen. Don\u2019t lose it. Write shit down. You might feel weird and people might make fun of you formit. Fuck em. You\u2019re showing you\u2019re serious about the job and the learning part of it. Review the notebook nightly. Write people\u2019s orders down if you get their names. Write down their jobs and when they were in. Make them regulars. \n\nDon\u2019t lose your shit. The night MUST keep moving. If you need help just ask. If you lose your shit you\u2019ll be known as that guy. Be nice to everyone. They are prejudiced against servers. Get them drinks. Take out their trash. Put their needs before yours. You\u2019ll be surprised. It\u2019s Saturday night, 730 pm, 2/3turns of your restaurant. You just got triple sat. You have 7 tables. You need the host to get drinks for one table while you fix an order for another. You need the kitchen to remake something on the fly, you forgot it was a gluten allergy to the pizza bites. What a joke. Two tables are waiting to pay and you don\u2019t remember the last time you felt the urge to do anything other than drink water and smoke a cig. You haven\u2019t peed in 3 hours and won\u2019t for another 3. Smile. People like you. The kitchen makes your order in record time. The table is watered and happy. You drop off the food, drop two checks, greet your table, and get the order from another one. You got this. But you have to front load with people to buy yourself this power. \n\nGood luck! Enjoy your job. Have fun and stay safe. \nPeace",

            "body": "The most basic thing I learned when I first started serving was to do as many things as possible(within reason) with every trip you make around the restaurant. I could clock 9 miles in a brunch shift at a very lengthy saloon I worked in my teens. Getting one extra order, or one extra request each trip will cumulatively save you so. much. time. There's no stressing this enough.\n\nIf you get in the weeds, breath.\n\nIf someones an asshole, kill them with kindness in a manner that other tables can observe. (I've gotten some crazy pity tips this way. \"Wow, that guy was an asshole. You handled that incredibly well.\")\n\nWrite down EVERYTHING, at first. Including names if you've all introduced yourselves. A theory I have is that the thing a person likes hearing the most in this world is their own name. Just don't over-do it. Sometimes I'll even pretend that I forgot their name for the duration of their meal, then when I drop the check I say \"Take your time with this, John. Enjoy your wine. There's absolutely no rush.\" A guy will almost always light up when he realizes that you actually do still remember his name. Oftentimes people even tell me their impressed that I did.\n\nAfter dropping food and making sure you've marked all silverware that may have been removed, ask if you can get them anything else(condiments, fresh-cracked pepper, a new car, etc.).  Within the first two minutes of the patron taking a bite, make sure everything is up to their standards taste-wise. If it's not, you have it remade or comp the item. End of discussion. If the kitchen gets mad at you for this(they probably will) have a manager verbal it next time.\n\nAsk things in a way that encourages conversing, rather than asking a yes or no question. This will engage the guest and make them feel that you are being more personable.\n\nBad example:\n\nServer- \"Does everything taste ok?\n\nGuest- \"Yes.\"\n\nGood example:\n\nServer- \"How is everything over here?\n\nGuest- It's delicious! Best meal we've had in this town yet!\"\n\nSell, sell, sell... sell, sell, sell, sell. Don't push something out of the blue, though. Have a good reason to be selling, or up-selling. Up-selling is when someone orders a salad and you say, \"Would you like to add any protein for a few extra dollars? We have the option to add chicken, beef, shrimp, or lobster.\" Also, with something like lobster be careful with the few extra dollars comment, as it is likely more than just a few extra dollars. If applicable, do this with wine every single time. Doesn't matter, bottle or glass. Know your wine and when they ask for something, if you have the knowledge to back it up, recommend something similar but better.\n\nI'm going to stop here, as life is rushing me now. Last thing, and one of the most important. **Save face with the kitchen. RESPECT THE FUCK OUT OF THEM. WHAT THEY DO IS VERY, VERY HARD.** If you're peddling happiness to people, the kitchen is the middle-man. You shouldn't have much trouble with this(in fact, you're a bit lucky to be moving from the kitchen, as many new servers get shit on by cooks and kitchen staff) Good luck man! And clean-up well. Iron, polish, and shave.\n\nEdit: Wow. Didn't read the subreddit :(. Anyway, I'll leave this here lol I would just comb the hair. It's your call(or rather your employers) whether you choose to shave or not. Many employers stick with the rule that if you have a grown beard, it'll ride, if you don't, shave. Most up-scale places I've served, or bartended at will not let you grow facial hair during the work week. As far as hair, I go with a quick, easy part, as well as some product to de-frizz. IMO a clean-cut, well-groomed appearance is always a better look than leaving it shaggy when it comes to looking as presentable as possible. Sorry for the post :0",

            "body": "I think of a table as a spectrum of time. From the moment they sit to the moment they leave they can behave how they like towards me. A lot of people feel anxiety or just aren\u2019t themselves when they\u2019re hungry. I like to joke with servers having a bad night that a lot of people feel better after a bright smile, enduring patience, hot food, and cold drinks. Don\u2019t fail at any one of these things and you will always be tipped and your priorities will always be set. Keep the drinks full. Take things away that aren\u2019t in use (cluttered tables are uncomfortable.). Say you\u2019re new as long as you fuck up new things. People will be more graceful about it. If my coworkers are crabby to me about their tables still then I smile and say the same thing then offer them snack/water/ibuprofen/cover tables for a smoke break/gum. People aren\u2019t themselves all the time. Take them for their best and trust that they aren\u2019t always their worst. Some people are prejudiced against you. These people won\u2019t be pleased except by being Shitty. Ignore them and smile; the next time you have a table you actually like or that does something kind for you, enjoy it all the more, knowing that shitty person isn\u2019t Jading you and you are wonderful. That shitty person didn\u2019t deserve you. Idk. I love the validation from serving. People 100% aren\u2019t themselves when they\u2019re hungry. Also, you\u2019re trying to get ripped right? Make the checkout experience as smooth as possible. Why upset people when they\u2019re about to pay you? This is the moment you\u2019ve been working towards. Make it as pleasant as possible for you and them. ALWAYS thank the customer. Always say goodbye. IF you like them, shake their hand and get their name. Start trying to remember names. Remember your tables and learn from your mistakes. Write everything down. Staples sells 7$ leather notebooks 80pages and no ink will ever bleed. Get a nice pen. Don\u2019t lose it. Write shit down. You might feel weird and people might make fun of you formit. Fuck em. You\u2019re showing you\u2019re serious about the job and the learning part of it. Review the notebook nightly. Write people\u2019s orders down if you get their names. Write down their jobs and when they were in. Make them regulars. \n\nDon\u2019t lose your shit. The night MUST keep moving. If you need help just ask. If you lose your shit you\u2019ll be known as that guy. Be nice to everyone. They are prejudiced against servers. Get them drinks. Take out their trash. Put their needs before yours. You\u2019ll be surprised. It\u2019s Saturday night, 730 pm, 2/3turns of your restaurant. You just got triple sat. You have 7 tables. You need the host to get drinks for one table while you fix an order for another. You need the kitchen to remake something on the fly, you forgot it was a gluten allergy to the pizza bites. What a joke. Two tables are waiting to pay and you don\u2019t remember the last time you felt the urge to do anything other than drink water and smoke a cig. You haven\u2019t peed in 3 hours and won\u2019t for another 3. Smile. People like you. The kitchen makes your order in record time. The table is watered and happy. You drop off the food, drop two checks, greet your table, and get the order from another one. You got this. But you have to front load with people to buy yourself this power. \n\nGood luck! Enjoy your job. Have fun and stay safe. \nPeace",
