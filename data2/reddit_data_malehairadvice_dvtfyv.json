I'm mixed caucasian/Filipino for context, and my hair is down to my nose on top, and sides taper from about 2\" down to about .5\"\n\n1. Out of the shower, towel dry as much as possible and apply volumizing mousse to ONLY the long hair on top\n\n2. Comb the hair on the sides down and back (my asian hair still wants to stick up)\n\n3. Comb the hair on top straight back. It might want to part on it's own, but you can guide where you want it to set\n\n4. Let it air dry a bit, then set it (and fix the flyaways) with hair spray.\n\nOnce it's dry, you can use your hands to brush the ends to the sides of your head, instead of straight back. But you need to make sure the roots are \"set\" going back or else you won't have any volume.\n\nIf you need extra hold, you can put something light in before coming it back in step 3.",
