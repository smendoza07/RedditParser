I personally think you could use a marine salt water (not common salt) and olive oil or coconut oil (just a couple of drops) solution in a spray bottle, you shake it and spray; the oil will react with the alkali nature of sea water, building up a protective coat that reinforce the hair, gives volume and depending of the amount of oil if will create that post shower look.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSea salt is usually sold dry so you make a diluted solution, more diluted than normal sea water... maybe a tea spoon per liter and half of tap water. Salt water reduce acidity and due to its complex composition allows moisturize you scalp (which is more important) and to protect you hair from oxidation. \n\nI don't have as much hair as you but I'm quite coarse as well at it works pretty well. This is actually a variation of a traditional technique Arabian women use, they keep that spray bottle with them when they are out, this also protects UV radiation damage.",

Leaves the hair shiny, keeps it looking wet, and the hair feels soft with a light hold but no crunchy feeling. \n\nSide note: oils and leave in conditioners will only weigh the hair down and will look greasy instead of wet. Oils are mostly used to add shine, soften hair, and some are meant to repair the hair. Leave ins are designed for brushing out tangles, repairing damaged hair, and taming frizz. They both will ultimately dry into the hair instead of keeping the wet structure.",

Also if it\u2019s in a tin; a white paste will not be shiny but a clear or semi opaque paste will have a gloss like finish.
