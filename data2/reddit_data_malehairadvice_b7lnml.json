Before the cut the hair on the top was maybe 6 inches at the front and shorter as it went back. Sides were maybe 3 inches. After the cut it's about 4 inches on top and a #4 clipper on the sides with a bit of a taper/fade. Before the cut I was styling it as sort of a parted slick back. After the cut it's more of a textured quiff/fauxhawk hybrid. I actually just got out of hospital after a night in the ER but I'll try to take some photos later for you.",
