Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

It would be the only one in the series with no counter.\n\nYou can't have all powerful weapons in a story because it would wreck it. Naruto tries to work around this by just having it be used rarely like how Rinne Rebirth was only used once by Nagato. The eyes weren't depleted or anything. Sasuke said he'd stop if Naruto brought his clan back to life which would be no problem. Just visit Konan and done. Could even use a zetsu as the sacrifice like how black zetsu used Obito to bring back Madara fully except Obito didn't even die thanks to him.\n\nThe only reason Itachi's only worked every decade was to explain away why he didn't use it sooner.

Koharu said they had to kill them because they'd usurp their power, not because Fugaku was going to be a bad leader.\n\nI hope what happens is Sarada and Boruto accidentally find out about Itachi and that he was ordered to kill the Uchiha clan. Sarada decides to kill them but Boruto knocks her out and does it himself so she can still become Hokage and keep her from hating the rest of the village. And after that become a rogue ninja.",

Itachi didn't hold back, the 24 hours of watching his family be killed again and again essentially cemented Sasuke on the path to Orochimaru. It fully jumpstarted his hatred after having it nearly saved. Naruto growing was a different kind of feeling, one that made him arguably more likely to stay and continue their rivalry, but when Itachi hit him with the tsukuyomi those feelings of rivalry shifted to compounded inadequacy. If Sasuke had never come face to face with Itachi, or at the very least hadn't been tsukuyomi'd back to the worst day of his life on a 24 hour loop, I don't think he would have left the village willingly. Now, the Sound 4 still would have captured him and forced him to come, and without the meeting with Sakura setting everyone off early I don't think they would have been stopped in time. So I don't see a scenario where Sasuke is convinced to stay.",

He killed Rin because she didn't want to destroy their home.\n\nHe lost his father, because his father did the right thing.\n\nI think the strongest arguement for Sasuke would have maybe been Guy. If Kakashi had explained his original annoyance and disregard for him, seeing him as a failure and a bother, it would have directly connected with his own feelings about Naruto. And then going on to explain how he and Guy always pushed each other to be better, and became best friends. I think that most of all would have connected.

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

No one really talked about how important dealing with Itachi was for him, and he very clearly felt it was a one-man mission for him. If they made it a goal that they\u2019d help him track him or something, and help him learn new skills to take him down, I think he would have wanted to stay. It would have been easier to help him understand the value of team work if he felt that those values would actually be able to really help _him_ out, to, as he felt staying was holding him back.\n\nThe other big thing was if there was a better way to deal with the curse mark. The main reason he left as I remember had more to do with wanting to deal and use his curse mark than the desire to ditch his friends.",

But, sometimes, even doing most things right- hashirama and madara-you can't always save the ones you love from suffering, and so they may become the very things they fought so hard to destroy. Sasuke becoming a menece like his brother he trained years to righteously destroy, or madara becoming the very opposite of wht he truly wanted-peace. he brought chaos and doom to so many. i think the series shows well tht some ppl have to learn the hard way before they have understanding.",

Had Naruto known about it day one, Kakashi coulda taken miss perfect chakra control and started her on learning med jutsu at the hospital and genjutsu from him, used a stronger Naruto to help Sasuke awaken his sharingan, He coulda trained sasuke better, taught his own SENSEI'S SON the Rasengan, taught naruto elemental Jutsu for all elements cause shadow clone, when Orochifucknugget tried to jump them, the gang woulda been WAY stronger, the Akatsuki woulda been fucked, and they'da never captured all the Tailed Beasts in the first place.",

Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

It would be the only one in the series with no counter.\n\nYou can't have all powerful weapons in a story because it would wreck it. Naruto tries to work around this by just having it be used rarely like how Rinne Rebirth was only used once by Nagato. The eyes weren't depleted or anything. Sasuke said he'd stop if Naruto brought his clan back to life which would be no problem. Just visit Konan and done. Could even use a zetsu as the sacrifice like how black zetsu used Obito to bring back Madara fully except Obito didn't even die thanks to him.\n\nThe only reason Itachi's only worked every decade was to explain away why he didn't use it sooner. No other MS ability has that restriction.",

Itachi didn't hold back, the 24 hours of watching his family be killed again and again essentially cemented Sasuke on the path to Orochimaru. It fully jumpstarted his hatred after having it nearly saved. Naruto growing was a different kind of feeling, one that made him arguably more likely to stay and continue their rivalry, but when Itachi hit him with the tsukuyomi those feelings of rivalry shifted to compounded inadequacy. If Sasuke had never come face to face with Itachi, or at the very least hadn't been tsukuyomi'd back to the worst day of his life on a 24 hour loop, I don't think he would have left the village willingly. Now, the Sound 4 still would have captured him and forced him to come, and without the meeting with Sakura setting everyone off early I don't think they would have been stopped in time. So I don't see a scenario where Sasuke is convinced to stay.",

He killed Rin because she didn't want to destroy their home.\n\nHe lost his father, because his father did the right thing.\n\nI think the strongest arguement for Sasuke would have maybe been Guy. If Kakashi had explained his original annoyance and disregard for him, seeing him as a failure and a bother, it would have directly connected with his own feelings about Naruto. And then going on to explain how he and Guy always pushed each other to be better, and became best friends. I think that most of all would have connected.

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

The sannin for all intents and purposes are pretty much out of the picture, well besides orochimaru wanting to destroy the village. \n\nLiterally feel like until the main characters suddenly got buffed, the leaf didn't have much going for it.",

Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

Itachi didn't hold back, the 24 hours of watching his family be killed again and again essentially cemented Sasuke on the path to Orochimaru. It fully jumpstarted his hatred after having it nearly saved. Naruto growing was a different kind of feeling, one that made him arguably more likely to stay and continue their rivalry, but when Itachi hit him with the tsukuyomi those feelings of rivalry shifted to compounded inadequacy. If Sasuke had never come face to face with Itachi, or at the very least hadn't been tsukuyomi'd back to the worst day of his life on a 24 hour loop, I don't think he would have left the village willingly. Now, the Sound 4 still would have captured him and forced him to come, and without the meeting with Sakura setting everyone off early I don't think they would have been stopped in time. So I don't see a scenario where Sasuke is convinced to stay.",

He killed Rin because she didn't want to destroy their home.\n\nHe lost his father, because his father did the right thing.\n\nI think the strongest arguement for Sasuke would have maybe been Guy. If Kakashi had explained his original annoyance and disregard for him, seeing him as a failure and a bother, it would have directly connected with his own feelings about Naruto. And then going on to explain how he and Guy always pushed each other to be better, and became best friends. I think that most of all would have connected.

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

Itachi didn't hold back, the 24 hours of watching his family be killed again and again essentially cemented Sasuke on the path to Orochimaru. It fully jumpstarted his hatred after having it nearly saved. Naruto growing was a different kind of feeling, one that made him arguably more likely to stay and continue their rivalry, but when Itachi hit him with the tsukuyomi those feelings of rivalry shifted to compounded inadequacy. If Sasuke had never come face to face with Itachi, or at the very least hadn't been tsukuyomi'd back to the worst day of his life on a 24 hour loop, I don't think he would have left the village willingly. Now, the Sound 4 still would have captured him and forced him to come, and without the meeting with Sakura setting everyone off early I don't think they would have been stopped in time. So I don't see a scenario where Sasuke is convinced to stay.",

Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

Naruto tries to work around this by just having it be used rarely like how Rinne Rebirth was only used once by Nagato. The eyes weren't depleted or anything. Sasuke said he'd stop if Naruto brought his clan back to life which would be no problem. Just visit Konan and done.

He asked Sasuke to help him create a future where children dont have to suffer like they did and where hatred doesnt exist between people of different clans or villages. \n\n>and most importantly stop the practice of child soldiers and making it optional to be a shinobi\n\nHe did that. In Boruto, its optional to be a shinobi. Your obsession with Sasuke is making you blind to every other character's intentions and motivations.",

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

The sannin for all intents and purposes are pretty much out of the picture, well besides orochimaru wanting to destroy the village. \n\nLiterally feel like until the main characters suddenly got buffed, the leaf didn't have much going for it.",

Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

Naruto tries to work around this by just having it be used rarely like how Rinne Rebirth was only used once by Nagato. The eyes weren't depleted or anything. Sasuke said he'd stop if Naruto brought his clan back to life which would be no problem. Just visit Konan and done. Could even use a zetsu as the sacrifice like how black zetsu used Obito to bring back Madara fully except Obito didn't even die thanks to him.\n\nThe only reason Itachi's only worked every decade was to explain away why he didn't use it sooner.

He asked Sasuke to help him create a future where children dont have to suffer like they did and where hatred doesnt exist between people of different clans or villages. \n\n>and most importantly stop the practice of child soldiers and making it optional to be a shinobi\n\nHe did that. In Boruto, its optional to be a shinobi. Your obsession with Sasuke is making you blind to every other character's intentions and motivations.",

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

Naruto tries to work around this by just having it be used rarely like how Rinne Rebirth was only used once by Nagato. The eyes weren't depleted or anything. Sasuke said he'd stop if Naruto brought his clan back to life which would be no problem. Just visit Konan and done.

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

Also captured all the tailed beasts even though Kurama was forced against his will to attack him and keeping the jinchuriki in the village was dangerous.\n\nTobirama mostly angered the Uchiha as far as we know. Hiruzen was apathetic towards the village's internal conflicts and didn't do anything about the Hyuga leaders torturing its members. Minato committed suicide because he didn't want to live without Kushina. She asked him to seal Kurama in her again so she'd die with him but didn't know that would actually keep her alive.\n\nThe Senju just never got mentioned again though. We don't know what actually happened to them. People have theorized they just dropped their clan name and married into other clans but I think that's stupid.\n\nAnd I think it's more likely the Hyuga branches assasinate the leader or have someone else do it than the leader killing them all though.",

Then instead of killing taunade they just destroyed everyone she was attached to to make her leave since she was who she was.

Naruto tries to work around this by just having it be used rarely like how Rinne Rebirth was only used once by Nagato. The eyes weren't depleted or anything. Sasuke said he'd stop if Naruto brought his clan back to life which would be no problem. Just visit Konan and done. Could even use a zetsu as the sacrifice like how black zetsu used Obito to bring back Madara fully except Obito didn't even die thanks to him.\n\nThe only reason Itachi's only worked every decade was to explain away why he didn't use it sooner.

He asked Sasuke to help him create a future where children dont have to suffer like they did and where hatred doesnt exist between people of different clans or villages. \n\n>and most importantly stop the practice of child soldiers and making it optional to be a shinobi\n\nHe did that. In Boruto, its optional to be a shinobi. Your obsession with Sasuke is making you blind to every other character's intentions and motivations.",

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",

The point of Shippuden at the end was to leave all the past wars behind and move towards a new future. Telling villagers about the Uchiha Massacre wouldn't have done anyone any good. It would have created unnecessary fear and tension among the villagers. \n\n>I am not obsessed with sasuke\n\nYour username says otherwise.\n\n>and we can see in boruto there are still child aoldiers who are sent to dangerous missions\n\n\nThey are sent only if they wish to. Except Boruto's team no other characters have gone on any dangerous missions. Also, Boruto series has a lot of flaws so I will not try to defend it at all. I myself dislike it. It changed Naruto's character completely. Naruto would have never forgotten the Hidden Rain Village after everything that happened with him and Nagato. Thats just shit writing.",
