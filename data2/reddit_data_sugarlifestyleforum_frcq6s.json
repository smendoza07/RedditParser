    "body": "I had a road trip a week ago & it poured rain on my drive home. He checked on me throughout my drive & was as always, very concerned about me being on the road solo. My tires lost contact with the road momentarily during the drive, I knew immediately new tires, CRAP. At one of my road stops, texted him where I was at & what happened during the last stage of drive. He immediately responds to find the tires this week & he'll help cover so I don't delay \"I want you safe at all times\". He sent my normal allowance + enough to almost cover another allowance to help with my tires. I'm in an essential care industry, so thankfully I still work, but my funds are tighter than before with my stocks down (He helped me invest & I'm confident it will bounce back) & bonuses at work gone until we can all resume somewhat normal life. A big huge thank you to all SD's helping out, even when they have their own financial bumps going on. Makes your SB know how much you appreciate what we bring into these relationships! \ud83e\udd8b Mine will get an extra special thank you once I'm able to ravage him again \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude09",
