    "body": "I\u2019ve found a great SB for the past several months. I often end up buying little things for her when I head over to her place to hang out. \n\nToday, before I head out the door, she texts me to pick up a couple of things at Bath and Body Works. Sure I say to myself. I\u2019ve done it before. \n\nI drive up to the closest one and there is a line out the door. I go online to try and order and have them deliver to my car but the website has crashed. \n\nAfter some deliberation, I manned up and got in line. In the cold. With about 50 women. \n\nAs I was in line, I started to gather that there was something called a candle sale. Women were getting containers which could hold 18 candles a piece! I made my way to the front and the sales lady asked if I was buying any candles today. I said, \u201cnot today.\u201d  This was met by some of the most intense heckles from the women behind me \ud83d\ude05. \n\nI ended up buying a couple of candles for my SB along with her other requests and was out the door in under three minutes, leaving the 21 other women who were allowed in the store (due to Covid) to their day of 5-wick heaven. \n\nWhile this was not an experience I\u2019d ever repeat, my dedication was rewarded when I got to her door!",
