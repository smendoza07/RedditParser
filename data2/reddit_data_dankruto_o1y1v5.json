Was Gaara also on a clown path? \n\nSasuke held it together pretty well for being tortured that way. Before he learned about Danzo, he prevented Suigetsu from killing anyone, refused to kill Orochimaru's shinobi even though he asked him to, refused to kill Karin's prisoners and later released them (she actually started killing them once word of Orochimaru being gone spread). Oh and he neutralized Orochimaru.",

Granted, Gaara was horrifically abused as a child; but, no matter how it was tailored, he still wore a clown suit for a while. \n\n As soon as Gaara had some sense knocked into him, he pulled a 180 on the psychopathic murder train. He realized he actually liked his siblings, realized he could build friendships to combat loneliness, and realized he could cooperate with Shukaku through kindness. \n\nAs for your analysis of Sasuke's path, I agree generally with your take. But I think it's notable that Sasuke tried to kill Naruto on several occasions before finding out about Danzo. First when he dueled Naruto on the rooftop (dude used a goddamn chidori, a murder technique); second when he almost used his Karin technique on Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Yamato (Orochimaru tells him not to go through with it because it would destroy the entire hideout).",

Sasuke was already triggered by Naruto's progress and reacted by using chidori. I think Kakashi said Naruto would've killed Sasuke if he didn't arrive in time. \n\nRest is true. I have always wondered how much influence the curse-seal had over Sasuke after he took the medicine. I feel like the writer didn't explore the curse-mark much. People would be more sympathetic to Naruto's quest of wanting Sasuke back if it was more clear that the CS was affecting his mind.",

That's why they should have been sympathetic towards that.\n\nHe also knew there was more to the story once Itachi gave him the crow but wasn't able to put it together. Once Obito tells him the truth he wants to save him even more because he understands why he got to this point.\n\nSasuke would be justified in destroying the village since they did the same thing to people closest to him, but it's obviously not good.\n\nThe Uchiha were justified in attempting a coup too because Danzo entraped them, they were also in existential danger already because Shisui was extremely loyal and Danzo killed him anyway.",

Kakashi's faults make him a good character, but, from the point of view of Sasuke, dude is a washed up nobody.\n\nWhich is good for his (Kakashi) character arc, realizing his faults and growing and taking things more serious, but for the perception people have of him within the world? It's going to make him look really, really, bad. \n\nIf Sakura or Naruto took things more serious, they would have been pissed at Kakashi too.",

Sasuke should've had more time under Kakashi and in the village to actually show he waa friends with the Konoha 11.\n\nI personally think Sasuke should've left at 16, have the time skip be a year and then end the war on Naruto's 18th birthday.",

All of his problems stem from deluded morons (Danzo, Madara, Obito) who think they were saving the world and the \"system\" was wrong. Sasuke acted just like them.\n\nSasuke's anger is understandable but his final mindset was so random and stupid. It's like he learnt absolutely nothing. And he randomly changed his mind in the end.",

Before he learned about Danzo, he prevented Suigetsu from killing anyone, refused to kill Orochimaru's shinobi even though he asked him to, refused to kill Karin's prisoners and later released them (she actually started killing them once word of Orochimaru being gone spread). Oh and he neutralized Orochimaru.",

Granted, Gaara was horrifically abused as a child; but, no matter how it was tailored, he still wore a clown suit for a while. \n\n As soon as Gaara had some sense knocked into him, he pulled a 180 on the psychopathic murder train. He realized he actually liked his siblings, realized he could build friendships to combat loneliness, and realized he could cooperate with Shukaku through kindness. \n\nAs for your analysis of Sasuke's path, I agree generally with your take. But I think it's notable that Sasuke tried to kill Naruto on several occasions before finding out about Danzo. First when he dueled Naruto on the rooftop (dude used a goddamn chidori, a murder technique); second when he almost used his Karin technique on Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Yamato (Orochimaru tells him not to go through with it because it would destroy the entire hideout).",

That's why they should have been sympathetic towards that.\n\nHe also knew there was more to the story once Itachi gave him the crow but wasn't able to put it together.

It makes zero sense that Naruto and Sakura would be so dedicated to bringing Sasuke back considering the fact they've only actually been friends with him for a couple months. The way they act you'd think they shared a crib together.\n\nThe Sasuke retrieval arc in canon is literally a bunch of 12-13 year olds almost dying for some guy they're not even really friends with. Sasuke should've had more time under Kakashi and in the village to actually show he waa friends with the Konoha 11.\n\nI personally think Sasuke should've left at 16, have the time skip be a year and then end the war on Naruto's 18th birthday.",

Granted, Gaara was horrifically abused as a child; but, no matter how it was tailored, he still wore a clown suit for a while. \n\n As soon as Gaara had some sense knocked into him, he pulled a 180 on the psychopathic murder train. He realized he actually liked his siblings, realized he could build friendships to combat loneliness, and realized he could cooperate with Shukaku through kindness. \n\nAs for your analysis of Sasuke's path, I agree generally with your take. But I think it's notable that Sasuke tried to kill Naruto on several occasions before finding out about Danzo. First when he dueled Naruto on the rooftop (dude used a goddamn chidori, a murder technique); second when he almost used his Karin technique on Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Yamato (Orochimaru tells him not to go through with it because it would destroy the entire hideout).",

I have always wondered how much influence the curse-seal had over Sasuke after he took the medicine. I feel like the writer didn't explore the curse-mark much.

That's why they should have been sympathetic towards that.\n\nHe also knew there was more to the story once Itachi gave him the crow but wasn't able to put it together. Once Obito tells him the truth he wants to save him even more because he understands why he got to this point.\n\nSasuke would be justified in destroying the village since they did the same thing to people closest to him, but it's obviously not good.\n\nThe Uchiha were justified in attempting a coup too because Danzo entraped them, they were also in existential danger already because Shisui was extremely loyal and Danzo killed him anyway.",

He realized he actually liked his siblings, realized he could build friendships to combat loneliness, and realized he could cooperate with Shukaku through kindness. \n\nAs for your analysis of Sasuke's path, I agree generally with your take. But I think it's notable that Sasuke tried to kill Naruto on several occasions before finding out about Danzo. First when he dueled Naruto on the rooftop (dude used a goddamn chidori, a murder technique); second when he almost used his Karin technique on Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Yamato (Orochimaru tells him not to go through with it because it would destroy the entire hideout).",
