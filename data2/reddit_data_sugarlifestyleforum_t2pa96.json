It\u2019s a waste of money for them (if they even know about SA) let alone an embarrassment. \n\nFind you a young tech guy entrepreneur you can befriend and hang out with. He\u2019s always networking to grow his capital and most often partnering with older more established high net worth business men. When he goes out, go out with him. Look your best\u2014stand out like money. Talk about entrepreneurship, current events, politics, and express wanting to learn more about increasing your capacity. \n\nAfter a while, you will find yourself in business conversations with success sprinkled with some cat and mouse chasing. \n\nWith whales, they don\u2019t \u201cseek\u201d arrangements. They seek beautiful intelligent women who are hungry for success and drive to make a way for themselves. They will provide/sponsor you to help you grow your capacity. They will remove impediments to make your path easier. What they\u2019re doing is investing in you FOR A PURPOSE AND OUTCOME that has nothing to do with accumulation of purses. \n\nSource: My personal experiences with bonafide whales.",

The main thing in this post that I found to be true with this particular whale is the part that they will provide/sponsor you. My SD pretty much made it clear he wants me to start going to college while we're together and he'll take care of me so I can focus on it 100%. This is the first time a SD presented me with that option. I can't speak about where to find whales because finding him was absolute luck and devine timing.",

            "body": "I've been around some extraordinarily wealthy tech people.  Some of my business partners are at $100M+ net worth.  The main guy I know that engaged in this lifestyle indeed did not use SA.  However, I wouldn't say that he was trying to find women who are \"hungry for success,\" in fact I'd say that he purposely shied away from such women after sleeping with them a few times.\n\nGenerally speaking...the women he came across were intentionally hanging around in areas and social circles where they knew they'd meet wealthy men.  His approach was to walk around with a $60K, very flashy watch with lots of diamonds on it.  This got women - at least those who are impressed by such things - to at least listen to what he had to say. He is quite an extrovert, which is why he didn't use sites like SA.  I wouldn't say that he avoided it specifically because he would have been embarrassed by it, though he did have a security clearance because of one of his other businesses, so that might have influenced his decision.\n\nHere are the ones I recall and how they met:\n\n1. He dated a Hooter's waitress, that he met at...Hooter's.  She was probably the most genuine of the bunch.  If she were seeking wealthy men, Hooter's probably wouldn't be the first choice.\n2. He dated 2 real estate agents.  One sold him a house and was constantly working in the circle of wealthy men in their city, and had no qualms about using her sex appeal to move up in the world.  The second one cold-emailed him trying to get him to buy a house, knowing that he lived in a $12M house, and had her professional-but-suggestive picture in the signature of the email.  I got to know her relatively well, and she admitted that she had been cold-emailing wealthy men in the area for months, hoping for either high end home sales or a relationship with a wealthy man - whatever would improve her life.\n3. He dated a woman that was half his age who was a software engineer.  He met her at an industry conference. She once told me that she first noticed his watch.  I don't think she was a gold digger, but she was certainly impressed by the watch and then he had enough game to take it from there.\n4. He dated a waitress from an extremely high end hotel restaurant near his home.  He constantly flirted with her whenever we would go there, and she flirted back.  He eventually offered her a job as a personal assistant, and as a broke college student, she took it.  It wasn't long before he was sleeping with her and paying some bills (he was 46, she was 20).\n5. He dated someone who turned out to be a Las Vegas stripper, who he met at an extremely high end bar in a sleepy but very wealthy city in Southern California.  She was also there intentionally trying to find wealthy men.\n6. He dated (and eventually married) another woman that was half his age (23 at the time) at another industry conference.  I was there and initially flirted with her, then introduced her to him, and she basically ignored me after seeing his watch.  She was 100% seeking the wealthiest man she could find, and slept with him the first night despite the fact that she was married to someone else at the time.  They are still married, however he constantly cheats on her with other women.\n\nSo I wouldn't say that whales are looking for driven women or even those that are that intelligent.  They date and help attractive women that enter their field of vision in one way or another, and because \"normal\" people aren't usually in those areas/social circles, those tend to be women that are there for the specific purpose of finding a wealthy man.\n\nLong story short, if you're looking for a \"whale\"...be hot, young, and flirty and hang out or work in areas where wealthy men are.  Then shoot your shot with as many as you can, and you'll likely wind up in some form of relationship, SR or otherwise, with a whale.",

These conferences often had a mix of bank executives, tech executives from the software companies trying to sell to the banks, and lower level sales/tech people actually working the exhibition booths. Both of the women he wound up with from conferences were there working booths for their companies, but the hotel bars at these conferences were also full of women looking to hook up with wealthy men.  So if you\u2019re looking at that angle, look for conferences/conventions in your area that would attract top executives in whatever field.  The smaller and more exclusive the conference, the better.  Go hang at a hotel bar there during prime time for a day or two.\n\nAs far as where they hang out under normal circumstances, think bars and restaurants in very wealthy areas.  Not necessarily tourist zones\u2026like places that someone who lives in the area would go.  If you\u2019re attractive enough, merely being in these places and paying attention to what the men hitting on your are wearing/driving/whatever, you can pretty easily wind up with a rich guy.\n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t entirely discount the idea that you will find a whale online, even on SA. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to someone you can identify as being very wealthy, whatever the platform.  I know a handful of wealthy men that have dated women they met through LinkedIn.  Just post a picture that is hot but appropriate for the platform (bikini is great on IG, not so much on LinkedIn..etc), and reach out.",

There were those who sought  assistance in both economic and spiritual support  to make an exponential advance in both their economic situation and their career path that were irresistible and for whom the allowance was not an expense but rather an investment . \n\nOne completed her BS and went on to her MD and a successful career on the strength of her character and some sugar applied at a critical point in her struggle.

Sure there have been SD for 100 years, but sugar relationships were just vanilla relationships with a large age gap and a major wealth disparity.  A sugar baby was nothing more then a spoiled GF of an older wealthy man no matter if that relationship was committed or casual. They were both dating up.  I\u2019m pretty sure that the modern sugar arrangement created by Seeking is what allowed sugar relationships to become more like sex work rather than a dating relationship. To me, Seeking is moving away from being a sugar arrangement site and more towards the original concept of sugar where it was an actual relationship.",

However, while your method will indeed get you more in the long run it will fail for nearly all SBs and leave them fucked with little to nothing to show for it. By nearly all I mean 998/1000.\n\nI will agree that trying to find a more traditional arrangement will indeed net bigger returns long term for you, but there is also the risk of getting absolutely nothing.

Not about freestyling or whales in particular, but about being ambitious with your dating and making a higher than average attempt at working towards your goal as opposed to hoping it falls into your lap because of beauty standards.\n\nUsing online resources is a low effort form of dating that somehow always ends up costing users more effort overall churning through falsely advertised personalities represented by both sides of the gender spectrum.\n\nMost wealthy men will have a natural inclination towards women who have a sense of ambition surrounding them.  It falls into the 'show me, don't tell me' spectrum.  A woman can claim ambition on a dating profile, but women who are genuinely ambitious in their relationships are putting in ground work in the real world to reach their goals.\n\nIt's extremely close to education and career in that way.  You put in the effort for the education but never the effort for the real life experience in the career field.  Now you're sitting in a bunch of college debt working as a barista, pissed off at a broken educational system that somehow works for other people, but not you and wondering why.",

I asked her how she was going to play it, and she said \"you don't bring up money with guys like this, you make it so he adores you and just does it on his own\".  So based on my huge sample size of one \ud83e\udd23 , I don't think \"freestyle a whale\" and \"I don't do anything for free\" are compatible philosophies.   This is similar to what I've read from other SBs who are looking for higher end SRs, things are not explicitly negotiated.  \n\nIt's an interesting topic in that it's a type of SR that isn't super commonly discussed.",

These conferences often had a mix of bank executives, tech executives from the software companies trying to sell to the banks, and lower level sales/tech people actually working the exhibition booths. Both of the women he wound up with from conferences were there working booths for their companies, but the hotel bars at these conferences were also full of women looking to hook up with wealthy men.  So if you\u2019re looking at that angle, look for conferences/conventions in your area that would attract top executives in whatever field.  The smaller and more exclusive the conference, the better.  Go hang at a hotel bar there during prime time for a day or two.\n\nAs far as where they hang out under normal circumstances, think bars and restaurants in very wealthy areas.  Not necessarily tourist zones\u2026like places that someone who lives in the area would go.  If you\u2019re attractive enough, merely being in these places and paying attention to what the men hitting on your are wearing/driving/whatever, you can pretty easily wind up with a rich guy.\n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t entirely discount the idea that you will find a whale online, even on SA. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to someone you can identify as being very wealthy, whatever the platform.  I know a handful of wealthy men that have dated women they met through LinkedIn.  Just post a picture that is hot but appropriate for the platform (bikini is great on IG, not so much on LinkedIn..etc), and reach out.",

Sure there have been SD for 100 years, but sugar relationships were just vanilla relationships with a large age gap and a major wealth disparity.  A sugar baby was nothing more then a spoiled GF of an older wealthy man no matter if that relationship was committed or casual. They were both dating up.  I\u2019m pretty sure that the modern sugar arrangement created by Seeking is what allowed sugar relationships to become more like sex work rather than a dating relationship. To me, Seeking is moving away from being a sugar arrangement site and more towards the original concept of sugar where it was an actual relationship.",

However, while your method will indeed get you more in the long run it will fail for nearly all SBs and leave them fucked with little to nothing to show for it. By nearly all I mean 998/1000.\n\nI will agree that trying to find a more traditional arrangement will indeed net bigger returns long term for you, but there is also the risk of getting absolutely nothing.

These conferences often had a mix of bank executives, tech executives from the software companies trying to sell to the banks, and lower level sales/tech people actually working the exhibition booths. Both of the women he wound up with from conferences were there working booths for their companies, but the hotel bars at these conferences were also full of women looking to hook up with wealthy men.  So if you\u2019re looking at that angle, look for conferences/conventions in your area that would attract top executives in whatever field.  The smaller and more exclusive the conference, the better.  Go hang at a hotel bar there during prime time for a day or two.\n\nAs far as where they hang out under normal circumstances, think bars and restaurants in very wealthy areas.  Not necessarily tourist zones\u2026like places that someone who lives in the area would go.  If you\u2019re attractive enough, merely being in these places and paying attention to what the men hitting on your are wearing/driving/whatever, you can pretty easily wind up with a rich guy.\n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t entirely discount the idea that you will find a whale online, even on SA. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to someone you can identify as being very wealthy, whatever the platform.  I know a handful of wealthy men that have dated women they met through LinkedIn.  Just post a picture that is hot but appropriate for the platform (bikini is great on IG, not so much on LinkedIn..etc), and reach out.",

Sure there have been SD for 100 years, but sugar relationships were just vanilla relationships with a large age gap and a major wealth disparity.  A sugar baby was nothing more then a spoiled GF of an older wealthy man no matter if that relationship was committed or casual. They were both dating up.  I\u2019m pretty sure that the modern sugar arrangement created by Seeking is what allowed sugar relationships to become more like sex work rather than a dating relationship. To me, Seeking is moving away from being a sugar arrangement site and more towards the original concept of sugar where it was an actual relationship.",

However, while your method will indeed get you more in the long run it will fail for nearly all SBs and leave them fucked with little to nothing to show for it. By nearly all I mean 998/1000.\n\nI will agree that trying to find a more traditional arrangement will indeed net bigger returns long term for you, but there is also the risk of getting absolutely nothing. You are able to navigate that, most SBs need the security of a pre-determined allowance or they won't end up with anything at all.",

Sure there have been SD for 100 years, but sugar relationships were just vanilla relationships with a large age gap and a major wealth disparity.  A sugar baby was nothing more then a spoiled GF of an older wealthy man no matter if that relationship was committed or casual. They were both dating up.  I\u2019m pretty sure that the modern sugar arrangement created by Seeking is what allowed sugar relationships to become more like sex work rather than a dating relationship. To me, Seeking is moving away from being a sugar arrangement site and more towards the original concept of sugar where it was an actual relationship.",
