    "body": "My birthday was marvellous, all thanks to my SD.\nHe took me to South of France for a few days, biggest suite in a luxury hotel, we went to dinner and along some jewellery and two other gifts, he gave me xx,xxx\u00a3 to invest in whatever I want over a few years period. \n\nOur 1-year anniversary is coming soon and I plan to take him horseriding on my dime (he hasn\u2019t been on a horse since he turned 13) with a personalised gift. \n\nToday I told him I may get to study abroad for 6 months and I asked him if he wanted to end it. He said no, we\u2019re in it for the long term. So he\u2019ll come visit me once every month/whenever his job allows him to and there is no change in my allowance despite the huge frequency drop (we see each other 4-8 times a month usually). He isn\u2019t perfect, but our SR pretty much is.",

SD Guy\u2019s net worth is minimum $10-20 million with earned income of at least $500K. More important is the unearned income from investments. 3% of that is at least $300K. So yes there are whale SDs with more net worth and higher income. But OP\u2019s can easily spend $10K a month on her allowance and add more gifts etc., totaling over $150K a year in value to her. OP might bank significantly more than this. We don\u2019t know how generous her SD chose to be in their negotiations but the theoretical capability is extraordinary even if he\u2019s not worth $50 million or more like a \u201ctrue whale\u201d. Extraordinary because 90% or more of SBs look at a few thousand a month, or less than $60K a year. And their SDs have a net worth of less than $10 million.   Don\u2019t think I have broken forum rules in speaking so speculatively and generally with dollar numbers about worth and allowance. However seems to me this kind of info is basic to a realistic understanding of what one can expect in the sugar bowl.  Adding that whale-ish SDs don\u2019t (to repeat posters on here) need to, or hardly ever want to, lavish their SBs with all the coin that they \u201ccould afford\u201d to drop.",

I know where he works and have been to his office multiple times. I also travel with him \u2014when I\u2019m not too busy with college,  for work. So he\u2019ll have his meetings, I\u2019ll be chilling at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es or at the Piazza del Popolo (or wherever he needs to go) and we\u2019ll spend time together in the morning and evening. \n2. He\u2019s \u201cGoogleable\u201d.\n3. I\u2019ve seen some of his tax returns. It was actually accidental, we were chilling in bed and I asked him what he was carrying in his backpack. He said some work documents. I asked if I could take a look, he told me to go ahead. I accidentally picked his personal folder, not the work one and only realised when I saw one of his dividends returns, but I put it back immediately.\n4. He eventually wants children with me, which I don\u2019t, but would I say yes, the following would be put in a contract and revised by a lawyer of my choosing \u2014the lawyer fees would indirectly be paid by him:\n* I get a house, although the usufruit, the nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 will go to the child\n* His wealth will be equally divided amongst the children, with a set trust fund, for which I\u2019ll be responsible for until they turn 18. He\u2019ll live off the dividends his portfolio returns, and leave the rest behind to his children. So that\u2019s 8 figures split amongst 1-3 kids.\n5. He has proposed to move me into one of said properties. I refused because I\u2019d rather live close to campus and like the student experience. \n\nFree of you not to believe me!",

More important is the unearned income from investments. 3% of that is at least $300K. So yes there are whale SDs with more net worth and higher income. But OP\u2019s can easily spend $10K a month on her allowance and add more gifts etc., totaling over $150K a year in value to her. OP might bank significantly more than this. We don\u2019t know how generous her SD chose to be in their negotiations but the theoretical capability is extraordinary even if he\u2019s not worth $50 million or more like a \u201ctrue whale\u201d. Extraordinary because 90% or more of SBs look at a few thousand a month, or less than $60K a year. And their SDs have a net worth of less than $10 million.   Don\u2019t think I have broken forum rules in speaking so speculatively and generally with dollar numbers about worth and allowance. However seems to me this kind of info is basic to a realistic understanding of what one can expect in the sugar bowl.  Adding that whale-ish SDs don\u2019t (to repeat posters on here) need to, or hardly ever want to, lavish their SBs with all the coin that they \u201ccould afford\u201d to drop.",

He said some work documents. I asked if I could take a look, he told me to go ahead. I accidentally picked his personal folder, not the work one and only realised when I saw one of his dividends returns, but I put it back immediately.\n4. He eventually wants children with me, which I don\u2019t, but would I say yes, the following would be put in a contract and revised by a lawyer of my choosing \u2014the lawyer fees would indirectly be paid by him:\n* I get a house, although the usufruit, the nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 will go to the child\n* His wealth will be equally divided amongst the children, with a set trust fund, for which I\u2019ll be responsible for until they turn 18. He\u2019ll live off the dividends his portfolio returns, and leave the rest behind to his children. So that\u2019s 8 figures split amongst 1-3 kids.\n5.

He wants the long-lasting romance, the passion, the Josephine to his Napol\u00e9on. We happen to have amazing chemistry, which he says is rare for him.\n3. This might be controversial and I\u2019m aware the SDs won\u2019t like this but I think an SR is more likely to work if the SD is more into the SB than vice-versa.

More important is the unearned income from investments. 3% of that is at least $300K. So yes there are whale SDs with more net worth and higher income. But OP\u2019s can easily spend $10K a month on her allowance and add more gifts etc., totaling over $150K a year in value to her. OP might bank significantly more than this. We don\u2019t know how generous her SD chose to be in their negotiations but the theoretical capability is extraordinary even if he\u2019s not worth $50 million or more like a \u201ctrue whale\u201d. Extraordinary because 90% or more of SBs look at a few thousand a month, or less than $60K a year. And their SDs have a net worth of less than $10 million.   Don\u2019t think I have broken forum rules in speaking so speculatively and generally with dollar numbers about worth and allowance. However seems to me this kind of info is basic to a realistic understanding of what one can expect in the sugar bowl.  Adding that whale-ish SDs don\u2019t (to repeat posters on here) need to, or hardly ever want to, lavish their SBs with all the coin that they \u201ccould afford\u201d to drop.",

He said some work documents. I asked if I could take a look, he told me to go ahead. I accidentally picked his personal folder, not the work one and only realised when I saw one of his dividends returns, but I put it back immediately.\n4. He eventually wants children with me, which I don\u2019t, but would I say yes, the following would be put in a contract and revised by a lawyer of my choosing \u2014the lawyer fees would indirectly be paid by him:\n* I get a house, although the usufruit, the nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 will go to the child\n* His wealth will be equally divided amongst the children, with a set trust fund, for which I\u2019ll be responsible for until they turn 18. He\u2019ll live off the dividends his portfolio returns, and leave the rest behind to his children. So that\u2019s 8 figures split amongst 1-3 kids.\n5.

More important is the unearned income from investments. 3% of that is at least $300K. So yes there are whale SDs with more net worth and higher income. But OP\u2019s can easily spend $10K a month on her allowance and add more gifts etc., totaling over $150K a year in value to her. OP might bank significantly more than this. We don\u2019t know how generous her SD chose to be in their negotiations but the theoretical capability is extraordinary even if he\u2019s not worth $50 million or more like a \u201ctrue whale\u201d. Extraordinary because 90% or more of SBs look at a few thousand a month, or less than $60K a year. And their SDs have a net worth of less than $10 million.   Don\u2019t think I have broken forum rules in speaking so speculatively and generally with dollar numbers about worth and allowance. However seems to me this kind of info is basic to a realistic understanding of what one can expect in the sugar bowl.  Adding that whale-ish SDs don\u2019t (to repeat posters on here) need to, or hardly ever want to, lavish their SBs with all the coin that they \u201ccould afford\u201d to drop.",

I also travel with him \u2014when I\u2019m not too busy with college,  for work. So he\u2019ll have his meetings, I\u2019ll be chilling at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es or at the Piazza del Popolo (or wherever he needs to go) and we\u2019ll spend time together in the morning and evening. \n2. He\u2019s \u201cGoogleable\u201d.\n3. I\u2019ve seen some of his tax returns. It was actually accidental, we were chilling in bed and I asked him what he was carrying in his backpack. He said some work documents. I asked if I could take a look, he told me to go ahead. I accidentally picked his personal folder, not the work one and only realised when I saw one of his dividends returns, but I put it back immediately.\n4. He eventually wants children with me, which I don\u2019t, but would I say yes, the following would be put in a contract and revised by a lawyer of my choosing \u2014the lawyer fees would indirectly be paid by him:\n* I get a house, although the usufruit, the nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 will go to the child\n* His wealth will be equally divided amongst the children, with a set trust fund, for which I\u2019ll be responsible for until they turn 18. He\u2019ll live off the dividends his portfolio returns, and leave the rest behind to his children. So that\u2019s 8 figures split amongst 1-3 kids.\n5. He has proposed to move me into one of said properties. I refused because I\u2019d rather live close to campus and like the student experience. \n\nFree of you not to believe me!",

So he\u2019ll have his meetings, I\u2019ll be chilling at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es or at the Piazza del Popolo (or wherever he needs to go) and we\u2019ll spend time together in the morning and evening. \n2. He\u2019s \u201cGoogleable\u201d.\n3. I\u2019ve seen some of his tax returns. It was actually accidental, we were chilling in bed and I asked him what he was carrying in his backpack. He said some work documents. I asked if I could take a look, he told me to go ahead. I accidentally picked his personal folder, not the work one and only realised when I saw one of his dividends returns, but I put it back immediately.\n4. He eventually wants children with me, which I don\u2019t, but would I say yes, the following would be put in a contract and revised by a lawyer of my choosing \u2014the lawyer fees would indirectly be paid by him:\n* I get a house, although the usufruit, the nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 will go to the child\n* His wealth will be equally divided amongst the children, with a set trust fund, for which I\u2019ll be responsible for until they turn 18. He\u2019ll live off the dividends his portfolio returns, and leave the rest behind to his children. So that\u2019s 8 figures split amongst 1-3 kids.\n5. He has proposed to move me into one of said properties. I refused because I\u2019d rather live close to campus and like the student experience. \n\nFree of you not to believe me!",

I also travel with him \u2014when I\u2019m not too busy with college,  for work. So he\u2019ll have his meetings, I\u2019ll be chilling at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es or at the Piazza del Popolo (or wherever he needs to go) and we\u2019ll spend time together in the morning and evening. \n2. He\u2019s \u201cGoogleable\u201d.\n3. I\u2019ve seen some of his tax returns. It was actually accidental, we were chilling in bed and I asked him what he was carrying in his backpack. He said some work documents. I asked if I could take a look, he told me to go ahead. I accidentally picked his personal folder, not the work one and only realised when I saw one of his dividends returns, but I put it back immediately.\n4. He eventually wants children with me, which I don\u2019t, but would I say yes, the following would be put in a contract and revised by a lawyer of my choosing \u2014the lawyer fees would indirectly be paid by him:\n* I get a house, although the usufruit, the nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 will go to the child\n* His wealth will be equally divided amongst the children, with a set trust fund, for which I\u2019ll be responsible for until they turn 18. He\u2019ll live off the dividends his portfolio returns, and leave the rest behind to his children. So that\u2019s 8 figures split amongst 1-3 kids.\n5. He has proposed to move me into one of said properties. I refused because I\u2019d rather live close to campus and like the student experience. \n\nFree of you not to believe me!",
