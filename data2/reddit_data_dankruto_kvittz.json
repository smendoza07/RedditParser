It was that line from the Godfather taken to the extreme.\n\n> Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in\n\nFinally he thinks he's going to die blocking one of Kaguya's rods and is happy he and Obito will be able to catch up with Rin. There was unease in his voice when he asks Obito what he did after that.\n\nMan just can't catch a break.",

It was that line from the Godfather taken to the extreme.\n\n> Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in\n\nFinally he thinks he's going to die blocking one of Kaguya's rods and is happy he and Obito will be able to catch up with Rin.
