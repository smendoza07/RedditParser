With athletes, it is a bit tricky. This is totally personal taste, but I haven't like any of the episodes that involved athletes: one during family package, the baseball episode, even the volleyball episodes that most people loved.\n\nI just care that it seems like a big deal and will get attention which is always good for RM. \u263a\ufe0f I can handle a few episodes that are not catered to my taste.

The instagram post of this already has many comments. I don't know good or bad, but it's a lot. Which means, attention and probably a rating boost.",

JSM-YSC saved the show later on, but the early years of RM was unmatched.\n\nNot gonna spoil you, but each ep was so well-crafted in its own way that it makes you want more. The action, the sequences, the humor & the iconic nametag elimination; RM was huge back in the day.\n\nThe fun part is, you can watch how each members develop into their characters & create the chemistry that we see now. Each one of them was unique & contributed significantly to the show.\n\nFor instance, Song Jihyo became a megastar due to how she broke the mold on how an actress is \"supposed to act\" on a variety show, back in the day. She was bold, relentless, cool & efficient in high-intensity games. Your opinion on her will change once you watch the old eps, because post-JSM/YSC Jihyo is vastly different from the Golden Era RM. \n\nAs a RM fan, I cant stress enough that you shld give pre-JSM/YSC a watch.\n\nedit: removed typos",

JSM-YSC saved the show later on, but the early years of RM was unmatched.\n\nNot gonna spoil you, but each ep was so well-crafted in its own way that it makes you want more. The action, the sequences, the humor & the iconic nametag elimination; RM was huge back in the day.\n\nThe fun part is, you can watch how each members develop into their characters & create the chemistry that we see now. Each one of them was unique & contributed significantly to the show.\n\nFor instance, Song Jihyo became a megastar due to how she broke the mold on how an actress is \"supposed to act\" on a variety show, back in the day. She was bold, relentless, cool & efficient in high-intensity games. Your opinion on her will change once you watch the old eps, because post-JSM/YSC Jihyo is vastly different from the Golden Era RM. \n\nAs a RM fan, I cant stress enough that you shld give pre-JSM/YSC a watch.\n\nedit: removed typos",

JSM-YSC saved the show later on, but the early years of RM was unmatched.\n\nNot gonna spoil you, but each ep was so well-crafted in its own way that it makes you want more. The action, the sequences, the humor & the iconic nametag elimination; RM was huge back in the day.\n\nThe fun part is, you can watch how each members develop into their characters & create the chemistry that we see now. Each one of them was unique & contributed significantly to the show.\n\nFor instance, Song Jihyo became a megastar due to how she broke the mold on how an actress is \"supposed to act\" on a variety show, back in the day. She was bold, relentless, cool & efficient in high-intensity games. Your opinion on her will change once you watch the old eps, because post-JSM/YSC Jihyo is vastly different from the Golden Era RM. \n\nAs a RM fan, I cant stress enough that you shld give pre-JSM/YSC a watch.\n\nedit: removed typos",
