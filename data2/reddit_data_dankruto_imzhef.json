It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke. But for the sake of arguing let\u2019s talk about power scaling lol\n\nKaguya was beaten by Naruto and Sasuke only because they had seals given to them by Hagoromo himself which they lost after the war. They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

In one of the recent chapters it was revealed that the seal basically slowly turns him into an otsutsuki, But it's kind of like Orochimaru's cursed seal and the Otsustsuki will take control of the body when the seal fully matures. Or at least that's what normally happens, but Boruto can probably counter it using his Jogan and fully control his transformation.!<\n\n>!We also got a taste of this power in one of the recent chapters when Boruto effortlessly destroyed a Kara member using this transformation. All Kara members were supposed to be as strong as an Otsustsuki, this guy was supposed to be stronger than Delta who gave even Naruto a lot of trouble, and finally this guys was sent to fight Sasuke.

It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke. But for the sake of arguing let\u2019s talk about power scaling lol\n\nKaguya was beaten by Naruto and Sasuke only because they had seals given to them by Hagoromo himself which they lost after the war. They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

In one of the recent chapters it was revealed that the seal basically slowly turns him into an otsutsuki, But it's kind of like Orochimaru's cursed seal and the Otsustsuki will take control of the body when the seal fully matures. Or at least that's what normally happens, but Boruto can probably counter it using his Jogan and fully control his transformation.!<\n\n>!We also got a taste of this power in one of the recent chapters when Boruto effortlessly destroyed a Kara member using this transformation. All Kara members were supposed to be as strong as an Otsustsuki, this guy was supposed to be stronger than Delta who gave even Naruto a lot of trouble, and finally this guys was sent to fight Sasuke. So he wasn't some weakling.!<",

It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke. But for the sake of arguing let\u2019s talk about power scaling lol\n\nKaguya was beaten by Naruto and Sasuke only because they had seals given to them by Hagoromo himself which they lost after the war. They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

In one of the recent chapters it was revealed that the seal basically slowly turns him into an otsutsuki, But it's kind of like Orochimaru's cursed seal and the Otsustsuki will take control of the body when the seal fully matures. Or at least that's what normally happens, but Boruto can probably counter it using his Jogan and fully control his transformation.!<\n\n>!We also got a taste of this power in one of the recent chapters when Boruto effortlessly destroyed a Kara member using this transformation. All Kara members were supposed to be as strong as an Otsustsuki, this guy was supposed to be stronger than Delta who gave even Naruto a lot of trouble, and finally this guys was sent to fight Sasuke. So he wasn't some weakling.!<",

It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke. But for the sake of arguing let\u2019s talk about power scaling lol\n\nKaguya was beaten by Naruto and Sasuke only because they had seals given to them by Hagoromo himself which they lost after the war. They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke. But for the sake of arguing let\u2019s talk about power scaling lol\n\nKaguya was beaten by Naruto and Sasuke only because they had seals given to them by Hagoromo himself which they lost after the war. They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke. But for the sake of arguing let\u2019s talk about power scaling lol\n\nKaguya was beaten by Naruto and Sasuke only because they had seals given to them by Hagoromo himself which they lost after the war. They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

It\u2019s unlikely that Boruto will surpass Naruto with his Karma seal let alone Naruto + Sasuke.

They literally couldn\u2019t do anything against her if she came back.\n\nI mean I guess I\u2019ll give you Momoshiki since Naruto and Sasuke did beat him, but what I will say is that in the manga that fight was a lot more balanced. The only real thing that happened in the manga was Naruto and Sasuke Kurama Susanoo thing going against Momoshiki\u2019s big rock.\n\nMadara literally has all of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities + like 100 years of battle experience. Especially considering that Naruto lost his TSB, it\u2019s 50/50 if they could beat Madara\n\nHagoromo is just Madara but stronger.\n\nDid you just try to convince me that Naruto alone could beat Jigen. Are you fucking joking. Naruto and Sasuke fucking fought Jigen at *full power* and literally only landed one hit on him. Sasuke had to muster up the last of his chakra to teleport to a fucking hospital and Naruto was literally sealed away in a pot.",

People dislike Kaguya because she took Madara\u2019s spotlight and because she didn\u2019t use any actual strategy in her attacks. It was just Dragon Ball super big avatar stuff.\n\nOtsutsuki like Momoshiki are pretty well liked because they aren\u2019t forced in and because they actually use strategic moves and aren\u2019t some brain dead like Kaguya. \n\nYou\u2019ll notice that if you read the Boruto manga, *every* fight is strategic to the bone and there\u2019s more to it to just some really powerful dudes duking it out",
