IE: Less scraggly hairs and more definition with some gradual fading on the edges to keep your facial hair from looking like something of a hair tattoo. You could also use beard oil or conditioner. It seems to add some sheen. The resulting look would be more sharp and you'd look great in a suit.\n\nJust my 2 cents though.",
