I also always prided myself in not crying for \u201cstupid tv shows\u201d so I actively tried not to get emotional, but I guess minato\u2019s scene released that gate, and the next time I watched naruto, I\u2019m pretty sure I cried during Jiraya\u2019s death.",

I also always prided myself in not crying for \u201cstupid tv shows\u201d so I actively tried not to get emotional, but I guess minato\u2019s scene released that gate, and the next time I watched naruto, I\u2019m pretty sure I cried during Jiraya\u2019s death.",

Each fandom has that one side that always needs to poke fun at another shows of the same genre (shounen in this case) to get a sense of superiority (for some reason).",
