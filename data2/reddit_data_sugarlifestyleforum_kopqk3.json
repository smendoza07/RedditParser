And every day, there are posts from both SDs and SBs who are frustrated that they're inundated in crap while they can't find what they're looking for.\n\nThe frustrated SDs are told, yeah, it's because of TikTok and YouTube, the bowl ain't what it used to be.\n\nThe frustrated SBs are told, well, there are so many SBs for every SD, why don't you try a profile review so you can improve your chances.\n\nSo, is it a buyer's market? Or is that just what we tell ourselves on this sub, while the SDs complain about TikTok and the SBs work to actually improve their chances? Some days, I'm not so sure.",

I think its more of an even playing field than other dating apps because men are bringing more to the table...money. However...if you're a good looking woman you still have multiple offers and POTs. No matter how much money you have....you're still just a man with money till a woman says yes. Now if an SB is sugaring out of desperation...then I really do see the argument there, but only in that case. I believe myself to be slightly above average and I still turn men down in the bowl. I don't feel that power dynamic so many SDs are talking about. Not saying it's not there...Im just not convinced it exists for for every women in the bowl.",

I think it will always be a buyer's market and I'm fairly certain that it always has been. Wherever women need money there's men and sometimes women to exchange with them",

In my case, Im not dependant on that, so if a man approaches me and makes an offer, but I don't like said offer, I refuse and take an offer I like from someone else. \n\nSure its easier for men to find what they're looking for in sugar vs vanilla dating, but I struggle to understand how SDs hold the power when SBs can easily say no and go with another offer. Sure there will proably be someone else who will take his offer...but he has to settle for someone else because just as an SD controls who gets his money, an SB controls who she sleeps with. Or maybe I should say choose...not settle. Idk lol. All I'm trying to say is I don't feel that dynamic people are talking about. I only see it if an SB is desperate for the cash.",

SDS I wouldn't say are completely in control but mostly because if they don't want to give their money out and SBS are looking for money how is an SB going to force someone to give them what they want if SDS don't want to give it out. I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

I\u2019m also from a sales background so putting prospects into a funnel and getting down to who is serious is also common for me.\n\nI typically exchange pleasantries,  compliment them,  give them my background and expectations and then see if they can meet for a quick meet and greet.  This is 2/3 messages,  not being pen pals.  This eliminates 70% off the bat.  They want something different or they are just feeling things out.  \n\nThen you have meet and greets.  Coffee or Happy Hour.  No long dates, no trying to hug or kiss them, no expectations at all.  I give them a gift for their time.  This weeds out another 15% because you don\u2019t click, they are unreliable, not what you expected, etc.  \n\nNow you text a little and get a better feel for them.\n\nThen you go to a first real date.  Allowance, dinner somewhere nice, wine, intimacy, etc.  This weeds out another 15% because sugar dating just isn\u2019t for them,  you are not on the same page physically, they don\u2019t actually like older guys, conversation is strained,  overly shy, etc.  \n\nIf all of those things go well ,  and hopefully they take place within 7-10 days of your first message, you have yourself an arrangement.  Be kind, follow through,  communicate clearly and enjoy the ride . \n\n\nTip for both sides; if you don\u2019t like the matches or communication you are getting then circle back to your ad.   You don\u2019t want to write a novel and get all that professional pictures but put some effort in and be direct.   Be clear be concise about what you are looking for and have high quality,  flattering pictures.",

Any and all dating sites will be easy for you,  SA included.  \n\nYou have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a 40+ year old man on regular dating sites.  No clue at all.  Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.  It doesn\u2019t mean that beautiful young SB\u2019s will struggle to find anyone but they will have to do some vetting to find a real one.",

And every day, there are posts from both SDs and SBs who are frustrated that they're inundated in crap while they can't find what they're looking for.\n\nThe frustrated SDs are told, yeah, it's because of TikTok and YouTube, the bowl ain't what it used to be.\n\nThe frustrated SBs are told, well, there are so many SBs for every SD, why don't you try a profile review so you can improve your chances.\n\nSo, is it a buyer's market? Or is that just what we tell ourselves on this sub, while the SDs complain about TikTok and the SBs work to actually improve their chances? Some days, I'm not so sure.",

Sure there will proably be someone else who will take his offer...but he has to settle for someone else because just as an SD controls who gets his money, an SB controls who she sleeps with. Or maybe I should say choose...not settle. Idk lol. All I'm trying to say is I don't feel that dynamic people are talking about. I only see it if an SB is desperate for the cash.",

I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

I\u2019m also from a sales background so putting prospects into a funnel and getting down to who is serious is also common for me.\n\nI typically exchange pleasantries,  compliment them,  give them my background and expectations and then see if they can meet for a quick meet and greet.  This is 2/3 messages,  not being pen pals.  This eliminates 70% off the bat.  They want something different or they are just feeling things out.  \n\nThen you have meet and greets.  Coffee or Happy Hour.  No long dates, no trying to hug or kiss them, no expectations at all.  I give them a gift for their time.  This weeds out another 15% because you don\u2019t click, they are unreliable, not what you expected, etc.  \n\nNow you text a little and get a better feel for them.\n\nThen you go to a first real date.  Allowance, dinner somewhere nice, wine, intimacy, etc.  This weeds out another 15% because sugar dating just isn\u2019t for them,  you are not on the same page physically, they don\u2019t actually like older guys, conversation is strained,  overly shy, etc.  \n\nIf all of those things go well ,  and hopefully they take place within 7-10 days of your first message, you have yourself an arrangement.  Be kind, follow through,  communicate clearly and enjoy the ride . \n\n\nTip for both sides; if you don\u2019t like the matches or communication you are getting then circle back to your ad.   You don\u2019t want to write a novel and get all that professional pictures but put some effort in and be direct.   Be clear be concise about what you are looking for and have high quality,  flattering pictures.",

Any and all dating sites will be easy for you,  SA included.  \n\nYou have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a 40+ year old man on regular dating sites.  No clue at all.  Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.  It doesn\u2019t mean that beautiful young SB\u2019s will struggle to find anyone but they will have to do some vetting to find a real one.",

It can take forever to find a reasonably attractive girl to take out on a date. \n\nOn SA it\u2019s another world. My first week on SA I think I had 8 M&G\u2019s all with beautiful young women. I had to literally turn down M&G\u2019s with beautiful women that I would be killing for on tinder. Almost every single girl I message will respond on SA and want to pursue something with me. Not saying this to brag, just using it as a comparison between my luck on tinder vs SA. \n\nA lot of POT\u2019s ask me why I\u2019m on SA, because I\u2019m too young and \u201cgood looking\u201d to be on there.

I think its more of an even playing field than other dating apps because men are bringing more to the table...money. However...if you're a good looking woman you still have multiple offers and POTs. No matter how much money you have....you're still just a man with money till a woman says yes. Now if an SB is sugaring out of desperation...then I really do see the argument there, but only in that case. I believe myself to be slightly above average and I still turn men down in the bowl. I don't feel that power dynamic so many SDs are talking about. Not saying it's not there...Im just not convinced it exists for for every women in the bowl.",

In my case, Im not dependant on that, so if a man approaches me and makes an offer, but I don't like said offer, I refuse and take an offer I like from someone else. \n\nSure its easier for men to find what they're looking for in sugar vs vanilla dating, but I struggle to understand how SDs hold the power when SBs can easily say no and go with another offer. Sure there will proably be someone else who will take his offer...but he has to settle for someone else because just as an SD controls who gets his money, an SB controls who she sleeps with. Or maybe I should say choose...not settle. Idk lol. All I'm trying to say is I don't feel that dynamic people are talking about. I only see it if an SB is desperate for the cash.",

SDS I wouldn't say are completely in control but mostly because if they don't want to give their money out and SBS are looking for money how is an SB going to force someone to give them what they want if SDS don't want to give it out. I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say).

I\u2019m also from a sales background so putting prospects into a funnel and getting down to who is serious is also common for me.\n\nI typically exchange pleasantries,  compliment them,  give them my background and expectations and then see if they can meet for a quick meet and greet.  This is 2/3 messages,  not being pen pals.  This eliminates 70% off the bat.  They want something different or they are just feeling things out.  \n\nThen you have meet and greets.  Coffee or Happy Hour.  No long dates, no trying to hug or kiss them, no expectations at all.  I give them a gift for their time.  This weeds out another 15% because you don\u2019t click, they are unreliable, not what you expected, etc.  \n\nNow you text a little and get a better feel for them.\n\nThen you go to a first real date.  Allowance, dinner somewhere nice, wine, intimacy, etc.  This weeds out another 15% because sugar dating just isn\u2019t for them,  you are not on the same page physically, they don\u2019t actually like older guys, conversation is strained,  overly shy, etc.  \n\nIf all of those things go well ,  and hopefully they take place within 7-10 days of your first message, you have yourself an arrangement.  Be kind, follow through,  communicate clearly and enjoy the ride . \n\n\nTip for both sides; if you don\u2019t like the matches or communication you are getting then circle back to your ad.   You don\u2019t want to write a novel and get all that professional pictures but put some effort in and be direct.   Be clear be concise about what you are looking for and have high quality,  flattering pictures.",

Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.

I had to literally turn down M&G\u2019s with beautiful women that I would be killing for on tinder. Almost every single girl I message will respond on SA and want to pursue something with me. Not saying this to brag, just using it as a comparison between my luck on tinder vs SA. \n\nA lot of POT\u2019s ask me why I\u2019m on SA, because I\u2019m too young and \u201cgood looking\u201d to be on there. According to them. I just say well it\u2019s easier to meet women this way lol. I\u2019m tired of having no luck on tinder.",

No matter how much money you have....you're still just a man with money till a woman says yes. Now if an SB is sugaring out of desperation...then I really do see the argument there, but only in that case. I believe myself to be slightly above average and I still turn men down in the bowl.

Sure there will proably be someone else who will take his offer...but he has to settle for someone else because just as an SD controls who gets his money, an SB controls who she sleeps with. Or maybe I should say choose...not settle. Idk lol. All I'm trying to say is I don't feel that dynamic people are talking about. I only see it if an SB is desperate for the cash.",

I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

We all trade stories of hundreds of messages on SA, mostly crap, and the difficulty of separating the genuine humans from the cruft.\n\nSo, is it a buyer's market? You all have lot more experience than I do. But it seems to me it could just as easily be simply a market with plenty of liquidity.\n\nThe typical response to this is: Just look at all the SBs coming here asking for help. They can't find SDs.

They just get told it's SA's fault, or TikTok's or YouTube's, instead of being told they need to improve in order to compete.\n\nAgain, I want to be careful stacking my few weeks of experience against the collective years of experience on this sub.

I\u2019m also from a sales background so putting prospects into a funnel and getting down to who is serious is also common for me.\n\nI typically exchange pleasantries,  compliment them,  give them my background and expectations and then see if they can meet for a quick meet and greet.  This is 2/3 messages,  not being pen pals.  This eliminates 70% off the bat.  They want something different or they are just feeling things out.  \n\nThen you have meet and greets.  Coffee or Happy Hour.  No long dates, no trying to hug or kiss them, no expectations at all.  I give them a gift for their time.  This weeds out another 15% because you don\u2019t click, they are unreliable, not what you expected, etc.  \n\nNow you text a little and get a better feel for them.\n\nThen you go to a first real date.  Allowance, dinner somewhere nice, wine, intimacy, etc.  This weeds out another 15% because sugar dating just isn\u2019t for them,  you are not on the same page physically, they don\u2019t actually like older guys, conversation is strained,  overly shy, etc.  \n\nIf all of those things go well ,  and hopefully they take place within 7-10 days of your first message, you have yourself an arrangement.  Be kind, follow through,  communicate clearly and enjoy the ride . \n\n\nTip for both sides; if you don\u2019t like the matches or communication you are getting then circle back to your ad.   You don\u2019t want to write a novel and get all that professional pictures but put some effort in and be direct.   Be clear be concise about what you are looking for and have high quality,  flattering pictures.",

Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.

On tinder and bumble I could swipe all day and maybe get a few matches here and there. I\u2019m Nothing special on these apps, too much competition. It can take forever to find a reasonably attractive girl to take out on a date. \n\nOn SA it\u2019s another world. My first week on SA I think I had 8 M&G\u2019s all with beautiful young women. I had to literally turn down M&G\u2019s with beautiful women that I would be killing for on tinder. Almost every single girl I message will respond on SA and want to pursue something with me. Not saying this to brag, just using it as a comparison between my luck on tinder vs SA. \n\nA lot of POT\u2019s ask me why I\u2019m on SA, because I\u2019m too young and \u201cgood looking\u201d to be on there. According to them. I just say well it\u2019s easier to meet women this way lol. I\u2019m tired of having no luck on tinder.",

Sure there will proably be someone else who will take his offer...but he has to settle for someone else because just as an SD controls who gets his money, an SB controls who she sleeps with. Or maybe I should say choose...not settle. Idk lol. All I'm trying to say is I don't feel that dynamic people are talking about. I only see it if an SB is desperate for the cash.",

SDS I wouldn't say are completely in control but mostly because if they don't want to give their money out and SBS are looking for money how is an SB going to force someone to give them what they want if SDS don't want to give it out. I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

(The other prefers only one, in addition to her vanilla BF.) They weren't too hard for her to find either. We all trade stories of hundreds of messages on SA, mostly crap, and the difficulty of separating the genuine humans from the cruft.\n\nSo, is it a buyer's market? You all have lot more experience than I do. But it seems to me it could just as easily be simply a market with plenty of liquidity.\n\nThe typical response to this is: Just look at all the SBs coming here asking for help. They can't find SDs. But I see plenty of SDs complaining every day too. They just get told it's SA's fault, or TikTok's or YouTube's, instead of being told they need to improve in order to compete.\n\nAgain, I want to be careful stacking my few weeks of experience against the collective years of experience on this sub. But just for my own personal opinion, I'm as yet far from convinced.",

I\u2019m also from a sales background so putting prospects into a funnel and getting down to who is serious is also common for me.\n\nI typically exchange pleasantries,  compliment them,  give them my background and expectations and then see if they can meet for a quick meet and greet.  This is 2/3 messages,  not being pen pals.  This eliminates 70% off the bat.  They want something different or they are just feeling things out.  \n\nThen you have meet and greets.  Coffee or Happy Hour.  No long dates, no trying to hug or kiss them, no expectations at all.  I give them a gift for their time.  This weeds out another 15% because you don\u2019t click, they are unreliable, not what you expected, etc.  \n\nNow you text a little and get a better feel for them.\n\nThen you go to a first real date.  Allowance, dinner somewhere nice, wine, intimacy, etc.  This weeds out another 15% because sugar dating just isn\u2019t for them,  you are not on the same page physically, they don\u2019t actually like older guys, conversation is strained,  overly shy, etc.  \n\nIf all of those things go well ,  and hopefully they take place within 7-10 days of your first message, you have yourself an arrangement.  Be kind, follow through,  communicate clearly and enjoy the ride . \n\n\nTip for both sides; if you don\u2019t like the matches or communication you are getting then circle back to your ad.   You don\u2019t want to write a novel and get all that professional pictures but put some effort in and be direct.   Be clear be concise about what you are looking for and have high quality,  flattering pictures.",

Any and all dating sites will be easy for you,  SA included.  \n\nYou have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a 40+ year old man on regular dating sites.  No clue at all.  Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.  It doesn\u2019t mean that beautiful young SB\u2019s will struggle to find anyone but they will have to do some vetting to find a real one.",

In my case, Im not dependant on that, so if a man approaches me and makes an offer, but I don't like said offer, I refuse and take an offer I like from someone else. \n\nSure its easier for men to find what they're looking for in sugar vs vanilla dating, but I struggle to understand how SDs hold the power when SBs can easily say no and go with another offer. Sure there will proably be someone else who will take his offer...but he has to settle for someone else because just as an SD controls who gets his money, an SB controls who she sleeps with. Or maybe I should say choose...not settle. Idk lol. All I'm trying to say is I don't feel that dynamic people are talking about. I only see it if an SB is desperate for the cash.",

SDS I wouldn't say are completely in control but mostly because if they don't want to give their money out and SBS are looking for money how is an SB going to force someone to give them what they want if SDS don't want to give it out. I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

I\u2019m also from a sales background so putting prospects into a funnel and getting down to who is serious is also common for me.\n\nI typically exchange pleasantries,  compliment them,  give them my background and expectations and then see if they can meet for a quick meet and greet.  This is 2/3 messages,  not being pen pals.  This eliminates 70% off the bat.  They want something different or they are just feeling things out.  \n\nThen you have meet and greets.  Coffee or Happy Hour.  No long dates, no trying to hug or kiss them, no expectations at all.  I give them a gift for their time.  This weeds out another 15% because you don\u2019t click, they are unreliable, not what you expected, etc.  \n\nNow you text a little and get a better feel for them.\n\nThen you go to a first real date.  Allowance, dinner somewhere nice, wine, intimacy, etc.  This weeds out another 15% because sugar dating just isn\u2019t for them,  you are not on the same page physically, they don\u2019t actually like older guys, conversation is strained,  overly shy, etc.  \n\nIf all of those things go well ,  and hopefully they take place within 7-10 days of your first message, you have yourself an arrangement.  Be kind, follow through,  communicate clearly and enjoy the ride . \n\n\nTip for both sides; if you don\u2019t like the matches or communication you are getting then circle back to your ad.   You don\u2019t want to write a novel and get all that professional pictures but put some effort in and be direct.   Be clear be concise about what you are looking for and have high quality,  flattering pictures.",

Any and all dating sites will be easy for you,  SA included.  \n\nYou have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a 40+ year old man on regular dating sites.  No clue at all.  Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.  It doesn\u2019t mean that beautiful young SB\u2019s will struggle to find anyone but they will have to do some vetting to find a real one.",

It can take forever to find a reasonably attractive girl to take out on a date. \n\nOn SA it\u2019s another world. My first week on SA I think I had 8 M&G\u2019s all with beautiful young women. I had to literally turn down M&G\u2019s with beautiful women that I would be killing for on tinder. Almost every single girl I message will respond on SA and want to pursue something with me.

SDS I wouldn't say are completely in control but mostly because if they don't want to give their money out and SBS are looking for money how is an SB going to force someone to give them what they want if SDS don't want to give it out. I would say the same thing with rates because if sb1 wants x amount sb2 wants xx and sb3 wants XXX but SD is only going to give y then it is up to the SBS of who wants to make a compromise or SD will find the SB who will take said y. kind of a weird way of explaining it but that's the best business analogy I can come up with as it's the same thing with buying stocks properties or anything else you want to invest your time and money in even though it's the same concept I do know that people are different than stocks I just don't want to get that misconstrued",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

Any and all dating sites will be easy for you,  SA included.  \n\nYou have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a 40+ year old man on regular dating sites.  No clue at all.  Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.  It doesn\u2019t mean that beautiful young SB\u2019s will struggle to find anyone but they will have to do some vetting to find a real one.",

Some SDs don't care so its easier to not be as picky, but there are also SDs who know what they want. Its quite specific and sometimes they must compromise to get the SB they want.\n\nI suppose it boils down to the specific SD and SB. Maybe overall the feel of the bowl is that way due to women really needing the cash or just wanting sex themselves, but the moment you don't need the cash, the power shifts again. \n\nThey way that a lot of men furiously chase sex amazes me. They pay for it because its apparently that precious, so at the end of the day, the woman has what the SD wants. There has to be a consenting woman to give that to them.....there are multiple ways for women to get money...but only one way for men to get sex (well..one way to get the type of sex they want I should say). I am not trying to be disrespectful or degrading in anyway, Im really just typing out how my brain is thinking through this.\n\nEdit- Had to repost from my SB account instead of my normal browsing account because attention to detail...lol",

Any and all dating sites will be easy for you,  SA included.  \n\nYou have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a 40+ year old man on regular dating sites.  No clue at all.  Just his face on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge,etc with a short bio.  Of course it\u2019s tacky to brag about money and status so that\u2019s out the window.  The online dating experience for 95% of men is so miserable that Brandon Wade created his own website.  Think about how much time, money and effort that took in 2006.  \n\nCompared to regular OLD Seeking Is Nirvana.  It is absolutely a buyers market and 3000% easier for to date hot younger women than ANY other Avenue.  You immediately cut down to the relatively small  percentage young ladies that are actively looking for such an arrangement.  Of course beautiful young ladies will have a bunch of contacts and M&G\u2019s and will find a legit SD.  It might be on their first meeting or they may have to sift through some fakers but it can be done.   Men have to do the same.    It is a buyers market for men relative to regular dating because it is so much easier and damn near any guy that is a real, legit, genuine SD can find an attractive young SB.  \n\nI am not claiming to be the biggest prize ever but for a SD I am in the top 20%.   Let\u2019s say in real life I am a 6 or 6.5 for my age, 42.  In the bowl I have girls aggressively chasing me in a way that 42 year old men don\u2019t get chased by young hotties.  As I said in my original response,  I could have 20 if my time and money allowed.  That really feels like a buyers market to men.  It doesn\u2019t mean that beautiful young SB\u2019s will struggle to find anyone but they will have to do some vetting to find a real one.",

I had to literally turn down M&G\u2019s with beautiful women that I would be killing for on tinder. Almost every single girl I message will respond on SA and want to pursue something with me. Not saying this to brag, just using it as a comparison between my luck on tinder vs SA. \n\nA lot of POT\u2019s ask me why I\u2019m on SA, because I\u2019m too young and \u201cgood looking\u201d to be on there.
