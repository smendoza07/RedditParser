    "body": "Hi, new RM fanatic right here. Just wanna share this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy daughter got me into Running Man.\n\nEvery night after dinner I always see her giggling at her laptop. Like... piss herself giggling.\n\nI was intrigued... I thought, FB isn't supposed to be this funny?! Much less online classes and research!!\n\nSo I had to ask her what she's watching. She was hesitant to show it, (I was never a fan of KPOP, which she is CRAAAZY about, and all other Korean things). So I said, c'mon, I wont laugh or make a joke, promise :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo she showed me what she was watching, it was the latest episode at the time. I watched for a couple seconds and she said \"You missed the funny bit.\" she openned Youtube and typed in \"Running Man a capella\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOH MY GOOODD!!! I HAD NEVER LAUGHED SO LOUD MY WHOLE LIFE!!! and then the horror house (labyrinth??)... the challenges, the punishments, the betrayals... THEY JUST KEEP ON COMIN AND I CANT KEEP UP!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuffice to say. I did not sleep that night.\n\nI binge watched RM till sunrise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver breakfast, I was so proud and told her... \"Know who my fave RM member is? ...Swang Kook.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I hadnt had my coffee yet...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe quickly finished our food and head on to the computer to watch her \"Must-watch-for-newbies\" list for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I was crying. All tears of joy. Partly because of the fun, but mostly for the bonding experience that it brought for me and my daughter...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks RUNNING MAN!!!",

The first episode I saw was episode 95 which had Sistar as guests and then Park Ji Sung.  Episode 96 was the Superpower soccer match and I have never laughed so hard.  I was hooked.

It's like a weekly ritual for us so now we compensate by using Discord while watching it. I can't even count how many times I almost choked on my food or spurted my drink out due to the cast members' antics over the years but I'm not complaining.",

Like... piss herself giggling.\n\nI was intrigued... I thought, FB isn't supposed to be this funny?! Much less online classes and research!!\n\nSo I had to ask her what she's watching. She was hesitant to show it, (I was never a fan of KPOP, which she is CRAAAZY about, and all other Korean things). So I said, c'mon, I wont laugh or make a joke, promise :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo she showed me what she was watching, it was the latest episode at the time. I watched for a couple seconds and she said \"You missed the funny bit.\" she openned Youtube and typed in \"Running Man a capella\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOH MY GOOODD!!! I HAD NEVER LAUGHED SO LOUD MY WHOLE LIFE!!! and then the horror house (labyrinth??)... the challenges, the punishments, the betrayals... THEY JUST KEEP ON COMIN AND I CANT KEEP UP!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuffice to say. I did not sleep that night.\n\nI binge watched RM till sunrise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver breakfast, I was so proud and told her... \"Know who my fave RM member is? ...Swang Kook.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I hadnt had my coffee yet...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe quickly finished our food and head on to the computer to watch her \"Must-watch-for-newbies\" list for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I was crying. All tears of joy. Partly because of the fun the show brought to us, but mostly for the bonding experience that it brought for me and my daughter...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks RUNNING MAN!!!",

We got into  an agreement where my daughter is with her M-F, and with me during the  weekends.\n\nShe had always been  closer with me than with her Mom. But along the years where she spent  most days with her mother, I was worried that would change.\n\nNow...  Whenever she's with her mother, I cant help but mssg her about the  latest inside jokes and memes abt Running Man.And when the weekend hits!  Lol prepare all the popcorns!!!\n\n(Also  I saw Jennie in that horror house with Kwang Soo and I thought she was  cute.., my daughter told me that was Jennie from Blackpink. now I think I  love blackpink... pls [help.lol](https://help.lol/).)\n\nAnyway.. Uhhh.. pls. Reccommend episodes... Tnx!\"",

I've loved them since I was a kid because the cast members form this camaderie that I rarely see on American TV. \n\nThis is a total tangent but for people who want to study Korean, I highly recommend watching the variety shows over scripted dramas. I was born and raised in the U.S but I have good listening comprehension partially from watching K-variety shows since the early 00s because they showcase how native Koreans actually speak. Plus my parents never taught me slang or kept up with new slang (they immigrated to the U.S. from Korea). Just my two cents!",

But along the years where she spent  most days with her mother, I was worried that would change.\n\nNow...  Whenever she's with her mother, I cant help but mssg her about the  latest inside jokes and memes abt Running Man.And when the weekend hits!  Lol prepare all the popcorns!!!\n\n(Also  I saw Jennie in that horror house with Kwang Soo and I thought she was  cute.., my daughter told me that was Jennie from Blackpink. now I think I  love blackpink... pls [help.lol](https://help.lol/).)\n\nAnyway.. Uhhh.. pls. Reccommend episodes... Tnx!\"",
