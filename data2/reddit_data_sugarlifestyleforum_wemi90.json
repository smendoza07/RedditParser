    "body": "I have been in two successful long term arrangements, and it took a bit of looking each time to find the right person. I hope these guidelines can help other women weed out who is serious, who is not, and who is going to be a massive headache to deal with. With the right person, the M&G process should be easy and exciting :) \n\nThis post is not meant to be about complaining, it\u2019s just to help others like me find their best match.\n\n\n**Green Flags**\n\nHe opens with a detailed message about himself and what he is looking for. Bonus points if he includes something specific he liked about your profile. \n\nHe suggests a time (or multiple times to choose from) to meet. He suggests a nice place, or shows enthusiasm about the place you choose. \n\nHe sends photos without you having to ask, or explains why he isn\u2019t comfortable sending photos yet and provides some form of verification.\n\nHe is clear that he understands what a sugar relationship is, and communicates exactly what he wants without being overtly sexual. \n\nDuring the M&G, he asks questions about you, and listens to what you have to say. He is open to talking about the terms of the arrangement. You are able to come to an agreement about what works for you both. You feel comfortable telling him your needs. You have the sense that he wants to make you happy. \n\nHe makes it clear that he is happy to see you and is enjoying your company. By the end, you feel that you are both on the same page, and are ideally looking forward to a second date. \n\n**Yellow Flags** \n\nHe opens with a generic message like \u201cHow are you?\u201d. If his profile is detailed it\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nHe wants to meet but insists you choose the time/place and doesn\u2019t give much input. \n\nHe sends photos only after being asked (despite requesting more pictures from you.) \n\nHe asks, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d and then answers, \u201cI could do that.\u201d He is not clear about what he wants or expects. Maybe he could do that, maybe not. Some men will say anything. \n\nThe M&G is awkward. The conversation doesn\u2019t flow well. You feel like you are carrying the conversation. \n\nYou leave the date unsure about how you feel. It could just be the awkwardness of meeting a new person, or it could be a bad fit. It\u2019s up to you to decide if you want to move forward.\n\n**Red Flags (Instant Next)**\n\nHe opens with a generic compliment or some other odd statement that is difficult to reply to. (\u201cWow!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so sexy!\u201d) He opens with an overtly sexual message about his fetishes or desires, or he brings them up before talking about anything else. He opens by saying he is only in your city for one night (a few days, one week) and wants to meet up. \n\nHe wants to meet immediately. He insists on picking you up (personally, I think even offering is weird.) He insists you meet at his house. Or he insists you choose the location for the date, but then rejects your choice without offering another option.\n\nHe keeps asking you for more photos (even if he has sent some.) He asks you for \u201csexy\u201d or nude photos before you have met. His photos are clearly decades old. He refuses to send any photos at all or do a video call. You aren\u2019t the least bit attracted to him. \n\nHe asks what you are looking for, then tries to talk you down. The wealthier he claims to be, the more concerning this is. A gentleman will simply tell you he is not able to meet your needs and try to compromise or let you go. He tells you he doesn\u2019t want to talk about money. He tells you he doesn\u2019t want something \u201ctransactional\u201d. He tells you that you can ask him for \u201chelp\u201d sometimes if you \u201cneed\u201d it, but that\u2019s it. He makes vague promises but refuses to be specific about his capabilities. \n\nHe tries to engage with you sexually before agreeing on the terms of the arrangement, and gets offended when you reject his advances. Or he makes advances and you feel like you can\u2019t say \u201cNo\u201d, even though you want to. At any point, you feel uncomfortable bringing up the terms of the arrangement with him, telling him how you feel, or asking for what you need. \n\nThe M&G is chaotic. Maybe there were some exciting parts, but there were also things you did not like. He interrupts you. He insists on ordering for you. He spends the whole time talking about himself. He gives you back-handed compliments. He criticizes you in any way. He has bad hygiene, or doesn\u2019t dress well. He shows up excessively late (15+mins). He doesn\u2019t look like his pictures, or used certain pictures to hide that he was overweight. He insists you get in his car. He feels entitled to sex after the date. You didn\u2019t discuss the terms of the arrangement at all. Or, you agree on terms, and he demands you delete your account and stop seeing anyone else. \n\nHe brings up marriage, commitment, children, or making other major life decisions with you like they are no big deal. You don\u2019t have any reason to trust that he is who he says he is (claims to be a millionaire businessman but has no social skills, his story lacks any real details, etc). He asks you highly personal questions. He tells you too much personal information about himself. Going into detail about his divorce, his marital problems, or his complaints about his past girlfriend/sugar baby is a sign for you to RUN!!!! You leave the date feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, irritated, or sad.",
