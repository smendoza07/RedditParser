People might think that contradicts his desire to be *hokage,* but I think it shows the reason for his dream; to be someone who is connected with the people around him on an emotional level, not superficial. \n\nAlso, it's a nice balance to his orange attire (which I genuinely love). The orange is bright, but having a simple haircut mellows out his character a bit more. I could go on and on about how this was actually a genius move in developing him as the hero of the story, but this should be sufficient.",
