My words are solely of mine only. To me, I wanted to see more of obito aswell as Shisui. I wanted to see just how much neji evolved.

It's 80% of Sasuke's character development, Shisui's death also needed to happen for the whole uchiha plot to move on and Obito really would just be in prison so what's the point of keeping him alive. So point is Uchiha need to die",

Kishimoto wanted to create a dark ambience and that's great but as I said before he didn't quite use certain characters to thier fullest. \n\nTo be fair, I'm just another fan and I can't in no circumstances argue with the approach of the shows creator himself. My words are solely of mine only. To me, I wanted to see more of obito aswell as Shisui. I wanted to see just how much neji evolved. I wanted to see the impact of the Uchiha clan more \n\nI honestly don't even want to talk about Boruto. Everything seems so flaccid. If I were given a few more years of naruto I would gladly take it anytime.",
