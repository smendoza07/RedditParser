    "body": "Reading this subsection mainly for entertainment, and quite frankly it shocked me how many times a girl is describing a scenario that has 34 red flags written all over it, yet still asks whether she should see him again because XYZ. It's partially meant as a funny list, but hopefully it will help you avoid falling for the wrong SD. If you encounter any of these, avoid them like the plague.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAvoid the Sugar Daddy who ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Wants to have unprotected sex early on. If he does it with you, he is doing it with many others.\n2. Makes less than $125K a year. Do the math, he cannot afford you. If you conclude otherwise, raise your price.\n3. Talks about his former SBs all the time. If he liked them so much, he should have paid them more.\n4. Talks condescending about or brags about cheating on his wife.\n5. Wants to have any sort of intimacy before paying you. Although really, if you fall for 'I want a test ride first', you had it coming.\n6. Refers to you as 'princess', 'queen', or 'goddess'.\n7. Is 30 years old, handsome and charming. He's paying you for a reason. The few 'sugar daddies' I know that fall into this category are seriously messed up mentally.\n8. Is judgmental about your lifestyle or you having a boyfriend. The hypocrisy is almost ironic.\n9. Expects you to text him 20 times a day. You agreed to get paid per meet, not per text.\n10. Just doesn't feel right. Trust your instinct. It's usually correct.",

Let's be real, the prettier, younger girls, who live on the coasts get the top end and if they happen to be 28+, average looks, and living in rural Kansas, they get much less. The point is, there aren't enough SD's to meet the demand of how many SB's exist today so not everyone gets what is considered \"normal\" in this sub. Some girls just need rent paid every month and don't care for Michelin stars or Gucci bags. If you eliminate the $125k guys, you would no longer have SB sites and the SB lifestyle would be a story of the past. ",

I'd know her for several years. She was getting $10k a month plus gifts. If she met you she might say you're selling yourself short...I'd tell her that she's just used to living in the clouds. It's the same as you telling a girl who is looking for $3k/mo that she's underselling herself. There is no static pool of men large enough who are offering $6k to make your stance realistic. So if I were giving advice to SB's I'd tell them to look at averages for their area and then determine if they are willing to be average, below average, or above average...then aim for it. In the end, that number may not be anywhere near your $6k and that may be perfectly fine because they're a 30 year old single mom from Kansas who needs to work on herself. Nothing wrong with that. No one is out there paying the Maserati price tag for their shiny new Volvo. There is someone at all levels..on both SB and SD side. Giving bad advice is just giving bad advice. ",

The amount of people that clear 25k a month and are making over 500k per year in this area is small. The amount of those people that actually want to be a sugar daddy is even smaller. So sure, you can wait for one of those whales to come along, but in this city good luck. \n\nThere are plenty of guys, like myself, who make 100-200k in my area that can afford 1-2k per month arrangements. With something like 7 or 8 colleges/unis in the city alone, and tons more within a 1-2 hour drive, a sugar baby can either take the 1-2k allowance, or frankly, not have one. ",

Baby, beautiful, princess and goddess are used. My current SB adores her pet names. So I think this is specific to the relationship. Initially I do not get called pet names, or use pet names.\n\nCondoms number one. Using condoms is the most safe thing to do. Some couples will want to use them, some will choose to not. This post will probably get buried because of this paragraph. Manipulating someone into not using condoms, yah that is a huge red flag. Also, many SBs are sexually actively outside an SR. You only mention SDs.\n\nNumber two. It is about disposable and available income not how much he makes. It is about how much after his bills is available, not how much he takes home. Many people that make 400k a year are up to there necks in debt and may have a wife who is in the middle of the finances. A single guy pulling in 175k in the mid west, with little debt, easily could be a SD. I think someone ran the numbers and they could pull it off in NYC. It is about budget and available/disposable cash not how much you make.\n\nGood advice overall!\n\n",

In my experience & that of many women I've talked to and read of in SR, if a man doesn't want to use protection he usually isn't offering a panel of his recent test results. \n\nMaybe he wants to be exclusive, but until your relationship has stood the test of time & seen each other's STD results, I'd say steer clear of unprotected sex. He may only want it with you, maybe...but it isn't worth the risk when you hardly know each other. ",

I'd know her for several years. She was getting $10k a month plus gifts. If she met you she might say you're selling yourself short...I'd tell her that she's just used to living in the clouds. It's the same as you telling a girl who is looking for $3k/mo that she's underselling herself. There is no static pool of men large enough who are offering $6k to make your stance realistic. So if I were giving advice to SB's I'd tell them to look at averages for their area and then determine if they are willing to be average, below average, or above average...then aim for it. In the end, that number may not be anywhere near your $6k and that may be perfectly fine because they're a 30 year old single mom from Kansas who needs to work on herself. Nothing wrong with that. No one is out there paying the Maserati price tag for their shiny new Volvo. There is someone at all levels..on both SB and SD side. Giving bad advice is just giving bad advice. ",

The amount of people that clear 25k a month and are making over 500k per year in this area is small. The amount of those people that actually want to be a sugar daddy is even smaller. So sure, you can wait for one of those whales to come along, but in this city good luck. \n\nThere are plenty of guys, like myself, who make 100-200k in my area that can afford 1-2k per month arrangements. With something like 7 or 8 colleges/unis in the city alone, and tons more within a 1-2 hour drive, a sugar baby can either take the 1-2k allowance, or frankly, not have one. ",

In my experience & that of many women I've talked to and read of in SR, if a man doesn't want to use protection he usually isn't offering a panel of his recent test results. \n\nMaybe he wants to be exclusive, but until your relationship has stood the test of time & seen each other's STD results, I'd say steer clear of unprotected sex. He may only want it with you, maybe...but it isn't worth the risk when you hardly know each other. ",

It's the same as you telling a girl who is looking for $3k/mo that she's underselling herself. There is no static pool of men large enough who are offering $6k to make your stance realistic. So if I were giving advice to SB's I'd tell them to look at averages for their area and then determine if they are willing to be average, below average, or above average...then aim for it. In the end, that number may not be anywhere near your $6k and that may be perfectly fine because they're a 30 year old single mom from Kansas who needs to work on herself. Nothing wrong with that. No one is out there paying the Maserati price tag for their shiny new Volvo. There is someone at all levels..on both SB and SD side. Giving bad advice is just giving bad advice. ",

The amount of people that clear 25k a month and are making over 500k per year in this area is small. The amount of those people that actually want to be a sugar daddy is even smaller. So sure, you can wait for one of those whales to come along, but in this city good luck. \n\nThere are plenty of guys, like myself, who make 100-200k in my area that can afford 1-2k per month arrangements.

He may only want it with you, maybe...but it isn't worth the risk when you hardly know each other. ",

I'd know her for several years. She was getting $10k a month plus gifts. If she met you she might say you're selling yourself short...I'd tell her that she's just used to living in the clouds. It's the same as you telling a girl who is looking for $3k/mo that she's underselling herself. There is no static pool of men large enough who are offering $6k to make your stance realistic. So if I were giving advice to SB's I'd tell them to look at averages for their area and then determine if they are willing to be average, below average, or above average...then aim for it. In the end, that number may not be anywhere near your $6k and that may be perfectly fine because they're a 30 year old single mom from Kansas who needs to work on herself. Nothing wrong with that. No one is out there paying the Maserati price tag for their shiny new Volvo. There is someone at all levels..on both SB and SD side. Giving bad advice is just giving bad advice. ",

The amount of people that clear 25k a month and are making over 500k per year in this area is small. The amount of those people that actually want to be a sugar daddy is even smaller. So sure, you can wait for one of those whales to come along, but in this city good luck. \n\nThere are plenty of guys, like myself, who make 100-200k in my area that can afford 1-2k per month arrangements. With something like 7 or 8 colleges/unis in the city alone, and tons more within a 1-2 hour drive, a sugar baby can either take the 1-2k allowance, or frankly, not have one. ",

I'd know her for several years. She was getting $10k a month plus gifts. If she met you she might say you're selling yourself short...I'd tell her that she's just used to living in the clouds. It's the same as you telling a girl who is looking for $3k/mo that she's underselling herself. There is no static pool of men large enough who are offering $6k to make your stance realistic. So if I were giving advice to SB's I'd tell them to look at averages for their area and then determine if they are willing to be average, below average, or above average...then aim for it. In the end, that number may not be anywhere near your $6k and that may be perfectly fine because they're a 30 year old single mom from Kansas who needs to work on herself. Nothing wrong with that. No one is out there paying the Maserati price tag for their shiny new Volvo. There is someone at all levels..on both SB and SD side. Giving bad advice is just giving bad advice. ",

The amount of people that clear 25k a month and are making over 500k per year in this area is small. The amount of those people that actually want to be a sugar daddy is even smaller. So sure, you can wait for one of those whales to come along, but in this city good luck. \n\nThere are plenty of guys, like myself, who make 100-200k in my area that can afford 1-2k per month arrangements. With something like 7 or 8 colleges/unis in the city alone, and tons more within a 1-2 hour drive, a sugar baby can either take the 1-2k allowance, or frankly, not have one. ",

I'd know her for several years. She was getting $10k a month plus gifts. If she met you she might say you're selling yourself short...I'd tell her that she's just used to living in the clouds. It's the same as you telling a girl who is looking for $3k/mo that she's underselling herself. There is no static pool of men large enough who are offering $6k to make your stance realistic. So if I were giving advice to SB's I'd tell them to look at averages for their area and then determine if they are willing to be average, below average, or above average...then aim for it. In the end, that number may not be anywhere near your $6k and that may be perfectly fine because they're a 30 year old single mom from Kansas who needs to work on herself. Nothing wrong with that. No one is out there paying the Maserati price tag for their shiny new Volvo. There is someone at all levels..on both SB and SD side. Giving bad advice is just giving bad advice. ",

The amount of people that clear 25k a month and are making over 500k per year in this area is small. The amount of those people that actually want to be a sugar daddy is even smaller. So sure, you can wait for one of those whales to come along, but in this city good luck. \n\nThere are plenty of guys, like myself, who make 100-200k in my area that can afford 1-2k per month arrangements. With something like 7 or 8 colleges/unis in the city alone, and tons more within a 1-2 hour drive, a sugar baby can either take the 1-2k allowance, or frankly, not have one. ",
