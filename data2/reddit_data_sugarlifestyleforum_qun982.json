    "body": "Trying again without short links:\n\nThere was [a post from an SD recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/qoja68/why_is_allowance_always_prepaid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) about why SDs should just offer allowances at the end of the month, because you know, that's how jobs pay their employees. A lively debate ensued. Many pointed out that doing this places a \\*lot\\* of risk on the SB of seeing a man for a month, having sex with them, literally giving him her body, and then potentially never getting whatever financial component was agreed to at the onset of the SR/arrangement.\n\n[This post is a reflection of exactly why SBs should never accept that](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/pzix9g/im_a_salt_daddy_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). This post shows that there truly are absolute shitbird \"SD\"s out there who maliciously set out take advantage of SBs with no intention of ever supporting them. The OP in that post explicitly says that he makes arrangements with women saying he will provide allowance at the end of the month, has sex with them, [then ghosts at the end of the month](https://imgur.com/gRQDoRV) without providing said allowance. He doesn't even do dinners. (Screenshots in that last link, for when the douche canoe OP inevitably deletes his post.)\n\nThis, my dear SDs, is why you should be providing an allowance upfront, at the beginning of the month, if you are on an allowance with your SB. This is also why you should provide PPM upfront, at the beginning of the date, if you are on a PPM basis. It feels just as shitty for a woman to have this happen to her a single time as it does to have it happen for a month. Don't put this kind of risk on your SB. Yes, that poster is a special kind of douche canoe, but there are many like him in the bowl posing as SDs to take advantage of SBs. I would guess a large portion of the women here have come across these men. **Please, be a decent human being**, and consider how this feels for us. I promise, it's a lot worse than you losing a few Benjamins here and there.\n\nSBs: Please, please don't accept post-paid allowance offers from POTs or SDs.\n\nEdit: Because y\u2019all are focusing on simply sticking with PPM and not doing any allowance\u2014as I said, **if** you are on allowance, please make it a beginning of the month (or week) allowance. If you are on PPM, please provide it at the start of the date. I have nothing against anyone wanting to do PPMs, and I agree that it can help protect all parties involved *until trust is built.*\n\n**PPM vs allowance is NOT the point of this post.**",

Only in that case the physical altercation is almost guaranteed since the PPM is physically in your possession. \n\nWhereas a bad actor SB is generally going to be completely deterred if they don't get the money up front as we're a sexually dimorphic species. Unless she's escalating to armed robbery or they're outliers. \n\nLike we're dealing with a piece of shit dude here. He's trying to scam you. Why would he draw the line at scamming? Clearly he's already comfortable with a serious conflict at the meet as he's going to tell you he can't pay you after you've already had the meet and expects you won't just be cool with it. So why not soft extortion? Stand in front of the door and say he actually really needs that money for his mom's medication they only take cash at her pharmacy. But he'll send the money to you on (insert app). What are you gonna do? Physically assault him? Call him the cops? If you're willing to escalate like that then what's stopping you from escalating if he refuses PPM after just the same?",

Your quoted article is from a self-identified salt daddy who never pays allowance at all. There was no PPM until *mutual* trust is established. That's just being naive. That should always be the formula. Then, allowance can happen if everyone is interested. The primary reason it should be at the beginning is stability is the SB's primary benefit. And end of month allowance is inherently less stable than beginning of the month. But there is nothing evil about end of month allowance if the numbers work out to make it a better deal for the SB.",

Only in that case the physical altercation is almost guaranteed since the PPM is physically in your possession. \n\nWhereas a bad actor SB is generally going to be completely deterred if they don't get the money up front as we're a sexually dimorphic species. Unless she's escalating to armed robbery or they're outliers. \n\nLike we're dealing with a piece of shit dude here. He's trying to scam you. Why would he draw the line at scamming? Clearly he's already comfortable with a serious conflict at the meet as he's going to tell you he can't pay you after you've already had the meet and expects you won't just be cool with it. So why not soft extortion? Stand in front of the door and say he actually really needs that money for his mom's medication they only take cash at her pharmacy. But he'll send the money to you on (insert app). What are you gonna do? Physically assault him? Call him the cops? If you're willing to escalate like that then what's stopping you from escalating if he refuses PPM after just the same?",

There was one time where he wasn\u2019t going home, but rather going on a business trip, and I didn\u2019t get the money by the next morning. I mentioned it to him and gave him the benefit of the doubt and said it might\u2019ve been the storm having spotty internet connection. He tried to do it while driving and it didn\u2019t go through, and not even two minutes later I got the Venmo notification. \n\nDo whatever works for you, but honestly cash is annoying to a lot of people. It turns me off just a bit if I know the guy is only going to be using cash rather than money I can actually just transfer into my account.",

Only in that case the physical altercation is almost guaranteed since the PPM is physically in your possession. \n\nWhereas a bad actor SB is generally going to be completely deterred if they don't get the money up front as we're a sexually dimorphic species. Unless she's escalating to armed robbery or they're outliers. \n\nLike we're dealing with a piece of shit dude here. He's trying to scam you. Why would he draw the line at scamming? Clearly he's already comfortable with a serious conflict at the meet as he's going to tell you he can't pay you after you've already had the meet and expects you won't just be cool with it. So why not soft extortion? Stand in front of the door and say he actually really needs that money for his mom's medication they only take cash at her pharmacy. But he'll send the money to you on (insert app). What are you gonna do? Physically assault him? Call him the cops? If you're willing to escalate like that then what's stopping you from escalating if he refuses PPM after just the same?",
