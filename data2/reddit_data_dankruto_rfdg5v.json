Plus all your points only say that Boruto outsmarts his opponents, Naruto is able to outpower his opponents, you say kabuto being surprised like it's bad thing, when it's not? What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

Gaara was just bloodlusted and was focused on lee and stopped when guy stepped in.  Guy also just slapped away sand that was going to crush an already captured lee. He didn't actually stop  a high speed attack or anything. Also its shown that gaaras biggest weakness is his lack of speed. We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically. But naruto has obviously WAY more stamina and durability and is better at using shadow clones/rasengan.",

I don't think Sasuke was bullshitting when he said she was more skilled than he was at 12. He knows his skill set better than anyone. \n\nThis will probably get me massively downvoted, but I think both Boruto and Sarada have shown to be more skilled than their father's at that age. I'm not saying stronger, but in raw skill? Yeah. The next generation has the edge in that regard because they have more resources.",

What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

Both he and Naruto were totally out and Gaara just gave up after because Naruto made him have a change of heart. Naruto DID win that fight, but he didn\u2019t really beat him with like power or anything. They both just ran out of chakra. \n\nIn raw power, Naruto would still likely beat Boruto, but Boruto\u2019s also incredibly clever and way more skilled, he could potentially outplay Naruto and win even in a serious fight. Kinda like how Naruto and Gamabunta outplayed Shukaku despite being way weaker than him.",

He didn't actually stop  a high speed attack or anything. Also its shown that gaaras biggest weakness is his lack of speed. We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically.

He knows his skill set better than anyone. \n\nThis will probably get me massively downvoted, but I think both Boruto and Sarada have shown to be more skilled than their father's at that age.

Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

Both he and Naruto were totally out and Gaara just gave up after because Naruto made him have a change of heart. Naruto DID win that fight, but he didn\u2019t really beat him with like power or anything. They both just ran out of chakra. \n\nIn raw power, Naruto would still likely beat Boruto, but Boruto\u2019s also incredibly clever and way more skilled, he could potentially outplay Naruto and win even in a serious fight.

We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically.

He knows his skill set better than anyone. \n\nThis will probably get me massively downvoted, but I think both Boruto and Sarada have shown to be more skilled than their father's at that age.

No, ask most people they'll answer their favorite subject in the human history is a war (probably the second WW), and pretty much every movies or series or whatever has violence and bad people in it with trauma and stuff. Recent example is squidgame, a world success, it's literally a traumatizing game where people are fighting for their lives and there are hundreds of deaths. \n\nSo yes, it's a GOOD thing in a fiction to have that kind of thing.

What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

S rank missions are give to jonins only normally and they\u2019re not easy even a for team of them.\n\nNaruto is able to beat him at an even stronger level than that. Boruto doesn\u2019t beat that",

Both he and Naruto were totally out and Gaara just gave up after because Naruto made him have a change of heart. Naruto DID win that fight, but he didn\u2019t really beat him with like power or anything. They both just ran out of chakra. \n\nIn raw power, Naruto would still likely beat Boruto, but Boruto\u2019s also incredibly clever and way more skilled, he could potentially outplay Naruto and win even in a serious fight. Kinda like how Naruto and Gamabunta outplayed Shukaku despite being way weaker than him.",

Gaara was just bloodlusted and was focused on lee and stopped when guy stepped in.  Guy also just slapped away sand that was going to crush an already captured lee. He didn't actually stop  a high speed attack or anything. Also its shown that gaaras biggest weakness is his lack of speed. We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically. But naruto has obviously WAY more stamina and durability and is better at using shadow clones/rasengan.",

I don't think Sasuke was bullshitting when he said she was more skilled than he was at 12. He knows his skill set better than anyone. \n\nThis will probably get me massively downvoted, but I think both Boruto and Sarada have shown to be more skilled than their father's at that age. I'm not saying stronger, but in raw skill? Yeah. The next generation has the edge in that regard because they have more resources.",

What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

Guy in base was able to quite literally just slap Gaara\u2019s sand away. \n\nNaruto also just woke him up after Gaara relinquished control to Sukaku which expended all of Gaara\u2019s chakra. Both he and Naruto were totally out and Gaara just gave up after because Naruto made him have a change of heart. Naruto DID win that fight, but he didn\u2019t really beat him with like power or anything. They both just ran out of chakra. \n\nIn raw power, Naruto would still likely beat Boruto, but Boruto\u2019s also incredibly clever and way more skilled, he could potentially outplay Naruto and win even in a serious fight. Kinda like how Naruto and Gamabunta outplayed Shukaku despite being way weaker than him.",

Gaara was just bloodlusted and was focused on lee and stopped when guy stepped in.  Guy also just slapped away sand that was going to crush an already captured lee. He didn't actually stop  a high speed attack or anything. Also its shown that gaaras biggest weakness is his lack of speed. We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically. But naruto has obviously WAY more stamina and durability and is better at using shadow clones/rasengan.",

I don't think Sasuke was bullshitting when he said she was more skilled than he was at 12. He knows his skill set better than anyone. \n\nThis will probably get me massively downvoted, but I think both Boruto and Sarada have shown to be more skilled than their father's at that age.

What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

Naruto DID win that fight, but he didn\u2019t really beat him with like power or anything.

Also its shown that gaaras biggest weakness is his lack of speed. We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically.

What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically.

He knows his skill set better than anyone. \n\nThis will probably get me massively downvoted, but I think both Boruto and Sarada have shown to be more skilled than their father's at that age. I'm not saying stronger, but in raw skill? Yeah. The next generation has the edge in that regard because they have more resources.",

What point are you trying to make by that? Having power doesn't make you weak, you say Naruto can make all that clones because of his chakra like it's a bad thing... bro, you don't only make clones, you need to maintain them and Naruto maintained a minimum of 2000, while he had to hold back chakra to maintain kurama seal, the original arguement is about who can beat who, kid naruto or kid boruto, I say kid Naruto has kid Boruto beat, even with his karma and jougan, kurama plus you avoided the point where I said naruto outsmarted zabuza, a jonin, naruto isn't as dumb as you think, boruto is smarter for sure but naruto is pretty smart when it counts, and on top of that he's got way more chakra than boruto, I did forget about garaga, but boruto doesn't have a pact with any summoning animals yet like naruto did",

Guy also just slapped away sand that was going to crush an already captured lee. He didn't actually stop  a high speed attack or anything. Also its shown that gaaras biggest weakness is his lack of speed. We can say pretty confidently that he should be as strong as a decent jonin anyway considering his feats back then and the fact that he was kage within like 2-3 years of that exam.\n\nBut also naruto did beat gaara in the fight too. He was able to fight with gaara in shukaku form until he woke him up and gaara was out of chakra. At worst it was a draw before talk no jutsu.\n\nAnd yeah boruto should be more refined basically. But naruto has obviously WAY more stamina and durability and is better at using shadow clones/rasengan.",
