    "body": "Sugaring has created so many opportunities for me and I\u2019m becoming an even better version of my best self. To do well in this lifestyle you really need to maintain a healthy mind-body-spirit. I\u2019m loving the abundance of self-care that I\u2019ve been delving into recently: mani-pedis, massages, joining a gym, being outside, therapy, eating well, and other v fun new hobbies. I\u2019m enjoy my own company a lot more. And other aspects of my life have flourished. I get my work and school work done early so I can have uninterrupted quality time with my SDs (normally I\u2019m a procrastinating perfectionist). I actually set aside time to socialize with my family and friends now, whereas in the past I hated scheduling social things. I realize how important time is, and I don\u2019t want to squander it. I no longer accept/do things that do not bring me joy or add value to my life whether it\u2019s personally or professionally. I\u2019ve also been able to pay for my grad program semester balance in full, bought a new phone, am slowly chipping away at my student loan debt from undergrad, bought stocks, and socked away some funds into my 403b. And I\u2019m learning more about my body and what brings me pleasure and how I want to be romanced. I\u2019m so happy with my older SD!!\n\nEdit: Another favorite aspect of sugar is that I\u2019m almost never on my phone (which is usually such a time suck). I try to be present and will put my phone on do-not-disturb or airplane mode so that my SD has all my attention. It\u2019s nice to get away and be present in the moment. And young ladies take note - you don\u2019t want to perpetuate the idea that all young millennials/gen z are obsessed with their phone/social media/selfies/etc. Also let\u2019s him know that you aren\u2019t fussing about how much time has passed and are enjoying his company.\n\nEdit 2: loll UN-interrupted quality time !!",
