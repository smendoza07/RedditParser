And her technique considerably shortens her lifespan, which is why it's a good thing that she can't use it all the time. I mean, she's only in her early 50s by the start of the show, but she looks much older when her henge falls.\n\nSo it would stand to reason that Hashirama, who couldn't turn his technique off, and was using it repeatedly, would live a considerably shorter lifespan. From what I understand, I don't even think the guy cleared 40.",

He was also defensive the majority of the time. \n\nThe final valley battle goes like this \n1. Madara attacks Hashirama \n2. Hashirama blocks or massively over powers every attack Madara threw at him\n3. Hashirama tells Madara to stop or else\n4. Repeat a few times. \n\nAt no point in the Final Valley battle did Madara have the upper hand. I could be wrong, but I believe the scene you\u2019re referring to is when they both cross the river to attack each other and hashirama is downed. Turned out that the downed Hashirama was a clone.

And her technique considerably shortens her lifespan, which is why it's a good thing that she can't use it all the time. I mean, she's only in her early 50s by the start of the show, but she looks much older when her henge falls.\n\nSo it would stand to reason that Hashirama, who couldn't turn his technique off, and was using it repeatedly, would live a considerably shorter lifespan.

Hashirama had been holding back the entire time in the Final Valley battle hoping Madara would cease his attack. Hashirama did make it a battle of stamina. He was also defensive the majority of the time. \n\nThe final valley battle goes like this \n1. Madara attacks Hashirama \n2. Hashirama blocks or massively over powers every attack Madara threw at him\n3. Hashirama tells Madara to stop or else\n4. Repeat a few times. \n\nAt no point in the Final Valley battle did Madara have the upper hand. I could be wrong, but I believe the scene you\u2019re referring to is when they both cross the river to attack each other and hashirama is downed. Turned out that the downed Hashirama was a clone.

Because he wasn\u2019t necessarily beating him.\n\n\n\nWe know his wood style is good for taking out the susannoo and for taking out the 9 tails. Both very large entities \n\nBut every time we saw them right as humans it was hands (or sword and fan)  Madara was most definitely whooping his ass in hand to hand combat. can\u2019t convince me other wise tbh",

Hashirama had been holding back the entire time in the Final Valley battle hoping Madara would cease his attack. Hashirama did make it a battle of stamina. He was also defensive the majority of the time. \n\nThe final valley battle goes like this \n1. Madara attacks Hashirama \n2. Hashirama blocks or massively over powers every attack Madara threw at him\n3. Hashirama tells Madara to stop or else\n4. Repeat a few times. \n\nAt no point in the Final Valley battle did Madara have the upper hand. I could be wrong, but I believe the scene you\u2019re referring to is when they both cross the river to attack each other and hashirama is downed. Turned out that the downed Hashirama was a clone. The real hashirama snuck behind an exhausted Madara who\u2019s Sharigan had just faded away due to exhaustion.",

He was also defensive the majority of the time. \n\nThe final valley battle goes like this \n1. Madara attacks Hashirama \n2. Hashirama blocks or massively over powers every attack Madara threw at him\n3. Hashirama tells Madara to stop or else\n4. Repeat a few times. \n\nAt no point in the Final Valley battle did Madara have the upper hand. I could be wrong, but I believe the scene you\u2019re referring to is when they both cross the river to attack each other and hashirama is downed. Turned out that the downed Hashirama was a clone.
