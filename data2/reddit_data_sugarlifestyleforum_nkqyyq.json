Or less than .0005.\n\nIf you also consider that the vast majority of HIV positive people probably fall in demographics you're unlikely to interact with, and that if you're engaging in strictly hetero or strictly homo-sexual activity that further reduces the number of possible infected partners to potentially half that number, your odds of winning a major lottery prize are far better than interacting with someone that is unaware they have HIV.  Finally the rates of transmission from hetero vaginal sex is far less than anal sex.\n\nYou're now at .000025 or less.  You are far more likely to die by covid, auto accident..  and i wouldn't be surprised if dying in an airplane crash wasn't more likely.\n\nNot to say that you shouldn't take sensible precautions, including condoms... but I wouldn't be paranoid about HIV even if you don't.  Plus condoms reduce pregnancy risk and other STI's, but HIV is such a small risk in the US with standard sex that using this as an excuse is silly.",

(Vaccination can be started at age 9.)  \nACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated previously. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.  \nVaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults ages 27 through 45 years may decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.  \nFor adults ages 27 through 45 years, clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with people who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most  adults over age 26 years.",

Fuck outta here! \n\nLastly (yes, this is firing me up), there are spermicidal sponges, but I've never heard of spermicidal lube?! If this is a genuine thing somewhere, it does actually mess with your pH and irritates your vaginal lining... so, it would, in fact, make you more vulnerable to STI's.\n\nWork on your boundaries and stand firm as I know many SD's can be like this \u2665",

Never trust anyone when it comes to these things always see the paperwork.

Or less than .0005.\n\nIf you also consider that the vast majority of HIV positive people probably fall in demographics you're unlikely to interact with, and that if you're engaging in strictly hetero or strictly homo-sexual activity that further reduces the number of possible infected partners to potentially half that number, your odds of winning a major lottery prize are far better than interacting with someone that is unaware they have HIV.  Finally the rates of transmission from hetero vaginal sex is far less than anal sex.\n\nYou're now at .000025 or less.  You are far more likely to die by covid, auto accident..  and i wouldn't be surprised if dying in an airplane crash wasn't more likely.\n\nNot to say that you shouldn't take sensible precautions, including condoms... but I wouldn't be paranoid about HIV even if you don't.  Plus condoms reduce pregnancy risk and other STI's, but HIV is such a small risk in the US with standard sex that using this as an excuse is silly.",

(Vaccination can be started at age 9.)  \nACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated previously. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.  \nVaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults ages 27 through 45 years may decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.  \nFor adults ages 27 through 45 years, clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with people who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most  adults over age 26 years.",

(Vaccination can be started at age 9.)  \nACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated previously. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.  \nVaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults ages 27 through 45 years may decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.  \nFor adults ages 27 through 45 years, clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with people who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most  adults over age 26 years.",

(Vaccination can be started at age 9.)  \nACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated previously. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.  \nVaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults ages 27 through 45 years may decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.  \nFor adults ages 27 through 45 years, clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with people who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most  adults over age 26 years.",
