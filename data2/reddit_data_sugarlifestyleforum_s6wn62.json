    "body": "This is in reference to several recent threads where the SD clearly had no understanding of how female attraction works, and suffered the consequences (being ghosted, blown off, etc).\n\nAn SR is a romantic/ sexual relationship. \n\nThe direct exchange of money (sugar) doesn't absolve men from needing to present as attractive, in whatever way that means to the SD. It seems some (not all) men in this lifestyle think that just offering a wallet is enough to guarantee the attention of attractive, young women. (It's not.)\n\nFor the best possible experience, SDs should invest time, energy, & resources into being as physically/ emotionally attractive as possible. Including: grooming & style, building a body you are proud of, learning how women feel sexual attraction, and doing those actions. As well as not doing other actions that turn women off (oversharing, texting every day for weeks like girlfriends, being unattractive, etc.)\n\nImo, men who struggle with women in non-sugar dating, will have the same problems in SR until the core issues are addressed, and overcome. \n\nResources I recommend are working with a personal trainer, getting fashion/ image advice, reading books about seduction (Crucial). I have a list of 3 books all men should read on this topic, DM me if interested.",

To me romance is part of the fun of sugar, and in any relationship romance is about learning your partner's likes, dislikes, wants, needs, and focusing on giving them those things that make them feel appreciated and seen and safe with you. If you're all up in your own ego, fat chance of this happening, and your relationship is probably doomed.\n\nMoney, in general, isn't going to paper over much of anything besides need for food and shelter, but it doesn't fix deeper seeded issues or any hole in one's life. There are many people who need to work on themselves before they are ready for *any* kind of meaningful romantic relationship.",

That's true of every community everywhere, from my experience.   You'd think someone who advocates for understanding others, would understand this \ud83d\ude04\n\nOkay, snark aside, I'm solidly on team romance-your-SB.  But, then again, I like doing that, it's part of what sugar brings to me.  Someone to look good for, someone to romance, this is all my personal choice and I love doing it.  I would observe that it's factually untrue that this is really **necessary** \\-- Certainly there are physically and personality unattractive SDs with beautiful SBs, proving that money does address these shortcomings (to an extent, for some SBs).  But I am strongly with the basic premise, at least for myself; if anything, I appreciate the opportunities I have with unbelievably desirable women that financial support brings, now I still need to do all the work to make her love being in an SR with me.  That's MUCH more than physical and sexual attraction.\n\nThat said, I do think the community is justified in poking at this a bit.  In this case, two things you've said:\n\n>A frenzy as in women being angry about the books I suggest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have a saying, \"Women can smell \ud83d\udc08 on a man, and they like it.\"\n\nIt's a basic fact of nature that when someone is desired by many, they become more desirable.  But when people describe using that fact as a strategy to manipulate others -- well, I've only seen that in certain men's communities that aren't well respected here or especially among women.  And that makes me wonder why women would get *angry* about the books you suggest.  Your almost sole focus on physical attraction for the SD, rather than the many other qualities that delight SBs, is also a hallmark of some of these communities.  Maybe these are unrelated and it's nothing; it's just hard to imagine why the women would be so angry at the books.\n\nBut back to the premise: yes, I personally choose to put in effort to look good for, and romance, my SB.  I enjoy it just for itself, as a gesture; but it does pay dividends IMO",

He said in an arrangement that isn't necessary. I gave up a literal whale for the reasons described in this post so yes, it was absolutely necessary to say. The haters are just being triggered and with good reason. You can't just throw money at someone and expect it to fill in all the gaps. And my SD was younger, fit, attractive, fun, hilarious, a great lay etc. But in the end he wanted something very empty, and so I blocked him.",

I've been on plenty of dates where the spark (whether for her or me) just wasn't there. And there was nothing \"wrong\" with either of us. Just sometimes isn't there despite best efforts. I learned a long time ago not everyone is interested in everyone and that's ok.\n\nI'll also raise the bar and say that SRs are not a solution to a women's financial problems - often self inflicted. Plenty of SBs feel their time is more valuable than the SDs and its not true. There are similar steps an SB can take to be well presented and engaged during a date and be open to building a relationship/arrangement.  And recognize that \"hotness\" or having a pussy does not entitle you to my time, money, respect, or deference.\n\nI'll be glad to DM with any SB to give her my \"do not do this\" list. These include being late to dates, diddling on phone the entire time, one word answers, personal attacks on the SD, demands and requests you would never make of another human being, especially one that you would consider a friend or at least one you want to have a functional, professional, financial relationship with.",

That doesn\u2019t make one way better or worse. As we look at different SR we have to consider that there are people (SDs and SBs alike) that don\u2019t have the desire or the capacity or the ability for romance or emotional intimacy. For some, it\u2019s just not in their personality, others have been hurt so deeply and irreparably that the very thought of such vulnerability could send them into a panic attack! But that doesn\u2019t negate the need for physical intimacy and contact. A sugar relationship is actually the best solution! It\u2019s not meaningless whore hopping (NOT saying that the pros have no feelings! Nor am I trying to shame those girls, but from my conversations, those interactions are, typically, purely physical). A SR creates a safe space where SDs and SBs alike can create a physical connection with a safe relational connection, mutually caring for each other without the demand of romance. \nObviously there are thousands upon thousands of situations, every one is different! I am NOT saying this is the only reason some people do not want romance, only giving one possibility to showcase how the reasons for a SR vary from person to person. \nSo, perhaps, instead of insisting that every SD romance their SB, we should be encouraging clear and forthright communication of expectations, desires and needs. Not every SB is a good fit for the \u201cromance-less\u201d sugar relationship, it takes a certain maturity and selflessness to recognize and understand the necessity and the role of this kind of connection and arrangement. But at the end of the day there truly is someone for everyone. \n\nIn summation, I strongly agree that giving sugar does not absolve a man from being a gentleman and treating his SB with respect and care. I disagree that a SR is always romantic. Demanding the provision of romance could be detrimental or even harmful. \nFinally, as in ANY relationship (vanilla, sugar, familial, professional, etc.) communication is vital. Communicate clearly, openly and honestly, and may the odds be ever in your favor!",

An SR is the perfect solution for a single SD (like me) who knows he will:\n\n\\- never get married\n\n\\- doesn't do PPM\n\n\\- can't risk doing anything illegal (see: Robert Kraft), because of risk to business reputation\n\n\\- doesn't want kids\n\n\\- will only ever want to be with women who are in their 20s and early 30s\n\n\\- wants to avoid at all costs, the financial risks of alimony and child support\n\nSR's are the perfect solution to all of these problems: lawful, best ROI, hottest women, lowest risk",

Many are simply paying because they lack the physical and personality traits to date good looking women \n\nLastly if you think every gal who is on seeking is an A in terms of looks, body, fitness, manners, grace then look again.

(It's not.)\n\nFor some SBs it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For the best possible experience, SDs should invest time, energy, & resources into being as physically/ emotionally attractive as possible. Including: grooming & style, building a body you are proud of, learning how women feel sexual attraction, and doing those actions.\n\nIt takes more, much more, than sexual attraction to make a good SR. You seem to concentrate primarily on the physical/sexual. I think that it's equally important to be attractive personality-wise, psychologically, emotionally, intellectually. I believe that my SB would agree. At 68, and having been told by my doctor two weeks ago for the first time in my life to lose some weight, I'm far from the most physically attractive SD that she could find. Yet we have a great SR, and she enjoys being with me, both in and out of bed.  \n\n\n>Imo, men who struggle with women in non-sugar dating, will have the same problems in SR . . . .\n\nI agree, regardless of what type of problem a guy has. IMO Sugar dating isn't really that different from vanilla dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Resources I recommend are working with a personal trainer, getting fashion/ image advice, reading books about seduction (Crucial).\n\nAgain, you're concentrating on the physical. It's equally important to have good manners, be happy, friendly, stable, consistent, reliable, honest, and more.",

I agree with most of OP's points, as I'm always a little irritated by people in this sub who act as if sugar dating is something completely different from dating. It is a form of dating and all the qualities that are important in vanilla dating are also important here (just maybe to a different extend).\n\nBut OP's post also comes off as self-promotional. And I don't like that. A few days ago in another comment, he told us that he recorded a podcast about his SR experience and asked for DMs (for a link), too. His primary audience seem to be SDs, not SBs, and I don't see why these books shouldn't be of interest for SBs, too. Is all of this just to get in contact with SDs/ presumably rich people? Maybe, OP could just explain himself a little.",
