But I'll try to sum it up in a few posts.\n\n* Not everyone needs a FA, and I didn't want to pressure my services onto people.\n* I didn't like the feeling of scoping out people based on their investable assets. \n* The financial institution w/ the Federal Reserve, target inflation rates, fractional banking, and money makers is corrupt. I didn't like being part of it.\n* In my opinion (and everyone in this industry has opinions), cheap ETFs with very low rates are the best way to outperform your peers. Statistically speaking, you can never outperform the market at a large scale. Any outperformance is more likely a statistical anomaly than it is talent. Black Swan by Nassim Taleb would be an appropriate reading for this topic. \n* Many of my peers were money hungry, less than ethical individuals. Keep in mind, that's not all of them, but some of them.\n\nSo that being said, there is a role for financial advisors and I would have been more comfortable if I had been paid a fee for my time, rather than a fee based on their portfolio. Similar to a lawyer works. That way people with smaller portfolios and larger portfolios would be treated the same and my incentives wouldn't be modified.\n\nTL;DR: It wasn't a good fit for me.",

I've been growing mine out what seems forever now, I have really thick hair, and it comes down to almost my chin in the front. I used to shave the sides but have stopped and am letting that catch up, but I want to get it long enough to put into a bun like you have...but it seems like I'll never get there.",

This allowed me more freedom to push the comfort level of what I wanted to wear. \n\nIn addition, I became more knowledgable about style and fashion through the work I was doing with Beardbrand. I was curating photos on our tumblr page and got a lot of inspiration for cool looks. I wanted to emulate those looks.",

I didn't like being part of it.\n* In my opinion (and everyone in this industry has opinions), cheap ETFs with very low rates are the best way to outperform your peers. Statistically speaking, you can never outperform the market at a large scale. Any outperformance is more likely a statistical anomaly than it is talent. Black Swan by Nassim Taleb would be an appropriate reading for this topic. \n* Many of my peers were money hungry, less than ethical individuals. Keep in mind, that's not all of them, but some of them.\n\nSo that being said, there is a role for financial advisors and I would have been more comfortable if I had been paid a fee for my time, rather than a fee based on their portfolio. Similar to a lawyer works. That way people with smaller portfolios and larger portfolios would be treated the same and my incentives wouldn't be modified.\n\nTL;DR: It wasn't a good fit for me.",

I don't like spending a lot of time, so I'd go natural - which didn't always look good. I have been preferring the shorter beard as well.\n\nI became a lot more confident when I grew my beard. I was a lot more shy towards confrontation when I was beardless, but now I'm more likely to stand my ground. If people are being an ass to me, I'll return it. Whereas in the past I would just ignore it. \n\nI don't know if that's a better thing or not, but it does help confidence. ",

So when you start to kiss, you pucker up your lips, which starts to get the stache out of the way. Then rather going straight forward, you come in at a downward motion.

So when you start to kiss, you pucker up your lips, which starts to get the stache out of the way. Then rather going straight forward, you come in at a downward motion. This will help clear the path for lip to lip contact. Probably the most suave and effective way.",
