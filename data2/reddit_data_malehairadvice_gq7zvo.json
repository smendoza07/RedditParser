To be fair though, a lot of us are descendants of the dregs of England anyway.\n\nBack to the haircut though... It's definitely save-able. I've been cutting my own hair for more than nine years. I fade my own hair and I literally haven't stepped foot inside a Barbershop for that whole 9 years.\n\nJust gotta go upwards and kinda flick the clippers out (away from your head) as you go up. Start with the longest clipper guard, and go from the bottom up to the line. Keep changing the clipper guard to a shorter one and continue the technique (flicking up and out) until the harsh line starts to blend.\n\nFuckin laughin mate!",

You can't send all your criminals to a massive island paradise and expect us to become a civilised bunch haha.\n\nFor sure, I haven't spent a cent on haircuts for nearly a decade. My hair grows really fuckin fast too, because it's crazy thick. It's honestly pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Takes me about 20 minutes these days. You just need a big ole shaving mirror to do the back, but preferably one with a handle. You can get one that's shaped kinda like a ping pong bat and they're perfect.\n\nGood luck mate.",

It should look like it's transitioning a little nicer now, but you will need to get rid of the new lines you made.\n3. To get rid of the bottom line, take off the guards and start with the lever closed and just flick at the bottom line to get it to start disappearing. You can slowly start opening the lever and go up a bit higher until you can't see it anymore.\n4. #1 closed and same thing, flick at the next line you made. \n\nGoodluck mate, plenty of videos on YouTube that do a much better job at explaining this than I did",

To be fair though, a lot of us are descendants of the dregs of England anyway.\n\nBack to the haircut though... It's definitely save-able. I've been cutting my own hair for more than nine years. I fade my own hair and I literally haven't stepped foot inside a Barbershop for that whole 9 years.\n\nJust gotta go upwards and kinda flick the clippers out (away from your head) as you go up. Start with the longest clipper guard, and go from the bottom up to the line. Keep changing the clipper guard to a shorter one and continue the technique (flicking up and out) until the harsh line starts to blend.\n\nFuckin laughin mate!",

You can't send all your criminals to a massive island paradise and expect us to become a civilised bunch haha.\n\nFor sure, I haven't spent a cent on haircuts for nearly a decade. My hair grows really fuckin fast too, because it's crazy thick. It's honestly pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Takes me about 20 minutes these days. You just need a big ole shaving mirror to do the back, but preferably one with a handle. You can get one that's shaped kinda like a ping pong bat and they're perfect.\n\nGood luck mate.",

To be fair though, a lot of us are descendants of the dregs of England anyway.\n\nBack to the haircut though... It's definitely save-able. I've been cutting my own hair for more than nine years. I fade my own hair and I literally haven't stepped foot inside a Barbershop for that whole 9 years.\n\nJust gotta go upwards and kinda flick the clippers out (away from your head) as you go up. Start with the longest clipper guard, and go from the bottom up to the line. Keep changing the clipper guard to a shorter one and continue the technique (flicking up and out) until the harsh line starts to blend.\n\nFuckin laughin mate!",

You can't send all your criminals to a massive island paradise and expect us to become a civilised bunch haha.\n\nFor sure, I haven't spent a cent on haircuts for nearly a decade. My hair grows really fuckin fast too, because it's crazy thick. It's honestly pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Takes me about 20 minutes these days. You just need a big ole shaving mirror to do the back, but preferably one with a handle. You can get one that's shaped kinda like a ping pong bat and they're perfect.\n\nGood luck mate.",

You can't send all your criminals to a massive island paradise and expect us to become a civilised bunch haha.\n\nFor sure, I haven't spent a cent on haircuts for nearly a decade. My hair grows really fuckin fast too, because it's crazy thick. It's honestly pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Takes me about 20 minutes these days. You just need a big ole shaving mirror to do the back, but preferably one with a handle. You can get one that's shaped kinda like a ping pong bat and they're perfect.\n\nGood luck mate.",
