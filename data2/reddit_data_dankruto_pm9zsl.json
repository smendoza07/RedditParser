Obito wanted to remove suffering for the entire world, not just himself.\n\nHe had a horrifically warped hero complex in that he didn't want what he considered \"hell\" to persist anymore. He had genuinely thought his aim justified the means. This was the effect of taking his sense of wanting to be the [good guy that everyone looks up to(Hokage)](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/hymnia/1494230/7160/600.jpg) and being manipulated by [Madara into the twisted version of a saviour for the world](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dd9a808993babacf4488e9290f408dd1).\n\nWhat ended up making Obito so interesting is that it's been hinted throughout the series that he has his doubts about the plan and that the old Obito is still in there, we see this through him regularly visiting the Konoha graves when it would provide no advantage to him and only risk him being caught. \n\nWe also see him projecting himself onto Naruto, and trying to break down Naruto purely to justify the old him not being enough to save the world. Naruto proves Obito wrong and shows Obito that there is a different viable route to peace.\n\nObito's character is constantly shown to be a simp tho which is funny but his [character's motivations wasn't actually all about rin](https://external-preview.redd.it/H-NHrHArRaufWLpd-lOokrlgZET20kLcH9dc9KBITxU.png?auto=webp&s=edb9dc6ea9c592bdb7803668b4c62a921f98e7c3) ahaha. She was more like the straw that broke the camels back leaving Obito emotionally vulnerable to be manipulated by Madara.",

If they just let Madara win, they wouldve gotten basically the same outcome. And then on top of that, now they have Juubidara and Obito as combatants for when Toneri, Momoshiki, Jigen and eventually the next op villain are to appear, which means Naruto and Sasuke won't have to get clapped as hard and Naruto won't have to use KCM3. So yeah, the world probably would've been better off if Madara won, but I cant say for sure",

He might confront Black Zetsu about the true purpose of the tree, but it's not like the tree wasn't also doing exactly what Madara hoped it would do. \n\nMadara's plan was to place everyone into their individual paradise genjutsu until they died, thus guaranteeing peace for the final generation of humans on the planet. The tree might kill its victims quicker than Madara supposed, but it's not like Madara was trying to make everyone immortal (at least he never makes such a claim). And powerful genjutsu can alter the victim's sense of the passage of time, so it's possible that the victims of TS would still imagine themselves living full and complete lives in paradise before finally fading away.",

Though it\u2019s probably more effective given that people like Tenten and Yamato realized they were in a genjutsu but eventually succumbed to their dreams. \n\nI guess this is all just a roundabout way of saying that you\u2019re pretty much correct that there\u2019s really no downsides (unless you count being turned into Zetsu or fruit)",

If they just let Madara win, they wouldve gotten basically the same outcome. And then on top of that, now they have Juubidara and Obito as combatants for when Toneri, Momoshiki, Jigen and eventually the next op villain are to appear, which means Naruto and Sasuke won't have to get clapped as hard and Naruto won't have to use KCM3. So yeah, the world probably would've been better off if Madara won, but I cant say for sure",

The tree might kill its victims quicker than Madara supposed, but it's not like Madara was trying to make everyone immortal (at least he never makes such a claim). And powerful genjutsu can alter the victim's sense of the passage of time, so it's possible that the victims of TS would still imagine themselves living full and complete lives in paradise before finally fading away.",

If they just let Madara win, they wouldve gotten basically the same outcome. And then on top of that, now they have Juubidara and Obito as combatants for when Toneri, Momoshiki, Jigen and eventually the next op villain are to appear, which means Naruto and Sasuke won't have to get clapped as hard and Naruto won't have to use KCM3. So yeah, the world probably would've been better off if Madara won, but I cant say for sure",

He might confront Black Zetsu about the true purpose of the tree, but it's not like the tree wasn't also doing exactly what Madara hoped it would do. \n\nMadara's plan was to place everyone into their individual paradise genjutsu until they died, thus guaranteeing peace for the final generation of humans on the planet. The tree might kill its victims quicker than Madara supposed, but it's not like Madara was trying to make everyone immortal (at least he never makes such a claim). And powerful genjutsu can alter the victim's sense of the passage of time, so it's possible that the victims of TS would still imagine themselves living full and complete lives in paradise before finally fading away.",

Though it\u2019s probably more effective given that people like Tenten and Yamato realized they were in a genjutsu but eventually succumbed to their dreams. \n\nI guess this is all just a roundabout way of saying that you\u2019re pretty much correct that there\u2019s really no downsides (unless you count being turned into Zetsu or fruit)",

If they just let Madara win, they wouldve gotten basically the same outcome. And then on top of that, now they have Juubidara and Obito as combatants for when Toneri, Momoshiki, Jigen and eventually the next op villain are to appear, which means Naruto and Sasuke won't have to get clapped as hard and Naruto won't have to use KCM3. So yeah, the world probably would've been better off if Madara won, but I cant say for sure",

The tree might kill its victims quicker than Madara supposed, but it's not like Madara was trying to make everyone immortal (at least he never makes such a claim). And powerful genjutsu can alter the victim's sense of the passage of time, so it's possible that the victims of TS would still imagine themselves living full and complete lives in paradise before finally fading away.",

Though it\u2019s probably more effective given that people like Tenten and Yamato realized they were in a genjutsu but eventually succumbed to their dreams. \n\nI guess this is all just a roundabout way of saying that you\u2019re pretty much correct that there\u2019s really no downsides (unless you count being turned into Zetsu or fruit)",

If they just let Madara win, they wouldve gotten basically the same outcome. And then on top of that, now they have Juubidara and Obito as combatants for when Toneri, Momoshiki, Jigen and eventually the next op villain are to appear, which means Naruto and Sasuke won't have to get clapped as hard and Naruto won't have to use KCM3. So yeah, the world probably would've been better off if Madara won, but I cant say for sure",

He might confront Black Zetsu about the true purpose of the tree, but it's not like the tree wasn't also doing exactly what Madara hoped it would do. \n\nMadara's plan was to place everyone into their individual paradise genjutsu until they died, thus guaranteeing peace for the final generation of humans on the planet. The tree might kill its victims quicker than Madara supposed, but it's not like Madara was trying to make everyone immortal (at least he never makes such a claim). And powerful genjutsu can alter the victim's sense of the passage of time, so it's possible that the victims of TS would still imagine themselves living full and complete lives in paradise before finally fading away.",

Though it\u2019s probably more effective given that people like Tenten and Yamato realized they were in a genjutsu but eventually succumbed to their dreams. \n\nI guess this is all just a roundabout way of saying that you\u2019re pretty much correct that there\u2019s really no downsides (unless you count being turned into Zetsu or fruit)",

He might confront Black Zetsu about the true purpose of the tree, but it's not like the tree wasn't also doing exactly what Madara hoped it would do. \n\nMadara's plan was to place everyone into their individual paradise genjutsu until they died, thus guaranteeing peace for the final generation of humans on the planet. The tree might kill its victims quicker than Madara supposed, but it's not like Madara was trying to make everyone immortal (at least he never makes such a claim). And powerful genjutsu can alter the victim's sense of the passage of time, so it's possible that the victims of TS would still imagine themselves living full and complete lives in paradise before finally fading away.",
