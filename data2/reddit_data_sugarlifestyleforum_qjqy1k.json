I sometimes wonder if telling people that \"I don't want it to be transactional\" or \"I know my worth\" are red flags, is just us teaching those people how to disguise themselves for longer.  There's any number of sentiments that indicate an SB is not a match for me, that I want them to put loud and proud on their profiles rather than making me discover it down the line.\n\nSomeone asking this \"would you be with me if I weren't paying\" isn't in a great place.  Maybe it's better that they DO verbalize it, so you can help give some clarity before they end up in an even worse place.  So maybe you both win -- either you succeed at giving him the clarity he needs before he gets too deep in the feels and he's able to pull himself back from the precipice, or he ends things now before they get toxic and extremely unpleasant.\n\nMy response to \"would you still be here if I gained 70 pounds\", from an SB I\"d been with a long time, would be along the lines of (I actually had a conversation along these lines with a long-term SB, that happened organically): I genuinely enjoy and adore everything about you, and I'd want you in my life no matter what.  But if I'm not sexually attracted, then it would be a friendship instead of a sugar relationship, and I wouldn't expect sex and support to be part of it\".\n\nOf course, I meant the \"I'd want you in my life no matter what\", and in many cases I realize SBs might not feel the same",
