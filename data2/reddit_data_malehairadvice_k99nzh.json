This happened a few more times in my 20\u2019s when I tried to grow it out.  I would just cut it all off due to frizz and maintenance.  Now, I just passed the 2 year mark since my last haircut and it almost rests on my shoulders. r/curlyhair is your best friend. The maintenance can actually be pretty simple. It\u2019s all about choosing the right products and applying the right methods. It took me 10 years to figure that out. You definitely have the type of hair that will hang down after time. It really does just take patience.",
