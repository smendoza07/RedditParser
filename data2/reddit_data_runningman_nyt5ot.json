It\u2019s natural for people to feel that way and it\u2019s ok, but you\u2019re undervaluing the potential of other members to carry the show. \n\nPeople should go through this like a grievance process, and take time to heal and accept that he\u2019s gone, but people shouldn\u2019t abandon the show because of one person (albeit he is a really major factor). I\u2019m not one to call you out, but wouldnt you want to respect the wish of a dead person? (In analogy of grievance and death to him leaving) as KWS is leaving he even says to please continue to support and watch the show. I believe KWS wouldn\u2019t want RM\u2019s fans to abandon the show because of his absence\n\nHear me out. IF, and this is a big IF, what if numerous amount of people feel this way, ratings would go down, a lot of people are then turned off by KWS leaving the show, turning into a possible cancellation of the show. It\u2019s all cascading causality.\n\nThat\u2019s why I encourage people to continue to support and watch. This has been seen before with the resignation of Gary. There was that dip in ratings all because they felt that RM couldn\u2019t continue without him, and then RM reforms and got back on its feet. BUT if people continue to watch as if nothing has changed, then they could avoid that \u201cdip\u201d in ratings\n\nHeal first then accept his absence and RM will continue to provide you with more awesome memories",
