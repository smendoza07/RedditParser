    "body": "He died in a car wreck this past weekend. He was only 56. I\u2019m  absolutely broken and have no one to talk to about it because no one knows I was doing this. I don\u2019t even feel comfortable attending his funeral because he has a wife and kids. I don\u2019t know what to do aside from cry by myself and try my very hardest to seem okay. This is the hardest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me and I can\u2019t tell anyone. On top of all that, our arrangement was my only source of income, I have no real skills and I\u2019m definitely not ready to have another SD for a long time. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to cope.",

I had an SB of mine die in a car accident a couple years ago, her and her roommate  hit an 18 wheeler head on.  I so wanted to go to the memorial and funeral, but damn, how do I explain who I am and why I was missing her so bad.... Settled for a visit to her grave a few weeks after her headstone was erected.  Maybe something like that can help you, it was OK for me to sit and talk in my mind to her, sitting on the grass next to the stone.",

She stayed friends with the SB, and was the one to call and tell me.  I had just talked to SB the night before, after midnite, coming back from a business dinner, she wanted me to come get her.  I knew she was leaving early next morning for a trip, we decided, to wait until she returned.\n\nI blamed myself a bit, thinking at the time, if I had went to get her, it might have changed things.  Later, I came to accept, that when it is your day/time to go, there is nothing a mortal being can do to change it, its simply your time.  I think about her often, and am glad for the few months we had.\n\nOP, I am sad for you too, I'll share one more tidbit that I hope can help you.  I went into a bit of a funk after SB passed.  A few weeks later, I met the best SB I ever had.  I would probably not have met her and had the two years with her I did, if I was spending it with the deceased SB.  I hope you find another special someone somewhere soon.  Life closes one door, and opens others.  We have to lift our heads up though, to see the paths and make the choices.",

I've gone through some catastrophic grief and hopeless times and not been able to talk to rl social circle or family, but friends I knew online through various communities were able to provide me with some emotional support at my worst times. It was honestly a lifesaver having an outlet like that, even if it isn't quite the same as having support from those closer. In fact in some ways it was better as there was no other baggage there. Of course general safety still applies ESPECIALLY as you are so vulnerable (Yes, I mostly mean watch out for skeezy men), but there are decent people who don't like to see people suffer alone.",

I know you haven't discussed your situation but do you have close bonds with people you could rely on to bring it up?\n\nBecause your job right now is processing and getting through the next 1-2 weeks. I get that you have other things to deal with and figure out but if it's at all possible I'd try to reduce the cognitive load on yourself and just make it through, walk your dogs, talk to people, cry.

Even gas stations are paying $15 an hour.  No benefits though usually, a therapist is usually expensive so you may want to put that on hold if you can manage.\n\nThe job hunt and job will take your mind off the loss. So hop to it. \n\nI would still go to funeral you can sit and back and sneak out you dont have to say anything more than I work with him once or white lie how you met but thst he helped you in some way and you are forever grateful like you are.\n\nNever have sugar be you only source of income, it changes the dynamics and your independence, \n\nAnd you should make a emergency fund your first goal with job, ie 6 ,,months of expenses, its hard but you will appreciate the sence of security once achieved.\n\nWhat I can tell you from experience, time heals the hurt. And distraction is American passtime cause it works.\n\nVirtual hugs",

I personally think if I experienced your situation, I would research different therapists, and psychologists that are SW friendly. I understand not feeling comfortable opening up about this to friends or family. I could only imagine the weight you\u2019re carrying on your shoulders though.. you deserve to feel safe expressing how this has affected you while having someone who is trained and skilled to help you make a plan that works best for for you, and your healing journey. \n\nYou have a plethora of skills and amazing qualities. Maybe a good start would be to think about some things you\u2019re passionate about that you\u2019d be interested in turning into a form of monetization \n^~^ \n\nYou will overcome this, and you have so many supportive kindreds here to remind you of your strength!",

These relationships are secret and so you will need to grieve in secret IMO. Visiting the grave when his family aren't there is what I'd do.",

For your finances you may need to get a job for now. Many companies are hiring. It may not be at the level you're used to but at least it's something till you can recover and try sr again.

Or was it on the news?\n\nI\u2019ve thought about something like this happening to my sd ands it\u2019s terrifying. Mine has been my only source of income for the last 5 years. My situation is obviously much different than yours, but he\u2019s moving to Florida next month with his wife and I have NO clue what I\u2019m going to do at that point. It\u2019s hard to even consider going back to a normal job. Why would I work for 15/hour when I\u2019ve been making hundreds an hour for the last 5 years?  I\u2019ve adapted to this lifestyle and I don\u2019t want things to change, but I don\u2019t really have a choice. \n\nHave you considered meeting new potential sds? I mean, it\u2019s your body and you don\u2019t have to be intimate with them right away, but making friends could bring you happiness and help you cope with your loss. And Later on, you might be able to make an income off of them. \n\nI agree with others about not going to the funeral. As much as you want to pay him your respects, going there will do the complete opposite if his family ends up approaching you. You\u2019re doing the right thing by not going.",

I wanted to talk to him and turn to HIM to mourn & get some sort of comfort over HIS death. Such a weird feeling which I\u2019m sure is common when you lose someone close to you. \n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more about the job thing. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of flack for not having another source of income but if I could not work, enjoy my life and spend it with him and my dogs- why would I work a cafe job that I dread? I do regret not having something though. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that, it sucks. \n\nI have considered a new SD, but I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable being sexual right now and I feel most expect sex sooner than later. I could use a platonic sugar daddy, but it doesn\u2019t seem realistic and I feel insensitive and it feels wrong if I seek one out at this time. \n\nCompletely agree about the funeral.\nThanks for replying \u2764\ufe0f",

Got a text the next afternoon from his SIL, that he\u2019d passed away unexpectedly in his sleep and that she was deleting my messages so his sons wouldn\u2019t see it. His wife passed away of the same type of cancer a few years before. I ended up getting a call from his son as well telling me the news. Turns out that he\u2019d requested in his letter to his son, that I be notified. It gave me a bit of closure. But it definitely hit like a ton of bricks bc he was just genuinely a really nice guy. Only ever wanted private  \u2018dances\u2019, (we met at the club) and helped me out so much so I understand how you feel in that aspect as well, bc he my main income at the time. I was also welcome to the funeral but it was out of town and it just wasn\u2019t possible, I know he would understand so I didn\u2019t feel to much guilt about that. I also felt it was the respectful thing not to go anyways. I never have had anyone really close to me pass away other than a uncle when I was in middle school & my great grandpa recently. So it definitely wasn\u2019t an easy pill to swallow. I hope you\u2019ve been doing okay, and that you find some peace.",

I know you haven't discussed your situation but do you have close bonds with people you could rely on to bring it up?\n\nBecause your job right now is processing and getting through the next 1-2 weeks. I get that you have other things to deal with and figure out but if it's at all possible I'd try to reduce the cognitive load on yourself and just make it through, walk your dogs, talk to people, cry.

Even gas stations are paying $15 an hour.  No benefits though usually, a therapist is usually expensive so you may want to put that on hold if you can manage.\n\nThe job hunt and job will take your mind off the loss. So hop to it. \n\nI would still go to funeral you can sit and back and sneak out you dont have to say anything more than I work with him once or white lie how you met but thst he helped you in some way and you are forever grateful like you are.\n\nNever have sugar be you only source of income, it changes the dynamics and your independence, \n\nAnd you should make a emergency fund your first goal with job, ie 6 ,,months of expenses, its hard but you will appreciate the sence of security once achieved.\n\nWhat I can tell you from experience, time heals the hurt.

Advising this young lady that people won\u2019t be inclined to demand an explanation is foolish. To do that to a grieving family would be really selfish. I understand she would like to be there, but she just can\u2019t. These are the sacrifices we make when we engage in these types of arrangements.",

I wanted to talk to him and turn to HIM to mourn & get some sort of comfort over HIS death. Such a weird feeling which I\u2019m sure is common when you lose someone close to you. \n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more about the job thing. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of flack for not having another source of income but if I could not work, enjoy my life and spend it with him and my dogs- why would I work a cafe job that I dread? I do regret not having something though. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that, it sucks. \n\nI have considered a new SD, but I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable being sexual right now and I feel most expect sex sooner than later. I could use a platonic sugar daddy, but it doesn\u2019t seem realistic and I feel insensitive and it feels wrong if I seek one out at this time. \n\nCompletely agree about the funeral.\nThanks for replying \u2764\ufe0f",

I knew she was leaving early next morning for a trip, we decided, to wait until she returned.\n\nI blamed myself a bit, thinking at the time, if I had went to get her, it might have changed things.  Later, I came to accept, that when it is your day/time to go, there is nothing a mortal being can do to change it, its simply your time.  I think about her often, and am glad for the few months we had.\n\nOP, I am sad for you too, I'll share one more tidbit that I hope can help you.  I went into a bit of a funk after SB passed.  A few weeks later, I met the best SB I ever had.  I would probably not have met her and had the two years with her I did, if I was spending it with the deceased SB.

Even gas stations are paying $15 an hour.  No benefits though usually, a therapist is usually expensive so you may want to put that on hold if you can manage.\n\nThe job hunt and job will take your mind off the loss. So hop to it. \n\nI would still go to funeral you can sit and back and sneak out you dont have to say anything more than I work with him once or white lie how you met but thst he helped you in some way and you are forever grateful like you are.\n\nNever have sugar be you only source of income, it changes the dynamics and your independence, \n\nAnd you should make a emergency fund your first goal with job, ie 6 ,,months of expenses, its hard but you will appreciate the sence of security once achieved.\n\nWhat I can tell you from experience, time heals the hurt. And distraction is American passtime cause it works.\n\nVirtual hugs",
