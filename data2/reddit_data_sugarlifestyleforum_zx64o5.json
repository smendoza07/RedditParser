    "body": "I was on a m&g a few days ago, and it was going well until the POT SD said some really ignorant things. \n\nHe was a 62 year old white guy and I\u2019m a 23 year old asian girl. We are eating in a casual viet restaurant when this happens. About mid way, this convo occurs:\n\nSD: I feel bad for asian girls\n\nMe: Why? \n\nSD: Well, asian guys have such small dicks.\n\nMe: \u2026so?\n\nSD: well keep this a secret, but I only watch asian porn. I love asian women. \n\nMe: *internal eyeroll* *external smile*\n\nSD: and the boys just have such small dicks\n\nMe: Well I mean that\u2019s not really a problem, I mean a lot of asian women are petite and small so even if they do have smaller dicks, it\u2019s not really a problem. \n\nSD: ah well as they say asian women are small because asian men are small.\n\nAnyway I thought this was such an odd thing to say on a date and not exactly true. My ex had a pretty big dick, but I thought I\u2019d just share this moment with you guys. Maybe I should stop going on dates with white old men now.\n\nEDIT: Some guy DM\u2019ed me even more racist stuff \ud83d\ude02 look at my new post to see it\n\nEDIT 2: watching my likes go up and down makes me realise just how many people here think like him\n\nEdit 3: The Dm post was deleted, but I\u2019d be happy to share if you wanted to see it",

I grew up hearing it my entire life by men who entertained Asian women, they see Asian women dating them as the ultimate emasculation and signal that asian men are below any men but especially white men. Which is sad. She\u2019s smart to know a guy who thinks like this also views the women and children as less than too but a lot of Asian women marry these guys anyways which is why too many men are comfortable with voicing this. Because the women allow it and would even tolerate it to escape their backgrounds. It\u2019s also why there\u2019s the cliche that if you want to find the most racist men or most white supremacist men find the man dating or married an Asian woman because no lie from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s true. They often date them as assurance of their superiority.",

I've experienced racism before and it wasn't from white people, it was from the family of my Armenian girlfriend because I wasn't Armenian, but I didn't whine or complain about it. They don't know what real racism is. Western countries are the most race tolerant countries in the world. Asian countries are all 99% Asian and far more racist towards non-Asians than most whites are towards any other race. It's just sad how they respond if you don't agree with them about everything being racist. I've dated Armenian, white, black, and Chinese but these days I'm starting to consider only dating within my own race if people don't start to settle down.",

It's not racist to think all black people have large dicks if every black dick you've seen was large. That's just ignorance, not racism.

I cannot infer that what he said was intended to be race-based hate or not based solely on the text since I wasn't there. Body language, tone, inflection, and context are all important and something only you were witness to. I can only judge based on the description you provided.\n\nIf I said that white people aren't as much fun in the summer because they burn so easily, would that be a race-based hate comment? Is it racist to talk about sickle cell disease because it is genetically tied to a specific race? The guy clearly sounded like an ass and was at best ignorant and at worst racist.

Which is sad. She\u2019s smart to know a guy who thinks like this also views the women and children as less than too but a lot of Asian women marry these guys anyways which is why too many men are comfortable with voicing this. Because the women allow it and would even tolerate it to escape their backgrounds. It\u2019s also why there\u2019s the cliche that if you want to find the most racist men or most white supremacist men find the man dating or married an Asian woman because no lie from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s true.

I've experienced racism before and it wasn't from white people, it was from the family of my Armenian girlfriend because I wasn't Armenian, but I didn't whine or complain about it. They don't know what real racism is. Western countries are the most race tolerant countries in the world. Asian countries are all 99% Asian and far more racist towards non-Asians than most whites are towards any other race. It's just sad how they respond if you don't agree with them about everything being racist. I've dated Armenian, white, black, and Chinese but these days I'm starting to consider only dating within my own race if people don't start to settle down.",

If all he ever watches is Asian porn then he's probably seen hundreds of Asian dicks. If they were all small then you can't blame him for thinking all Asians have small dicks. That's not racism, that's just ignorance. If we set such low standards for labeling people as racist or sexist then I'm sure I could find a reason to label every person on this forum as racist, sexist, or something along those lines.",

Body language, tone, inflection, and context are all important and something only you were witness to. I can only judge based on the description you provided.\n\nIf I said that white people aren't as much fun in the summer because they burn so easily, would that be a race-based hate comment? Is it racist to talk about sickle cell disease because it is genetically tied to a specific race? The guy clearly sounded like an ass and was at best ignorant and at worst racist.

If all he ever watches is Asian porn then he's probably seen hundreds of Asian dicks. If they were all small then you can't blame him for thinking all Asians have small dicks. That's not racism, that's just ignorance.

I was only creating an example to illustrate that the same thing could be said without race being involved. I'm not discussing whether or not the comment was in any way appropriate (it wasn't), only whether or not it was in fact racist or not.\n\nI can only go off of what you described in your original post. I cannot infer that what he said was intended to be race-based hate or not based solely on the text since I wasn't there. Body language, tone, inflection, and context are all important and something only you were witness to. I can only judge based on the description you provided.\n\nIf I said that white people aren't as much fun in the summer because they burn so easily, would that be a race-based hate comment? Is it racist to talk about sickle cell disease because it is genetically tied to a specific race? The guy clearly sounded like an ass and was at best ignorant and at worst racist. I'm not defending him. I just don't think we need to be so hyper sensitive and eager to cry racism anytime race is mentioned. I want to make our degrading race relations better, not worse.

I'm not discussing whether or not the comment was in any way appropriate (it wasn't), only whether or not it was in fact racist or not.\n\nI can only go off of what you described in your original post. I cannot infer that what he said was intended to be race-based hate or not based solely on the text since I wasn't there. Body language, tone, inflection, and context are all important and something only you were witness to. I can only judge based on the description you provided.\n\nIf I said that white people aren't as much fun in the summer because they burn so easily, would that be a race-based hate comment? Is it racist to talk about sickle cell disease because it is genetically tied to a specific race? The guy clearly sounded like an ass and was at best ignorant and at worst racist.

Like I said, I broke up with a girl for similar crude and disrespectful language so it is not something me or any of my friends would say. I was only creating an example to illustrate that the same thing could be said without race being involved. I'm not discussing whether or not the comment was in any way appropriate (it wasn't), only whether or not it was in fact racist or not.\n\nI can only go off of what you described in your original post. I cannot infer that what he said was intended to be race-based hate or not based solely on the text since I wasn't there. Body language, tone, inflection, and context are all important and something only you were witness to. I can only judge based on the description you provided.\n\nIf I said that white people aren't as much fun in the summer because they burn so easily, would that be a race-based hate comment? Is it racist to talk about sickle cell disease because it is genetically tied to a specific race? The guy clearly sounded like an ass and was at best ignorant and at worst racist. I'm not defending him. I just don't think we need to be so hyper sensitive and eager to cry racism anytime race is mentioned. I want to make our degrading race relations better, not worse.
