They did something similar when Ha Seok Jin posted a picture with Somin after he guested on Sixth Sense. Thankfully both Si Yang and Ha Seok Jin continue to comment on Somin's Instagram page.\nThere are certain people instructing Somin fans not to talk about the personal attacks/slander because 'it's not that bad now'. \ud83d\ude44",

I mean, the rest of the cast sure do (JSJ saying we'll get criticized if we attack her), yet they keep silent. It is very difficult to justify this silence and respect the person when numerous people have been attacked because of her. \n\nI've said this before, but I can give accounts of other people sticking up for their co-workers or even people they don't really know so their fans either not attack them or stop. Why go far, prime example of such class act is JSM. She rarely posts pictures with another person before an episode to show off her outfit. When YSC came under fire for his tactless remarks in Ep587, JSM took to her Instagram and posted a picture with him from Ep588. This made a lot of people pull back because this sent the message: \"me and SeChan are good. No need for all you're doing.\" \n\nIt's not that hard to stick up to people. I will never understand how SJH can just look the other way and live with this. I'd be feeling guilty and ashamed all the time. But her fans never consider how what they do makes her feel and look to her co-workers. In fact, her toxic SEA fans might very well be the reason the cast are not close with her/feel uncomfortable with her.\n\nImportant edit: I do not mean to say SJH should feel ashamed or owes anyone anything. I'm saying there is an alternative way to handle it and that if it were me, I would've felt bad.",

Plus, if they all become too competitive and went all out on each other on games, there risks of injuries, and the shooting may be too tiresome (it is actually tiresome as it is).\nSomin when she kind of give up and try not challenging others, specially the male cast, it make it easier for them too. It's not really a good sight and not funny when a guy goes all out on a women during a physical game, and he may be worried himself about the backlash that may result from it from the general public. So, she just let the oppas battle it in between them and step back without making it too obvious (ex: in the grap a chair game a couple of episodes back, you can see her not contesting from the start, eliminated 1st and used her time just dancing to the songs being played).\n\nEven LKS, when he is in a winning mood can contest against anyone, and you can also see KJK being flustered by it multiple times. It's not about who is too strong, cause KJK is obviously number 1, but if he over use his strength he may injure himself or LKS, and that he obviously does not want. Yet, he have an image of being the strongest to protect at the time, and finds himself in a dilemma. \n\nThere are just soo many hidden dynamics and unspoken rules, to make the shooting go smoothly and without incidents, cause they care for each other. Somin's way of helping, is by always taking the initiative, interacting and creating situations where other may join in and not just her (ex: she started the loveline with Sechan to help him out, cause he was falling behind at the time, or lovelines with guests to get them screetime cause they can find the timing to step in or not used to variety shows...). She delivers regular amounts of footage for the pds to edit and choose from. That reduce sometimes even the shooting hours and get the cast to rest earlier.\n\nEdit: wording",

Even asking JSM to deny it and stop the joke but the RM members keep on playing that forbidden love card. The fact that JSJ still wanted to clear things up in the 'Outrun' years after just show how disappointed he was with the joke.

It makes me so angry to read those comments because it isn't them praising this beautiful woman; it's them sexualizing her and her body. As a big-breasted woman myself, I am highly aware of all of this. When I was younger and a lot thinner, I still had large boobs and I kid you not I used to judge men I first met by where they looked first when they saw me. A lot of men glance a look before they even meet your eyes. So seeing people leave those comments about SJH makes me uncomfortable. I don't know if they are her fans or just creeps, but it's immature and rude. Praise her for her beauty and admire it. But don't insult her and other women.",

(This is not a rotten compliment but meant 100% positive)\n- Would like to see both of them together in more non-runningman shows. They are chatty and hilarious in the most random ways.\n- It's crazy how much I have grown to like Suk Jin Hyung over the years and in comparison to the start of RM. He has become a really positive person now",

I mean, the rest of the cast sure do (JSJ saying we'll get criticized if we attack her), yet they keep silent. It is very difficult to justify this silence and respect the person when numerous people have been attacked because of her. \n\nI've said this before, but I can give accounts of other people sticking up for their co-workers or even people they don't really know so their fans either not attack them or stop. Why go far, prime example of such class act is JSM. She rarely posts pictures with another person before an episode to show off her outfit. When YSC came under fire for his tactless remarks in Ep587, JSM took to her Instagram and posted a picture with him from Ep588. This made a lot of people pull back because this sent the message: \"me and SeChan are good. No need for all you're doing.\" \n\nIt's not that hard to stick up to people. I will never understand how SJH can just look the other way and live with this. I'd be feeling guilty and ashamed all the time. But her fans never consider how what they do makes her feel and look to her co-workers. In fact, her toxic SEA fans might very well be the reason the cast are not close with her/feel uncomfortable with her.\n\nImportant edit: I do not mean to say SJH should feel ashamed or owes anyone anything. I'm saying there is an alternative way to handle it and that if it were me, I would've felt bad.",

Plus, if they all become too competitive and went all out on each other on games, there risks of injuries, and the shooting may be too tiresome (it is actually tiresome as it is).\nSomin when she kind of give up and try not challenging others, specially the male cast, it make it easier for them too. It's not really a good sight and not funny when a guy goes all out on a women during a physical game, and he may be worried himself about the backlash that may result from it from the general public. So, she just let the oppas battle it in between them and step back without making it too obvious (ex: in the grap a chair game a couple of episodes back, you can see her not contesting from the start, eliminated 1st and used her time just dancing to the songs being played).\n\nEven LKS, when he is in a winning mood can contest against anyone, and you can also see KJK being flustered by it multiple times. It's not about who is too strong, cause KJK is obviously number 1, but if he over use his strength he may injure himself or LKS, and that he obviously does not want. Yet, he have an image of being the strongest to protect at the time, and finds himself in a dilemma. \n\nThere are just soo many hidden dynamics and unspoken rules, to make the shooting go smoothly and without incidents, cause they care for each other. Somin's way of helping, is by always taking the initiative, interacting and creating situations where other may join in and not just her (ex: she started the loveline with Sechan to help him out, cause he was falling behind at the time, or lovelines with guests to get them screetime cause they can find the timing to step in or not used to variety shows...). She delivers regular amounts of footage for the pds to edit and choose from. That reduce sometimes even the shooting hours and get the cast to rest earlier.\n\nEdit: wording",

It makes me so angry to read those comments because it isn't them praising this beautiful woman; it's them sexualizing her and her body. As a big-breasted woman myself, I am highly aware of all of this. When I was younger and a lot thinner, I still had large boobs and I kid you not I used to judge men I first met by where they looked first when they saw me. A lot of men glance a look before they even meet your eyes. So seeing people leave those comments about SJH makes me uncomfortable. I don't know if they are her fans or just creeps, but it's immature and rude. Praise her for her beauty and admire it. But don't insult her and other women.",

They did something similar when Ha Seok Jin posted a picture with Somin after he guested on Sixth Sense. Thankfully both Si Yang and Ha Seok Jin continue to comment on Somin's Instagram page.\nThere are certain people instructing Somin fans not to talk about the personal attacks/slander because 'it's not that bad now'. \ud83d\ude44",

I mean, the rest of the cast sure do (JSJ saying we'll get criticized if we attack her), yet they keep silent. It is very difficult to justify this silence and respect the person when numerous people have been attacked because of her. \n\nI've said this before, but I can give accounts of other people sticking up for their co-workers or even people they don't really know so their fans either not attack them or stop. Why go far, prime example of such class act is JSM. She rarely posts pictures with another person before an episode to show off her outfit. When YSC came under fire for his tactless remarks in Ep587, JSM took to her Instagram and posted a picture with him from Ep588. This made a lot of people pull back because this sent the message: \"me and SeChan are good. No need for all you're doing.\" \n\nIt's not that hard to stick up to people. I will never understand how SJH can just look the other way and live with this. I'd be feeling guilty and ashamed all the time. But her fans never consider how what they do makes her feel and look to her co-workers. In fact, her toxic SEA fans might very well be the reason the cast are not close with her/feel uncomfortable with her.\n\nImportant edit: I do not mean to say SJH should feel ashamed or owes anyone anything. I'm saying there is an alternative way to handle it and that if it were me, I would've felt bad.",

Plus, if they all become too competitive and went all out on each other on games, there risks of injuries, and the shooting may be too tiresome (it is actually tiresome as it is).\nSomin when she kind of give up and try not challenging others, specially the male cast, it make it easier for them too. It's not really a good sight and not funny when a guy goes all out on a women during a physical game, and he may be worried himself about the backlash that may result from it from the general public. So, she just let the oppas battle it in between them and step back without making it too obvious (ex: in the grap a chair game a couple of episodes back, you can see her not contesting from the start, eliminated 1st and used her time just dancing to the songs being played).\n\nEven LKS, when he is in a winning mood can contest against anyone, and you can also see KJK being flustered by it multiple times. It's not about who is too strong, cause KJK is obviously number 1, but if he over use his strength he may injure himself or LKS, and that he obviously does not want. Yet, he have an image of being the strongest to protect at the time, and finds himself in a dilemma. \n\nThere are just soo many hidden dynamics and unspoken rules, to make the shooting go smoothly and without incidents, cause they care for each other. Somin's way of helping, is by always taking the initiative, interacting and creating situations where other may join in and not just her (ex: she started the loveline with Sechan to help him out, cause he was falling behind at the time, or lovelines with guests to get them screetime cause they can find the timing to step in or not used to variety shows...). She delivers regular amounts of footage for the pds to edit and choose from. That reduce sometimes even the shooting hours and get the cast to rest earlier.\n\nEdit: wording",

It makes me so angry to read those comments because it isn't them praising this beautiful woman; it's them sexualizing her and her body. As a big-breasted woman myself, I am highly aware of all of this. When I was younger and a lot thinner, I still had large boobs and I kid you not I used to judge men I first met by where they looked first when they saw me. A lot of men glance a look before they even meet your eyes. So seeing people leave those comments about SJH makes me uncomfortable.

I think Song Joong Ki was one of the most competitive as he was new to variety shows those times. Anyway, maybe, the competitiveness of the members eventually toned down because of the injuries (and risk of injuries) they have suffered.",

Even their language is inherently misogynistic: treating adult women like children or fragile damsels in distress who need saving and protection and need to be treated with kid gloves, praising their bias for doing the absolute minimum, etc. Not to mention, especially on the recent few episodes, I have been seeing so many legitimately creepy comments on SJH's body. It makes me so angry to read those comments because it isn't them praising this beautiful woman; it's them sexualizing her and her body. As a big-breasted woman myself, I am highly aware of all of this. When I was younger and a lot thinner, I still had large boobs and I kid you not I used to judge men I first met by where they looked first when they saw me. A lot of men glance a look before they even meet your eyes. So seeing people leave those comments about SJH makes me uncomfortable. I don't know if they are her fans or just creeps, but it's immature and rude. Praise her for her beauty and admire it. But don't insult her and other women.",
