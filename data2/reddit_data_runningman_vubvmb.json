Then at the end asks a totally crazy quiz question for real money for a correct answer or a did prize they can randomly pick from a jar.\n\n\nThe format is a satire of JaeSuk's Yoo quiz on the block.\n\nThere are great older episodes.  Not all are subbed in English tho.\n\nNotable guests are Jeon SoMi.  MiNo.  HwaSa.  Jessi.  Joo WooJae.",
