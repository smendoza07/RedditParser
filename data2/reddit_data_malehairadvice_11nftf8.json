You have a couple options in my opinion. 1- give it time and let it grow and then not go to them again (what I tried to do). 2- Go to someone else and let them see what happened and ask them to help salvage it (what I did), she pretty much did a fade in the back so it wasn\u2019t as noticeable and over time it looked normal again. If you\u2019re wanting it fixed now though, I would do a fade or taper like other people are suggesting.",

Go to a barber with a good reputation and just explain the situation and say you want a mens regular (3 on the sides) with a tapered back. \n\nAs a barber it is a pet peeve of mine when I ask \u201chow would you like the back?
