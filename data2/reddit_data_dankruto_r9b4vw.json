Sasuke can go blind and Naruto would only be able to relay on one sage mode. Naruto can counter everything Sasuke has maybe besides Kirin but Kirin is really had to pull off since the weather got to be right. The best strategy for Sasuke and distance and snip but he would not be in the frame of mind for that also he is risking going blind. Sage Naruto is also on a clock but Naruto can negate his time with a well hidden clone. It would be hard for Naruto but he can counter a lot of what Sasuke can do at this point and if he can't he can just wait him out",

Not helping out in an invasion isn\u2019t a decision to save the village in any way whatsoever. Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

But  Itachi would still kill his clan regardless of his anger, cause uchiha's coup meant war for Land of Fire and Itachi was doing it cause he wanted to prevent that for any cost, with even author calling him \"pacifist\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>why did he feel the need to take Shisui\u2019s eyes away even though he didn\u2019t know about his plan to use it on Fugaku?\n\nThis dude has a sharingan ability that can easily be used on Konoha to control it's victims. If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village). Well, at least most people wouldn't.\n\nHell, Konoha knew kyubi was controled by sharigan, Shisui and Fugaku would be first people suspected of that given how powerfull their eyes were.",

He sat on his ass while the village was destroyed and hundreds or thousands were killed above. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe caused the Uchiha massacre by constantly antagonizing both sides. Then ordered Itachi to carry it out, greatly demeaning the strength of the village. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroke the third's law and leaked that Naruto was the 9tails so he would be the scapegoat for the village, so he and the other 2 old assholes wouldn't be blamed. Nearly turned Naruto into a monster to escape getting blamed. Let me state that again. He threw a 3-5 kid under the bus so he wouldn't get any blame. Speaking of monsters, Danzo was the reason Pain was created. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe let Orochimaru conduct inhumane experiments on the villagers because Orochimaru was benefiting Danzo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanzo was a POS, a deluded POS that thought he was protecting the village when he caused it far more harm than everyone else combined. Had he a single atom in his body that cared for anyone else besides Danzo, he could have activated the seal earlier when he had Sasuke to ensure he took one threat down. instead he kept trying to survive through the ordeal and didn't care about the village. Should also be mentioned that this fight happened right after he fucked the village's relationship with all the other villages because he tried and failed to control the other leaders and got caught then ran away when they got attacked.",

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

When Danzo activated it, he couldn't move so Sasuke and Tobi moved away easy enough. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of it in the same way as the 3rd vs the previous hokages and Orochimaru. Hiruzen knew he couldn't win, so he activated the RDS and went after them. In Danzo's situation, he would have escaped, threw his subordinates at Orochimaru to buy time, then after getting stabbed and as he is about to die he activates the RDS, which Orochimaru easily avoids. That's what happened here. Danzo ran away from the kage meeting and left them to fight his fight while he escaped, then threw his subordinates at Tobi, and only when he was dying he activated a suicide move thinking that he did the same thing as Hiruzen.",

He seemed hesitant/scared, probably due to the war affecting him and was jealous that Hiruzen wasn\u2019t afraid. I mean I can\u2019t fault him for feeling that. I think he could have made for an awesome dark-good guy but ultimately his arrogance and the darkness of his line of duty got to him and fed into his lust for power, etc. Hence the Danzo we saw in the show. \n\nI do find it honorable in a way, that despite his bitterness to Hiruzen, he still respected him deep down, as well as the sacrifice he made for the Leaf during Orochimaru\u2019s attack, and that Danzo wanted to do the same for the Leaf. This was when Sasuke was hellbent on destroying the Leaf after all. I\u2019m not a Danzo lover though. He was still an evil man and did terrible things but I still feel sympathy for him. I mean, he had a fucked up existence. It would be cool if we saw more into Hiruzen and Danzo\u2019s past like that scene.",

Not to forget Shisui said he wanted and was capable to put his clan under genjutsu to avoid clashes. Maybe you're talking about the Danzo who had dark relations like with Hanzo and Orochimaru while knowing all their crimes against Konoha. \n\nThis guy straight up did every action for his ego, all he wanted was the hokage seat, it's blatantly shown in the scenes where he stares at that seat with so much envy. His power trip was the only reason he was anbu chief, not that he was sacrificing himself to do the dark job but that it was the most powerful position he could get after hokage, the he was doing whatever he wants with his exclusive units and could sabotage Hiruzen's governance as much as he wanted.",

This bit is where he's finally finding his courage and trying to pull a heroic sacrifice. Against a villain he created because of his fears, because *of course* he did that.

He stopped the Kotoamatsukami because he believed it to be a temporary fix to the problem they possessed, as they wanted to overthrow the leaf, he then took their eyes cause he believes strength aids security, which is true. He did bad things, but only for the village. It was explaining why he was the way he was, and it made sense. I didn't feel bad for him, but Danzo wasn't as horrible as everyone thinks he was.",

The best strategy for Sasuke and distance and snip but he would not be in the frame of mind for that also he is risking going blind.

Not helping out in an invasion isn\u2019t a decision to save the village in any way whatsoever. Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

But he would have firmly secured the support of the entire population of the village + most of the regular combatants would have still been dead/injured from Pain\u2019s attack (at least in his own assumption, since who could possibly know that Pain could just resurrect a whole village?). \n\nIf Danzo\u2019s plan was becoming Hokage, then this was literally the **perfect** opportunity for a coup.",

Only you got to live because of the deal I made with your 14 year old big bro who I manipulated with his love for you and was super fucked up by having to kill your family to save you. Oh and check out this rad eyeball arm I had made from your family's desecrated corpses. Pretty sweet huh?\n\nSasuke: I'll fucking kill you and your stupid village you bastard!\n\nDanzo: \\*surprised Pikachu face\\*\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that Orochimaru is one of Danzo's former agents. And Danzo continued to work closely with him after he was chased out of the village for his horror experiments on children. I'm not entirely convinced that Danzo was ignorant of Orochimaru's Crush The Leaf plan that resulted in Hiruzen's death. If he thought Hiruzen might be killed he'd gladly stand aside and let it happen so he could be Hokage instead, the same way he did with Tsunade and Pain.",

He sat on his ass while the village was destroyed and hundreds or thousands were killed above. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe caused the Uchiha massacre by constantly antagonizing both sides. Then ordered Itachi to carry it out, greatly demeaning the strength of the village. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroke the third's law and leaked that Naruto was the 9tails so he would be the scapegoat for the village, so he and the other 2 old assholes wouldn't be blamed. Nearly turned Naruto into a monster to escape getting blamed. Let me state that again. He threw a 3-5 kid under the bus so he wouldn't get any blame. Speaking of monsters, Danzo was the reason Pain was created. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe let Orochimaru conduct inhumane experiments on the villagers because Orochimaru was benefiting Danzo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanzo was a POS, a deluded POS that thought he was protecting the village when he caused it far more harm than everyone else combined. Had he a single atom in his body that cared for anyone else besides Danzo, he could have activated the seal earlier when he had Sasuke to ensure he took one threat down. instead he kept trying to survive through the ordeal and didn't care about the village. Should also be mentioned that this fight happened right after he fucked the village's relationship with all the other villages because he tried and failed to control the other leaders and got caught then ran away when they got attacked.",

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

When Danzo activated it, he couldn't move so Sasuke and Tobi moved away easy enough. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of it in the same way as the 3rd vs the previous hokages and Orochimaru. Hiruzen knew he couldn't win, so he activated the RDS and went after them. In Danzo's situation, he would have escaped, threw his subordinates at Orochimaru to buy time, then after getting stabbed and as he is about to die he activates the RDS, which Orochimaru easily avoids. That's what happened here. Danzo ran away from the kage meeting and left them to fight his fight while he escaped, then threw his subordinates at Tobi, and only when he was dying he activated a suicide move thinking that he did the same thing as Hiruzen.",

I think he could have made for an awesome dark-good guy but ultimately his arrogance and the darkness of his line of duty got to him and fed into his lust for power, etc. Hence the Danzo we saw in the show. \n\nI do find it honorable in a way, that despite his bitterness to Hiruzen, he still respected him deep down, as well as the sacrifice he made for the Leaf during Orochimaru\u2019s attack, and that Danzo wanted to do the same for the Leaf. This was when Sasuke was hellbent on destroying the Leaf after all. I\u2019m not a Danzo lover though. He was still an evil man and did terrible things but I still feel sympathy for him. I mean, he had a fucked up existence. It would be cool if we saw more into Hiruzen and Danzo\u2019s past like that scene.",

Not helping out in an invasion isn\u2019t a decision to save the village in any way whatsoever. Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

Only you got to live because of the deal I made with your 14 year old big bro who I manipulated with his love for you and was super fucked up by having to kill your family to save you. Oh and check out this rad eyeball arm I had made from your family's desecrated corpses. Pretty sweet huh?\n\nSasuke: I'll fucking kill you and your stupid village you bastard!\n\nDanzo: \\*surprised Pikachu face\\*\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that Orochimaru is one of Danzo's former agents. And Danzo continued to work closely with him after he was chased out of the village for his horror experiments on children. I'm not entirely convinced that Danzo was ignorant of Orochimaru's Crush The Leaf plan that resulted in Hiruzen's death. If he thought Hiruzen might be killed he'd gladly stand aside and let it happen so he could be Hokage instead, the same way he did with Tsunade and Pain.",

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

Sasuke can go blind and Naruto would only be able to relay on one sage mode. Naruto can counter everything Sasuke has maybe besides Kirin but Kirin is really had to pull off since the weather got to be right. The best strategy for Sasuke and distance and snip but he would not be in the frame of mind for that also he is risking going blind. Sage Naruto is also on a clock but Naruto can negate his time with a well hidden clone. It would be hard for Naruto but he can counter a lot of what Sasuke can do at this point and if he can't he can just wait him out",

Not helping out in an invasion isn\u2019t a decision to save the village in any way whatsoever. Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

So we know he doesn't give a shit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Where did you get that?\n\nLogic.\n\n\n\n\n>If your top men do not want you around then dictator may cut them off from power and then he will stay around\n\nCan you tell me a single Jonin who has been randomly cut off??\nAnd with whom he'd replace them with??\nIt's the things with closed systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Jonin vote would strengthen his position but it's nowhere stated that he would lose it without it. \n\n\nIt's literally stated.\nIn fact Danzo goes out of his way to get the Jonin to approve him by any means necessary.\nAfter the shit show of the summit.\nAy and Onoki state that the Jonin would obviously depose Danzo after they heard what he had pulled.\nYamato and Kakashi tell Gaara as much, Yamato going as far as saying that given that the Jonin would ofc vote for Kakashi, he should be acting Kage right away.",

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

Not helping out in an invasion isn\u2019t a decision to save the village in any way whatsoever. Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

She was wasting her strength on saving people rather then face danger direct (or saving her strength  to support Naruto when he will come back).\n\nSure Naruto would have support if he came sooner, but who is to say they would still win then? When Tsunade spent most her energy on saving people. Kakashi was close in his fight. But even then, it took few sage modes and Kyubi to beat already **weakened** Pain.\n\nEdit: Naruto himself said, anyone other jumping in fight would just get in a way, right before his fight with Pain.

Not Konoha and uchihas.

If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village).

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

The best strategy for Sasuke and distance and snip but he would not be in the frame of mind for that also he is risking going blind.

Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

But even then, it took few sage modes and Kyubi to beat already **weakened** Pain.\n\nEdit: Naruto himself said, anyone other jumping in fight would just get in a way, right before his fight with Pain.

If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village).

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

Pain was killing them and Danzo wasn't able to prevented that. In war they make decision that would cost lives for thing they were convinced that was more important.   \nIn Kakashi's novel we are told durring/after war, food/medicines and so for was mostly reserved for ninja at the expense of dying civilians.

If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village).

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

Shinobi don\u2019t care about the outcome of a problem, just that they have a job to confront the problem and endure it. Can\u2019t argue with this fact, period. This move was solely political to drag Tsunade out of office and take control of a broken village, not to stand back and regroup. Idk about all this narrative shit, but I will say this. Danzo is just making an excuse when he says he\u2019s doing things for the village. It\u2019s his delusional reasoning for all the destruction he caused. Danzo\u2019s no stratgist nor a shinobi. He either dumps a nonexistent problem for someone else to deal with or blindly destroys an unrelated cause \u201cfor the sake of the village\u201d. That delusion came full circle at the end of his life when he tried ending Sasuke and Tobi\u2019s lives with some curse mark jutsu. My guy didn\u2019t save the village by doing that. He avoided the problem by just trying to cause more destruction. Danzo will always and forever be just a delusional coward with a destructive personality. He didn\u2019t avoid Pain bc he saw no point. He deliberately caused more destruction to gain power, not some regrouping shit.",

She was wasting her strength on saving people rather then face danger direct (or saving her strength  to support Naruto when he will come back).\n\nSure Naruto would have support if he came sooner, but who is to say they would still win then? When Tsunade spent most her energy on saving people. Kakashi was close in his fight. But even then, it took few sage modes and Kyubi to beat already **weakened** Pain.\n\nEdit: Naruto himself said, anyone other jumping in fight would just get in a way, right before his fight with Pain.

Not Konoha and uchihas. But  Itachi would still kill his clan regardless of his anger, cause uchiha's coup meant war for Land of Fire and Itachi was doing it cause he wanted to prevent that for any cost, with even author calling him \"pacifist\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>why did he feel the need to take Shisui\u2019s eyes away even though he didn\u2019t know about his plan to use it on Fugaku?\n\nThis dude has a sharingan ability that can easily be used on Konoha to control it's victims. If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village). Well, at least most people wouldn't.\n\nHell, Konoha knew kyubi was controled by sharigan, Shisui and Fugaku would be first people suspected of that given how powerfull their eyes were.",

                            "body": "When it comes to Kakashi & Obito, I'd say it's a bit of both. Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

Her whole plan was banking everything on Naruto and his training. She was wasting her strength on saving people rather then face danger direct (or saving her strength  to support Naruto when he will come back).\n\nSure Naruto would have support if he came sooner, but who is to say they would still win then? When Tsunade spent most her energy on saving people. Kakashi was close in his fight. But even then, it took few sage modes and Kyubi to beat already **weakened** Pain.\n\nEdit: Naruto himself said, anyone other jumping in fight would just get in a way, right before his fight with Pain.

If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village). Well, at least most people wouldn't.\n\nHell, Konoha knew kyubi was controled by sharigan, Shisui and Fugaku would be first people suspected of that given how powerfull their eyes were.",

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

So I wouldn't be so sure of how safe from harm civilians were.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No, they could be saved. \r  \n\r\n\nWhich could cost him geting arrested by Tsuande after the attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**If the candidate is not approved he's not Hokage plain and simple**, it's obvious why, Hokage is a glorified dictator, if your top men do not want you around, you'll not be around.\n\nWhere did you get that? If your top men do not want you around then dictator may cut them off from power and then he will stay around. Jonin vote would strengthen his position but it's nowhere stated that he would lose it without it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How's not much? \n\nCause it's just his words. As in, they don't have solid proves.

Her whole plan was banking everything on Naruto and his training. She was wasting her strength on saving people rather then face danger direct (or saving her strength  to support Naruto when he will come back).\n\nSure Naruto would have support if he came sooner, but who is to say they would still win then? When Tsunade spent most her energy on saving people. Kakashi was close in his fight. But even then, it took few sage modes and Kyubi to beat already **weakened** Pain.\n\nEdit: Naruto himself said, anyone other jumping in fight would just get in a way, right before his fight with Pain.

If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village).

Obito cannot transport targets larger than a Kunai from a distance / use a portal anywhere outside of his own body bigger than a knife, so that's definitely an ability that the left eye is **more proficient** at. \n\nWe've seen Obito transporting Kaguya's rod from a short distance without having to touch it, but he's said multiple times that he needs to be touching people to transport them, whereas Kakashi can use it on any target from a distance, but maybe he'd also have access to Obito's abilities, in less proficiency (since one eye is better at one thing than the other) if his body was compatible with the eye.\n\n**As for Sasuke:** That's not quite right. Basically, Mangekyou users typically have either 2 special abilities, each used by a different eye. Both eyes combined can make a Susanoo if the user is powerful enough. \n\nItachi had Amaterasu in one eye, and Tsukuyomi on the other. Sasuke on the other hand, had Amaterasu in one eye, and **Kagutsuchi** in the other, you might remember them actually animating this, he creates the flames with one eye (camera zooms on one eye while the other is closed), then switches to the other eye to control/shape shift those flames.\n\nSo in his left eye, Sasuke had his Mangekyou's Kagutsuchi/Flame control, AND his Rinnegan and it's unique ability.\n\nMadara could also use his Mangekyo's ability, one of which we know to be some sort of time rewind [like he used here](https://youtu.be/SePjB319jQA?t=78) (video game), along with his Rinnegan's unique ability, which was Limbo.\n\nI like how they clarified the usefulness of Madara's rewind in that scene too, he knew something was coming but had no idea when and where due to being blinded by the smoke, so he activated it to be able to rewind after seeing where the attack would come from. I guess you could say it's sort of like a smaller version of Izanagi.",

Organizing her ninjas and herself in team to beat one Pain's bodies separately?\n\nNo, she was fighting with symptoms of attack, not the cause of attack. Her whole plan was banking everything on Naruto and his training. She was wasting her strength on saving people rather then face danger direct (or saving her strength  to support Naruto when he will come back).\n\nSure Naruto would have support if he came sooner, but who is to say they would still win then? When Tsunade spent most her energy on saving people. Kakashi was close in his fight. But even then, it took few sage modes and Kyubi to beat already **weakened** Pain.\n\nEdit: Naruto himself said, anyone other jumping in fight would just get in a way, right before his fight with Pain. For him, this fight was personal because of Jiraiya's death.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As for the Uchiha, even though they didn\u2019t think the leaf were involved with Itachi killing Shisui, it still escalated the situation due to Itachi being so mad at that time...\n\nIt escalated tensions between Itachi and his clan. Not Konoha and uchihas. But  Itachi would still kill his clan regardless of his anger, cause uchiha's coup meant war for Land of Fire and Itachi was doing it cause he wanted to prevent that for any cost, with even author calling him \"pacifist\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>why did he feel the need to take Shisui\u2019s eyes away even though he didn\u2019t know about his plan to use it on Fugaku?\n\nThis dude has a sharingan ability that can easily be used on Konoha to control it's victims. If you were a leader of a village and someone within your village had an ability that can easily take over your village, I don't think you're just going to do nothing and play with your fingers (especially considering that guy is from clan that has growing resentment toward your village). Well, at least most people wouldn't.\n\nHell, Konoha knew kyubi was controled by sharigan, Shisui and Fugaku would be first people suspected of that given how powerfull their eyes were.",

Danzo chose not to because it suited him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>We don't know how much power Jonin council had over candidates.\n\nWe actually do know.\nThe Fire Lord proposes a candidate and the Jonin Council approves them.\n\nIf the candidate is not approved he's not Hokage plain and simple, it's obvious why, Hokage is a glorified dictator, if your top men do not want you around, you'll not be around.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo was doing all Kage duties when he was elected.\n\nBecause Tsunade was in coma and they needed a leader asap.\nDando himself acknowledged that his position was thin without the support of the Jonin, which is why he tried to genjutsu his way to the position of leader of the coalition, the Jonin would have no choice but to back him if all the other Kage recognized him as Hokage.\nThis is straight out of Danzo's own mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>If you are a new king and your knights don't approve you, that doesn't change the fact you rule over them.\n\n??? He's not a King.\nHe's a candidate for a King, acting as King for a time because there's no one better to do so.\n\n\n\n>Again, that's not much.\n\nHow's not much?\nThey knew he was a member of an allegedly dissolved organization. So either they were fine with straight up traitors running among them or they were not so dissolved.",
