    "body": "I\u2019ve been seeing a SD for the last 6 weeks. We usually don\u2019t use condoms because we did agree on being exclusive and we were both tested beforehand. I was fine with that. \n\nWell, last week I got sick and was put on antibiotics.  My doctor warned me that the antibiotics I have been taking could potentially cause my birth control to be ineffective. \n\nI was supposed to meet up with my SD lastnight and simply sent him a text saying \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to wear a condom because of the antibiotics I\u2019m currently taking.\u201d \n\nHe replied with, \u201care you sure we can\u2019t just go without and I\u2019ll buy plan b? It\u2019s really not worth being intimate if I have to wear a condom because it doesn\u2019t feel as good.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t answer him right away and he texted me again saying, \u201clet\u2019s just skip it and meet up when you\u2019re normal again.\u201d \n\nHe then proceeded to send me messages saying that he was so bummed that he couldn\u2019t see me. \n\nThe entire interaction just rubbed me the wrong way. I do honestly feel upset and very turned off by this. \n\nWould this bother you? Do you feel like it is acceptable?",

One thing led to another and it went to sex. I asked him to wear a condom because 1. I just completed my antibiotics and knew my birth control was going to be whack and 2. Safe sex with a tinder hook up. He understood completely. \n\nPlan B is a 'opps the condom broke', 'I accidentally missed a dose of my birth control' and 'we may have fucked too close to ovulation and i just want to make sure'. It isn't something you plan in advance, therefore, Plan B. \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou had me ranting, I hope you are well and always put yourself first boo.",

Before my job forced me to move we were planning a trip to Paris together (to be fair she had already said that trip was gonna be free for me, which makes sense given how much it was gonna cost). \n\nBut ya know what happened when she got her period? Unless we had something else planned, we skipped that visit. Know why? This isn't a real life relationship. This is a relationship based on the idea that I pay her for her time and companionship, and if that companionship was unavailable for whatever reason, I was not just going to pay for her time. There's actually a couple times during her period she just came over to hang out, because we had become friends and enjoyed some activities outside the bedroom with.

Meets get canceled for all sorts of things. In this case the sugar daddy didn't want the meet, so it got cancelled. The issue here for me isn't that he cancelled, it's his wording of it.

Hopefully a friendship forms yes, but the underlying part of a SR is I give you $xxxx amount of money a month, you visit me x amount of times, or I pay you $xxx amount of money a visit and we schedule x amount of visits a month. And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time. Anything more romantic or emotionally involved than that is not part of the SR relationship, and is just two people getting to know each other and become friends.",

What if your beau doesn't enjoy sex with condoms, full stop?  Should he have sucked it up and had unenjoyable sex with you?  If so, why?\n\nIn general, people should be able to set the parameters of the sex they have.  If a person doesn't want to use condoms, we shouldn't get mad at them when they decline to use condoms.

Leaving aside the issues of whether the medication might require you to use a condom for STI protection (I'm not sure what you're taking and why), it seems pretty weird his alternative is to finish inside you instead of not finishing inside you.\n\nYes, I am well aware that \"pulling out\" isn't perfect, but I have been able to do so successful for decades and when there is the least bit of doubt, pull it out early.\n\nThis guy isn't respecting you enough.",

SR transactions are disguised with unspoken rule after the initial agreement. One can consider the initial M&G as purely transactional. Just like a long-term escorting transaction can in itself contain an emotional aspect. Intimacy + Time = Emotional Feelings. Clearly this is generalized and does not hold true at the individual level. Expectation of both parties is always a factor but expectations change. Nothing remains unchanged with time. The question here is the expectation of the SD vs. SB. One interpretation of the SBs post regarding the SD can be of a transactional nature or not. Only they would know but generalizing SR is more transactional vs non SR which is more compromise. A couple can still be in a SR without such labels. It\u2019s really the dynamics of the relationship which defines a relationship as such.",

A lot of things that all of us dress up in our head as being really bad seemed a lot more understandable when you communicate with someone.\n\nMy real issue if I was him would be the changing of the circumstances so quickly into things. IME every single time you give in a rules change early without heavy push back, in or out of the bowl, people treat it like a sign that you are weak and they'd be dumb NOT to exploit you. Honestly it sounds like he's of the same background and was trying to find a middle ground between showing you can't just walk all over him and ending the entire Arrangement permanently because he likes you. And I get that things happen and you didn't do anything wrong and it's a completely reasonable thing to ask. But to him it could sound like who knows what because of the text message and there's no tone voice. Delicate issues like this are usually handled better with at least a phone call.",

What I personally have learned (and it sounds like maybe he has as well) is that it does not matter the situation, if you don't push back heavily on changes to informal agreements early in a relationship it leads to things changing dramatically past what you're comfortable with. \n\nAnd again I'm not saying it's fair.

Before my job forced me to move we were planning a trip to Paris together (to be fair she had already said that trip was gonna be free for me, which makes sense given how much it was gonna cost). \n\nBut ya know what happened when she got her period? Unless we had something else planned, we skipped that visit. Know why? This isn't a real life relationship. This is a relationship based on the idea that I pay her for her time and companionship, and if that companionship was unavailable for whatever reason, I was not just going to pay for her time. There's actually a couple times during her period she just came over to hang out, because we had become friends and enjoyed some activities outside the bedroom with. At that point, it had a part of a real relationship (friendship) involved.",

He decided he didn't want to have a visit because he wasn't getting what he wanted out of it, and pretty much said 'lets meet up next time when you feel better\" IE when you are off antibiotics. \n\nThis happens all the time in sugar relationships. Meets get canceled for all sorts of things. In this case the sugar daddy didn't want the meet, so it got cancelled. The issue here for me isn't that he cancelled, it's his wording of it. It comes off as crass at best. He could have worded the whole thing a LOT better.",

It's about a man enjoying a womans time, and paying for it. It's about a woman needing money, and being happy (or at least ok with) spending time with a (older) man, keeping him company, and having sex with him. Hopefully a friendship forms yes, but the underlying part of a SR is I give you $xxxx amount of money a month, you visit me x amount of times, or I pay you $xxx amount of money a visit and we schedule x amount of visits a month. And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time. Anything more romantic or emotionally involved than that is not part of the SR relationship, and is just two people getting to know each other and become friends.",

SR transactions are disguised with unspoken rule after the initial agreement. One can consider the initial M&G as purely transactional. Just like a long-term escorting transaction can in itself contain an emotional aspect. Intimacy + Time = Emotional Feelings. Clearly this is generalized and does not hold true at the individual level. Expectation of both parties is always a factor but expectations change. Nothing remains unchanged with time. The question here is the expectation of the SD vs. SB. One interpretation of the SBs post regarding the SD can be of a transactional nature or not. Only they would know but generalizing SR is more transactional vs non SR which is more compromise. A couple can still be in a SR without such labels. It\u2019s really the dynamics of the relationship which defines a relationship as such.",

Unless we had something else planned, we skipped that visit. Know why? This isn't a real life relationship. This is a relationship based on the idea that I pay her for her time and companionship, and if that companionship was unavailable for whatever reason, I was not just going to pay for her time. There's actually a couple times during her period she just came over to hang out, because we had become friends and enjoyed some activities outside the bedroom with.

Hopefully a friendship forms yes, but the underlying part of a SR is I give you $xxxx amount of money a month, you visit me x amount of times, or I pay you $xxx amount of money a visit and we schedule x amount of visits a month. And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time. Anything more romantic or emotionally involved than that is not part of the SR relationship, and is just two people getting to know each other and become friends.",

SR transactions are disguised with unspoken rule after the initial agreement. One can consider the initial M&G as purely transactional. Just like a long-term escorting transaction can in itself contain an emotional aspect. Intimacy + Time = Emotional Feelings. Clearly this is generalized and does not hold true at the individual level. Expectation of both parties is always a factor but expectations change. Nothing remains unchanged with time. The question here is the expectation of the SD vs. SB. One interpretation of the SBs post regarding the SD can be of a transactional nature or not. Only they would know but generalizing SR is more transactional vs non SR which is more compromise. A couple can still be in a SR without such labels. It\u2019s really the dynamics of the relationship which defines a relationship as such.",

Before my job forced me to move we were planning a trip to Paris together (to be fair she had already said that trip was gonna be free for me, which makes sense given how much it was gonna cost). \n\nBut ya know what happened when she got her period? Unless we had something else planned, we skipped that visit. Know why? This isn't a real life relationship. This is a relationship based on the idea that I pay her for her time and companionship, and if that companionship was unavailable for whatever reason, I was not just going to pay for her time. There's actually a couple times during her period she just came over to hang out, because we had become friends and enjoyed some activities outside the bedroom with. At that point, it had a part of a real relationship (friendship) involved.",

Meets get canceled for all sorts of things. In this case the sugar daddy didn't want the meet, so it got cancelled. The issue here for me isn't that he cancelled, it's his wording of it.

And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time.

SR transactions are disguised with unspoken rule after the initial agreement. One can consider the initial M&G as purely transactional. Just like a long-term escorting transaction can in itself contain an emotional aspect. Intimacy + Time = Emotional Feelings. Clearly this is generalized and does not hold true at the individual level. Expectation of both parties is always a factor but expectations change. Nothing remains unchanged with time. The question here is the expectation of the SD vs. SB. One interpretation of the SBs post regarding the SD can be of a transactional nature or not. Only they would know but generalizing SR is more transactional vs non SR which is more compromise. A couple can still be in a SR without such labels. It\u2019s really the dynamics of the relationship which defines a relationship as such.",

This is a relationship based on the idea that I pay her for her time and companionship, and if that companionship was unavailable for whatever reason, I was not just going to pay for her time. There's actually a couple times during her period she just came over to hang out, because we had become friends and enjoyed some activities outside the bedroom with. At that point, it had a part of a real relationship (friendship) involved.",

It's not about her health and if she feels like she's up to visiting, it's his decision if he wants to have that visit as much as it is hers. He decided he didn't want to have a visit because he wasn't getting what he wanted out of it, and pretty much said 'lets meet up next time when you feel better\" IE when you are off antibiotics. \n\nThis happens all the time in sugar relationships. Meets get canceled for all sorts of things. In this case the sugar daddy didn't want the meet, so it got cancelled. The issue here for me isn't that he cancelled, it's his wording of it. It comes off as crass at best. He could have worded the whole thing a LOT better.",

It's about a man enjoying a womans time, and paying for it. It's about a woman needing money, and being happy (or at least ok with) spending time with a (older) man, keeping him company, and having sex with him. Hopefully a friendship forms yes, but the underlying part of a SR is I give you $xxxx amount of money a month, you visit me x amount of times, or I pay you $xxx amount of money a visit and we schedule x amount of visits a month. And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time. Anything more romantic or emotionally involved than that is not part of the SR relationship, and is just two people getting to know each other and become friends.",

SR transactions are disguised with unspoken rule after the initial agreement. One can consider the initial M&G as purely transactional. Just like a long-term escorting transaction can in itself contain an emotional aspect. Intimacy + Time = Emotional Feelings. Clearly this is generalized and does not hold true at the individual level. Expectation of both parties is always a factor but expectations change. Nothing remains unchanged with time. The question here is the expectation of the SD vs. SB. One interpretation of the SBs post regarding the SD can be of a transactional nature or not. Only they would know but generalizing SR is more transactional vs non SR which is more compromise. A couple can still be in a SR without such labels. It\u2019s really the dynamics of the relationship which defines a relationship as such.",

Hopefully a friendship forms yes, but the underlying part of a SR is I give you $xxxx amount of money a month, you visit me x amount of times, or I pay you $xxx amount of money a visit and we schedule x amount of visits a month. And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time.

Hopefully a friendship forms yes, but the underlying part of a SR is I give you $xxxx amount of money a month, you visit me x amount of times, or I pay you $xxx amount of money a visit and we schedule x amount of visits a month. And yes, that comes down to I'm spending money for a womans time because they are beautiful and I want to have sex with them during that time. Anything more romantic or emotionally involved than that is not part of the SR relationship, and is just two people getting to know each other and become friends.",
