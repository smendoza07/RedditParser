But I\u2019m glad actually that in the end, in his moment of death, he came to the realisation that he figured he was wrong in what he was doing and the dark path was probably not the right one. I also felt a tad emotional in when he was remembering his time with hiruzen in their younger days and that if hiruzen really thought of him as his friend and if he himself felt the same. We can all say Danzo is a terrible person due to a lot of his decisions being extremely messed up and leading to some of the misgivings that happened later, but everything he did was for the leaf and that\u2019s all he thought about, it was his old age mentality and unwillingness to adapt to change that led him astray and ultimately to his downfall and in the end he is seen as the lowest of the low",
