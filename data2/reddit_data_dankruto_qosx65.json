It doesn't matter how hard you punch if you're going to get your face broken in by one punch anyways. People say Kishimoto can't write females, but he writes females better than any other manga. Hunter x Hunter Bisky is just a man basically. Even in Bleach, Rukia keeps trying to act like a man and getting hurt or kidnapped forcing everyone to save her ass. Kishimoto, knowing that women are weaker in body and mind, gave his characters positions where they knew they wouldn't fuck things up for other people. Sakura is one of, probably the best, female characters in all of fiction.",

He literally chose not to use Sakura's awesome talents and have her pine over a huge asshole for no reason. Konan, Temari, Tayuya, Karui, Mei, Ino already all strong women. He did a bad job of letting characters shine when they weren't Naruto or Sasuke. This extends to other male characters too.\n\nEdit: I feel like a lot of writers act like women are aliens or something when we aren't. We can have the same motivations and flaws as men. Also fucking hate the idea that \"oh she's the one girl in the trio, she has to be in love with one of them.\" Nah bitch. Women and men can be friends. My favorite women that have been out recently have been in JJK. JoJo's also has great women. It's not impossible to be a shounen and still do your female characters justice.",

It's a very real situation that a lot of young women are suddenly thrust into and she's a great rolemodel for it, although it would have meant more if it had been done before the end of the series. Even TenTen, being the argably weakest character of her gen, takes the So6Ps ninja tools becoming godly in power, refuses to elaborate, and doesn't feel pressured to marry because she knows there aren't any men worth her in the village.  \n\n\nAlso, there aren't any women in JoJo.

I talk about how Sakura, one of the three main leads is one of the best female characters in all of fiction, and everybody gets pissy and downvotes the comment because she's a woman. Quite honestly, I'm appalled at the nature of the Naruto fanbase. I thought we were better than this, but apparently not. What would your grandmothers think?",

I often think about how cool it would be if sakura grew up to be the person who had the most soul searching around her own actions and the situation as a whole. Realizing she couldn\u2019t really relate to sasuke or Naruto, but still eanting to be there for them and standing with them teough their pain. Putting her love for sasuke behind as a teenage crush and wanting back her teammate and friend instead. Being part of putting sasuke in his place when it comes to his plans. Having sakura be the one making him rea\u00f8ize that revenge will get him nowhere and that despite she not having lost her family she can still understand people around her is suffering. Letting Sasuke know that despite his shitty situation that he is not special and certainly not the only one suffering in this shinobi world. Sakura should have been the one to become an adult amongst them.",

Sasuke's KI was so strong that it was accelerating itatchi's illness. That's why we only see Itatchi bleed badly when Sasuke or someone around him has been near Itatchi. Sasuke would have beat him with enough time he just wasn't warmed up enough yet.",

I find it hard to compare Sakura to him when Krillin is a much more proficient fighter for most of the series. Sakura is only really useful during the exams when both Naruto and Sasuke are knocked out, and is probably a more knowledgeable ninja than all of the other leaf 11, but then does literally nothing useful. Sure she has a few moments in part 2 but she also lies to Naruto then tries to kill Sasuke alone because she thinks she can con him with her womanly charms. She does the dumbest shit, and it's probably because the writer wanted to put Sakura with Sasuke at the end of the series... Because nothing says love like multiple attempts at murder.",

When falling after Orochimaru knocked Naruto out, Sakura used a kunai yo stop his fall (Kakashi was worried earlier about Naruto falling out of a tree, so falling is still dangerous at this point).\n\n===\n\nAnyone who says Sakura in part one (manga) is a bad or only decent character doesn't know what they're talking about and need to stop reading so much Fanfiction. Without Sakura, Naruto & Sasuke dies at the very least in the Forest of Death... You may say they could have had a better team mate, but who that isn't already on a team?

You proceed to then say that Krillin is actually the strongest human. I then go on to counter that. The same way you said that Sakura isn\u2019t useful unless Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, I pointed out that Krillin isn\u2019t actually the strongest human unless you remove 17, 18, and Tien from the equation.

They had a really good opportunity with the Tsunade\u2019s relationship in the same way jiraiya and orochimaru had huge effects on their counterparts emotionally. I know there\u2019s a few filler episodes exploring it, but I think they could of done more. \n\nSasuke has a sub plot of killing itachi, and naruto wants to be hokage, what about Sakura? There could of been a cool medical related goal for them to establish for her to keep pushing her boundaries. Maybe there\u2019s an arc where she can\u2019t save someone in time and then strives to keep growing in her skills to never let it happen again etc. \n\nIt just seemed like naruto and sasuke even beyond power levels were getting constant new developments to enhance their character. Sakura started out SO STRONG in my opinion, like a great platform for some cool stuff, but it felt like midway through they kinda stopped, which was a shame. \n\nI don\u2019t think Sakura is useless, she\u2019s not nearly as useful as sasuke or naruto, but most characters aren\u2019t, she had a lot of awesome achievements esrly on and then in the war arc as a medical ninja, but I think considering her status as the second lead, they could of done more. I guess I just find it a shame because I restarted shippuden a few months ago and the beginning she was so awesome, wished they kept building.

Sakura funnels it into her muscles on a level no one else can compare to, and she funneled 3 years worth of it through her body into Obito over like a minute. Sakura essentially did 3 years of training over a few seconds to minutes. For comparison, Naruto in the 2 year gap between Shippudden and The Last went from needing help against Kaguya to one shotting Toneri who was the strongest enemy they had faced up until that point.\n\nSo if 2 years of training for them at that age gets Naruto there, imagine Sakura who was already in base relative to KCM1/2 doing 3 years of it.",

She was supposed to be this genius-level prodigy in theoretics and chakra management, but that is only relevant about three times in 700 chapters. First when she's flexing on Sasuke and Naruto about climbing the tree with chakra, then during the Chuunin exam (and her role is just to be mindcontrolled into giving Ino the answers), and when she's able to learn medical ninjutsu. \n\nThe problem with chakra control is that unless you go out of your way to show that it's difficult, it seems effortless. And it seems that the only way Kishimoto thought of to show that Sakura is good is to have her easily do what someone else is failing at.\n\nImagine a Sakura that can take advantage of her big brain. Pulling off kunai and shuriken throws that seem impossible because she can calculate the angles perfectly. A Sakura who can predict the movements and actions of others, making her into a great tactician. Not the strongest, but the smartest.\n\nIt annoys me that Naruto, Sasuke, and the others, are all powering up throughout the series but Sakura remains at her normal level. She's about as powerful by the timeskip as she was in the Land of Waves, and after the timeskip her power is only really on par during the Save Gaara arc. After that, everyone else outlevels her.\n\nAll of this annoys me, because I like Sakura. I like her backstory. I like that she's the nerd. I like her design. I generally like her character.",

The joke is \"Chuck Norris is a God, no he is above God, he's Chuck Norris!\" the criticism that started said joke was that he was often written to overcome ridiculous odds in ridiculously impossible ways, the show had terrible writing.\n\n  \nSo no, Sakura doesn't suck, her character design is great, her abilities are great, and she is a very strong character in terms of stats, easily kage level, saying Sakura herself sucks is for comedy. The real flaw, which is entirely Kishimoto's fault, was the parts she often took in the actual developments/events in the plot.\n\n  \nOf course, if we're talking about the original Naruto when they were 12, then every single fucking bit we saw of her sucked, and she sucked in terms of stats too, being pretty much the weakest & most featless character in the whole show despite having the potential for way more, apparently having better chakra control than everyone else, which was exhibited **once** when she ***climbed a fucking tree***, and \"having an affinity for genjutsu & fighting genjutsu\" (<- whatever the fuck happened to that), also exhibited once when she dispelled a basic ass genjutsu that Shikamaru and anyone who knew how did too.\n\n  \nSo yeah there's also that, 12 y/o Sakura was a nonredeemable basic useless dingus. Then in Shippuden she became awesome, but then she was written to act like a useless tool in multiple events and dialogues.",

Too bad she didn\u2019t get any moments that made me like her that way again. The fact that at the end she just all of a sudden is supposed to be on the same level as them despite the lack of screen time she has and the plethora of power ups naruto and sasuke got consecutively is kind of dumb. \n\nAll in all, I can see someone liking Sakura, which makes me sad because it is an undeniable fact she is shit on and underused the most despite being one of the main three characters.",

Then I started liking her character a bit in Shippuden but man as soon as the Tenchi bridge arc started, I started hating her. She was literally punching Sai for speaking facts while telling Naruto to control his anger. I mean who the fuck does she think she is? The downword slope continued and it was the Five Kage Summit Arc which made her my least favorite character. I mean she got almost killed twice by her Sasuke-Kun like an idiot. That arc completely screwed her character if it wasnt already screwed. And then she didnt redeemes herself in the War Arc too. I seriously dont understand people who like her but its okay since opinions are subjective. However, I read that your most favorite character is Gaara which is a pretty good choice. He is in my top 5 too. Naruto,Kakashi,Itachi,Nagato and Gaara are my favorites too.",

Not like she can go after Kurama's dick. She also learns to use medical ninjutsu because she knows she's too weak to fight on a battlefield. It doesn't matter how hard you punch if you're going to get your face broken in by one punch anyways. People say Kishimoto can't write females, but he writes females better than any other manga. Hunter x Hunter Bisky is just a man basically. Even in Bleach, Rukia keeps trying to act like a man and getting hurt or kidnapped forcing everyone to save her ass. Kishimoto, knowing that women are weaker in body and mind, gave his characters positions where they knew they wouldn't fuck things up for other people. Sakura is one of, probably the best, female characters in all of fiction.",

He did a bad job of letting characters shine when they weren't Naruto or Sasuke. This extends to other male characters too.\n\nEdit: I feel like a lot of writers act like women are aliens or something when we aren't. We can have the same motivations and flaws as men. Also fucking hate the idea that \"oh she's the one girl in the trio, she has to be in love with one of them.\" Nah bitch. Women and men can be friends. My favorite women that have been out recently have been in JJK. JoJo's also has great women. It's not impossible to be a shounen and still do your female characters justice.",

Putting her love for sasuke behind as a teenage crush and wanting back her teammate and friend instead. Being part of putting sasuke in his place when it comes to his plans. Having sakura be the one making him rea\u00f8ize that revenge will get him nowhere and that despite she not having lost her family she can still understand people around her is suffering. Letting Sasuke know that despite his shitty situation that he is not special and certainly not the only one suffering in this shinobi world.

Sasuke's KI was so strong that it was accelerating itatchi's illness. That's why we only see Itatchi bleed badly when Sasuke or someone around him has been near Itatchi.

Sure she has a few moments in part 2 but she also lies to Naruto then tries to kill Sasuke alone because she thinks she can con him with her womanly charms. She does the dumbest shit, and it's probably because the writer wanted to put Sakura with Sasuke at the end of the series... Because nothing says love like multiple attempts at murder.",

They had a really good opportunity with the Tsunade\u2019s relationship in the same way jiraiya and orochimaru had huge effects on their counterparts emotionally. I know there\u2019s a few filler episodes exploring it, but I think they could of done more. \n\nSasuke has a sub plot of killing itachi, and naruto wants to be hokage, what about Sakura? There could of been a cool medical related goal for them to establish for her to keep pushing her boundaries. Maybe there\u2019s an arc where she can\u2019t save someone in time and then strives to keep growing in her skills to never let it happen again etc. \n\nIt just seemed like naruto and sasuke even beyond power levels were getting constant new developments to enhance their character. Sakura started out SO STRONG in my opinion, like a great platform for some cool stuff, but it felt like midway through they kinda stopped, which was a shame. \n\nI don\u2019t think Sakura is useless, she\u2019s not nearly as useful as sasuke or naruto, but most characters aren\u2019t, she had a lot of awesome achievements esrly on and then in the war arc as a medical ninja, but I think considering her status as the second lead, they could of done more. I guess I just find it a shame because I restarted shippuden a few months ago and the beginning she was so awesome, wished they kept building.

Sakura funnels it into her muscles on a level no one else can compare to, and she funneled 3 years worth of it through her body into Obito over like a minute. Sakura essentially did 3 years of training over a few seconds to minutes. For comparison, Naruto in the 2 year gap between Shippudden and The Last went from needing help against Kaguya to one shotting Toneri who was the strongest enemy they had faced up until that point.\n\nSo if 2 years of training for them at that age gets Naruto there, imagine Sakura who was already in base relative to KCM1/2 doing 3 years of it.",

She even blatantly said she had watched him for years, even if he didn\u2019t know her all that well she still went out of her way to watch him. But weird. Then again, they were all weird in the original series.",

Also Hinata said she has been watching him but it doesn't mean stalking, it means keeping an eye on and looking out for him. Plus Naruto has no problem with that and he already thanked her for staying by his side like that from the start.",

He did a bad job of letting characters shine when they weren't Naruto or Sasuke. This extends to other male characters too.\n\nEdit: I feel like a lot of writers act like women are aliens or something when we aren't. We can have the same motivations and flaws as men. Also fucking hate the idea that \"oh she's the one girl in the trio, she has to be in love with one of them.\" Nah bitch. Women and men can be friends. My favorite women that have been out recently have been in JJK. JoJo's also has great women. It's not impossible to be a shounen and still do your female characters justice.",

Even TenTen, being the argably weakest character of her gen, takes the So6Ps ninja tools becoming godly in power, refuses to elaborate, and doesn't feel pressured to marry because she knows there aren't any men worth her in the village.  \n\n\nAlso, there aren't any women in JoJo.

Putting her love for sasuke behind as a teenage crush and wanting back her teammate and friend instead. Being part of putting sasuke in his place when it comes to his plans. Having sakura be the one making him rea\u00f8ize that revenge will get him nowhere and that despite she not having lost her family she can still understand people around her is suffering. Letting Sasuke know that despite his shitty situation that he is not special and certainly not the only one suffering in this shinobi world. Sakura should have been the one to become an adult amongst them.",

I find it hard to compare Sakura to him when Krillin is a much more proficient fighter for most of the series. Sakura is only really useful during the exams when both Naruto and Sasuke are knocked out, and is probably a more knowledgeable ninja than all of the other leaf 11, but then does literally nothing useful. Sure she has a few moments in part 2 but she also lies to Naruto then tries to kill Sasuke alone because she thinks she can con him with her womanly charms. She does the dumbest shit, and it's probably because the writer wanted to put Sakura with Sasuke at the end of the series... Because nothing says love like multiple attempts at murder.",

When falling after Orochimaru knocked Naruto out, Sakura used a kunai yo stop his fall (Kakashi was worried earlier about Naruto falling out of a tree, so falling is still dangerous at this point).\n\n===\n\nAnyone who says Sakura in part one (manga) is a bad or only decent character doesn't know what they're talking about and need to stop reading so much Fanfiction. Without Sakura, Naruto & Sasuke dies at the very least in the Forest of Death... You may say they could have had a better team mate, but who that isn't already on a team?

I know there\u2019s a few filler episodes exploring it, but I think they could of done more. \n\nSasuke has a sub plot of killing itachi, and naruto wants to be hokage, what about Sakura? There could of been a cool medical related goal for them to establish for her to keep pushing her boundaries. Maybe there\u2019s an arc where she can\u2019t save someone in time and then strives to keep growing in her skills to never let it happen again etc. \n\nIt just seemed like naruto and sasuke even beyond power levels were getting constant new developments to enhance their character. Sakura started out SO STRONG in my opinion, like a great platform for some cool stuff, but it felt like midway through they kinda stopped, which was a shame. \n\nI don\u2019t think Sakura is useless, she\u2019s not nearly as useful as sasuke or naruto, but most characters aren\u2019t, she had a lot of awesome achievements esrly on and then in the war arc as a medical ninja, but I think considering her status as the second lead, they could of done more.

Power creep did a real number on Sakura\u2019s character development, mainly because she didn\u2019t get anything close to the upgrades that Sasuke and Naruto got like the Curse Mark, Sharingan, Mangekyo and EMS, Ameterasu, Susanoo, Rinnegan, Kurama, sage mode, etcetera. All she had was the training from Tsunade. Kishimoto didn\u2019t do her justice.",

Sakura funnels it into her muscles on a level no one else can compare to, and she funneled 3 years worth of it through her body into Obito over like a minute. Sakura essentially did 3 years of training over a few seconds to minutes. For comparison, Naruto in the 2 year gap between Shippudden and The Last went from needing help against Kaguya to one shotting Toneri who was the strongest enemy they had faced up until that point.\n\nSo if 2 years of training for them at that age gets Naruto there, imagine Sakura who was already in base relative to KCM1/2 doing 3 years of it.",

Even TenTen, being the argably weakest character of her gen, takes the So6Ps ninja tools becoming godly in power, refuses to elaborate, and doesn't feel pressured to marry because she knows there aren't any men worth her in the village.  \n\n\nAlso, there aren't any women in JoJo.

Quite honestly, I'm appalled at the nature of the Naruto fanbase. I thought we were better than this, but apparently not. What would your grandmothers think?",

The original point is someone said Sakura is like Krillin, not the best fighter but still a great character. You said that she\u2019s really only useful when Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, even though she\u2019s a professional healer and a key character in the entire series. You proceed to then say that Krillin is actually the strongest human. I then go on to counter that. The same way you said that Sakura isn\u2019t useful unless Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, I pointed out that Krillin isn\u2019t actually the strongest human unless you remove 17, 18, and Tien from the equation. This is actually a perfectly valid point that shows the flaw and stupidity in your argument.",

Sakura funnels it into her muscles on a level no one else can compare to, and she funneled 3 years worth of it through her body into Obito over like a minute. Sakura essentially did 3 years of training over a few seconds to minutes. For comparison, Naruto in the 2 year gap between Shippudden and The Last went from needing help against Kaguya to one shotting Toneri who was the strongest enemy they had faced up until that point.\n\nSo if 2 years of training for them at that age gets Naruto there, imagine Sakura who was already in base relative to KCM1/2 doing 3 years of it.",

The original point is someone said Sakura is like Krillin, not the best fighter but still a great character. You said that she\u2019s really only useful when Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, even though she\u2019s a professional healer and a key character in the entire series. You proceed to then say that Krillin is actually the strongest human. I then go on to counter that. The same way you said that Sakura isn\u2019t useful unless Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, I pointed out that Krillin isn\u2019t actually the strongest human unless you remove 17, 18, and Tien from the equation. This is actually a perfectly valid point that shows the flaw and stupidity in your argument.",

You proceed to then say that Krillin is actually the strongest human. I then go on to counter that. The same way you said that Sakura isn\u2019t useful unless Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, I pointed out that Krillin isn\u2019t actually the strongest human unless you remove 17, 18, and Tien from the equation.

The same way you said that Sakura isn\u2019t useful unless Naruto and Sasuke are incapacitated, I pointed out that Krillin isn\u2019t actually the strongest human unless you remove 17, 18, and Tien from the equation.
