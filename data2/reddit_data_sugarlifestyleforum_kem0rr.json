    "body": "I am not sure where I am going here so just bear with me.\n\nI had a great arrangement previously. After many failed starts and many cups of coffee, I finally met her.\n\nWe were both nervous at the meet. But the conversation just flow like the river Thames. Coffee turn into waffles and then into dinner. We literally talked for nearly 6 hrs at the first meet. I cancelled my day and she made changes to her plans. We discussed everything. From our previous lost loves, to expectation, to finance. \n\n I was born poor in Asia and she was born poor in Russia.  We both came to UK as poor foreign students. She's going through exactly the same problems I had 30 years ago. She's working part time at the local super market to help with finances but it is affecting her studies. Hence she's in the bowl.\n\nDid I mention that she's drop dead gorgeous? Just Google beautiful russian women and you know what I mean. She's the first Russian that I get to know well. They do make strong women in Russia. She has a very strong determination and very strong will. But she has a very soft heart as well. It is no wonder what the Germans lost the eastern front. And they were just fighting against their men.\n\nTook me a long time to understand Russian humour and that she always meant what she said. And what she didn't say, she didn't mean it. Yes, that's right. There's no point second guessing it.\n\nWe meet up twice a week. Always dinner at some random start up place, a show at West end. Weekend getaways in the country side. Long walks in the rain. She's not much of a city girl. She rather hike for miles in the mud than walking in the mall. She loved Wales. When she first saw the mountains in Wales, she told me it really reminded her of home.\n\nWe traveled to many European cities. We made a list and take turns to plan the next adventure. We had our first pot together in Amsterdam. We had our first water smoke together in Istanbul. And we had our first naked sauna together in Finland. I taught her snowboarding while she taught me Ice skating. Took her on a sailing holiday on a yacht and she made me promise not to make her that seasick again \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe had our little arguments. But it is always because we were trying to think what the other would have preferred. In the end, we promised to each other that we would always be honest and say what's in our mind so that we don't have to second guess each other.\n\nWhen covid struck, we were planning to just stay put in London. I will take care of her and she knew I would. At this stage, we were beyond arrangement. I had a direct debit to her every month. And if she's lacking in anything, she can just get it on my credit card. She has my PayPal login etc and we shared an Amazon account.\n\nHowever, as the lock down was starting, her parents panicked and demanded that she fly home. And so she left. This was her last year at the university and her family has lined up a job for her back home. We knew we will never see each other again. I bought her one way ticket home as a gift. I didn't see her off at the airport as we don't think we can managed that. We had agreed that it is better if we just stop contacting each other as nothing good is going to come out of it.\n\nIt's been 8 months since she left London. The lock down was lifted, adjusted and we are in another one now.\n\nI started browsing on seeking a few months ago. Been on a few meets and dates. I tried to forget about her by seeing other sb. But I just cannot forget about her. I find myself comparing them to her.... And of course this caused the failure of many arrangement.\n\nFor the last months, I just stopped dating completely. I am now just surfing seeking and wondering if I will ever find someone like her again.\n\nFor those of you who have found each other. Treasure the time you have. Sugar relationships are not meant to last. But you never know when it will end.\n\nStay safe.",

            "body": "I feel you.\n\nI had a similar experience. SB of 1.5 years was the most amazing woman I've ever met. I never understood how a man could be faithful to one woman until I met her. We had the best sex and the best experiences outside the bedroom.\n\nBut there was a catch.\n\nShe hadn't quite given up on the idea of having babies. I myself have two adult children. I wasn't opposed to having more children in theory, but I knew that she and I had radically different ideas about child-rearing (her, Latina, Catholic, ok with corporal punishment; me gringo, atheist and permissive). I had no doubt that we'd be fighting constantly if we tried to raise children together\n\nLast January she met a guy that she felt she could give one last shot at love/marriage/babies with. I knew that this day could come. I wished her well. \n\nBut it sucked. I went on a few SA dates. I met lovely, sweet women; several of whom I would have been mad for prior to her. But after - I couldn't go forward. I knew I'd always be comparing them to her and that wasn't fair.\n\nThen covid-19 hit and I just stopped seeing anyone. And it sucked. I was in Miami. The weather was beautiful. I'd take my boat out for pointless cruises and regret that I didn't have anyone to share them with.\n\nThe happy ending was that five months later she's done with love and children and wants to know if we can resume our arrangement. Yes. HELL YES. We're going out on the boat this weekend.",
