It's not about being rational or logical, but about someone who's father died because they are slaves to the other person. Hinata is just as bad as the rest of the clan as she's way too passive. Yeah, she may not want slaves, but she also isn't going to do anything about the slaves either. She will just bow her head and keep on keeping on. \"Evil prevails when good ppl do nothing\" is what Hinata seems to be all about from his perspective.\n\n===\n\nHell, from what I've seen, the Hyuuga never was changed in Boruto. Sure Naruto's kids aren't ever going to get branded because, ha, Naruto would burn the world down, but like, up until I just couldn't pay attention anymore they just don't mention this very important detail (one that ppl always tend to bring up when talking about Naruto lying to Neji). \n\n===\n\nSo, you have her telling him \"oh we're siblings\", which is super insulting when the reality is she's a princess and he's property. She can't even muster the backbone to at least not dangle a carrot in front of him. She can treat him nice without being naive at best and a total dick at worst. \n\n===\n\nNow, if Hinata actually had some balls to do something and was being nice/calling him a \"brother\" then sure that could work but as it is, Hinata was very much part of a problem and wasn't showing any signs (to teenagers mind you) of being any help to change the system. \n\n===\n\nAlso, Naruto totally lied to him about fate.

Like, If Hinata was supposed to be one of the figures to some how make Neji see that there can be peace between the Main & Cadets, then he wrote it very freaking poorly. Unless the point was to address that both are victims of their circumstances, and therefore someone like Hinata isn't exempt from a skewed way of addressing Neji's pain, even if she ment well. Personally, that's how I saw it, but I also saw it as Neji shouldn't succumb to that anger, which isn't gonna change anything, if he really wanted to change the Hyuga clan. Though, Shippuden addresses that both Main & Cadet Branch are united, but then Naruto mentions during Neji's dying moments that Neji was gonna help save the Hyuga...which makes me wonder more what were the internal politics going on during the years? Was it slowly working but having difficulties? Fuck if we know, cause Kishimoto was more focused on whatever Obito & Sasuke was doing. \n\nHonestly, this would have been a great arc to cover and show true change, if it wasn't overshadowed by the whole Sasuke, Akasuki shit, etc. Then again, I didn't expect Kishimoto to cover slavery in any nuanced way other than \"slavery bad, got better in the end\" in a tell but don't show sort of way.",

A lot of part is just badly written with some cool ideas and parts that just don't all work together cause too much was being done at the same time. \n\n===\n\nLots of potential but the worst thing to happen to Naruto is that it got HUGE.

They could have chose dissidents, edgy teen rogue nins specifically rebelling against a bubble gum pop world cause they haven't had it so easy or they just heard stories. The world is uncharacteristically safe, even in the real world in safer cities you have problems and they aren't laughable. The low level problems are like laughable and stupid and they pull them out in filler and have ninja beat by bandits or some people with no ninjutsu. So the ninjas overall are weak as hell. The only real problems are Ootsusukis and androids.   Every implementation of strife, or adversity has been lame and we get android saga instead. At every avenue they have lost that show is about ninjas, and instead chose technology. Idgaf about technology as a main focus, it should be a backdrop. I watched this show for stylized ninjas. \n\nThe tech people are so 11th hour and pulled out of their ass that it's laughable. Like where the fuck was Amado this whole time with the ability to get jiraiya's DNA and make these obscene androids? He showed up out of fucking nowhere if we're honest. No one has every heard of him, not even people related in that field, but he's the most technologically advanced person in the series and has all this Intel and shit. It's terrible writing and makes him seem so disconnected from the world at large. \n\n\nPeople also complain about power scaling. I don't think the top is out of wack. Like the main characters and such are fine. But the lower end of power scaling is what bothers me. Bandits and mere fodder filler characters beating ninja like konahamaru and making it seem everyone beyond main cast, even if pre-established a bit, is now trash tier. Filler was pretty bad in Naruto so I try not judge too harshly, but it's this low end power scaling which ofc causes the manga of Boruto to be far superior to the anime.",

The Anbu still exist, but the only threat is alien at this point, and nobody outside of plot armor can compete anymore.\n\nIt's like being upset that people now aren't ready to mobilize for war. Peace makes people soft, and that's what's happened. Never before had the Naruto verse seen such sustained peace. Bandits and the occasional fetch quest is a far cry from the chunin exams that we saw.\n\nWe also only saw 1 year of the exams, and while forest of death changed, the fights didn't.\n\nShikamaru passed because he did well on the test (still a requirement), showed he had the capability to apply strategy to a fight, and showed mercy to his opponent. He also demonstrated that in a fight he'd give up if he felt he won, which is a bad trait for a chunin to have.\n\nNeji is the only one who deserved chunin originally but his pride got in the way. Once he got rid of it, we see he is the first Jonin of the OG crew.",

With that said i kind of wish Boruto darkened up a bit. I think thats one of the issues sequels have, they lose the essence of the original idea and make changes that although are similar to the original it lacks that spirit.\n\nAn example i think of is pokemon, the show is not gen 1 to 3 from 4 onward it feels different to me, entirely.

It's not about being rational or logical, but about someone who's father died because they are slaves to the other person. Hinata is just as bad as the rest of the clan as she's way too passive. Yeah, she may not want slaves, but she also isn't going to do anything about the slaves either. She will just bow her head and keep on keeping on. \"Evil prevails when good ppl do nothing\" is what Hinata seems to be all about from his perspective.\n\n===\n\nHell, from what I've seen, the Hyuuga never was changed in Boruto. Sure Naruto's kids aren't ever going to get branded because, ha, Naruto would burn the world down, but like, up until I just couldn't pay attention anymore they just don't mention this very important detail (one that ppl always tend to bring up when talking about Naruto lying to Neji). \n\n===\n\nSo, you have her telling him \"oh we're siblings\", which is super insulting when the reality is she's a princess and he's property. She can't even muster the backbone to at least not dangle a carrot in front of him. She can treat him nice without being naive at best and a total dick at worst. \n\n===\n\nNow, if Hinata actually had some balls to do something and was being nice/calling him a \"brother\" then sure that could work but as it is, Hinata was very much part of a problem and wasn't showing any signs (to teenagers mind you) of being any help to change the system. \n\n===\n\nAlso, Naruto totally lied to him about fate.

Like, If Hinata was supposed to be one of the figures to some how make Neji see that there can be peace between the Main & Cadets, then he wrote it very freaking poorly. Unless the point was to address that both are victims of their circumstances, and therefore someone like Hinata isn't exempt from a skewed way of addressing Neji's pain, even if she ment well. Personally, that's how I saw it, but I also saw it as Neji shouldn't succumb to that anger, which isn't gonna change anything, if he really wanted to change the Hyuga clan. Though, Shippuden addresses that both Main & Cadet Branch are united, but then Naruto mentions during Neji's dying moments that Neji was gonna help save the Hyuga...which makes me wonder more what were the internal politics going on during the years? Was it slowly working but having difficulties? Fuck if we know, cause Kishimoto was more focused on whatever Obito & Sasuke was doing. \n\nHonestly, this would have been a great arc to cover and show true change, if it wasn't overshadowed by the whole Sasuke, Akasuki shit, etc. Then again, I didn't expect Kishimoto to cover slavery in any nuanced way other than \"slavery bad, got better in the end\" in a tell but don't show sort of way.",

They could have chose dissidents, edgy teen rogue nins specifically rebelling against a bubble gum pop world cause they haven't had it so easy or they just heard stories. The world is uncharacteristically safe, even in the real world in safer cities you have problems and they aren't laughable. The low level problems are like laughable and stupid and they pull them out in filler and have ninja beat by bandits or some people with no ninjutsu. So the ninjas overall are weak as hell. The only real problems are Ootsusukis and androids.   Every implementation of strife, or adversity has been lame and we get android saga instead. At every avenue they have lost that show is about ninjas, and instead chose technology. Idgaf about technology as a main focus, it should be a backdrop. I watched this show for stylized ninjas. \n\nThe tech people are so 11th hour and pulled out of their ass that it's laughable. Like where the fuck was Amado this whole time with the ability to get jiraiya's DNA and make these obscene androids? He showed up out of fucking nowhere if we're honest. No one has every heard of him, not even people related in that field, but he's the most technologically advanced person in the series and has all this Intel and shit. It's terrible writing and makes him seem so disconnected from the world at large. \n\n\nPeople also complain about power scaling. I don't think the top is out of wack. Like the main characters and such are fine. But the lower end of power scaling is what bothers me. Bandits and mere fodder filler characters beating ninja like konahamaru and making it seem everyone beyond main cast, even if pre-established a bit, is now trash tier. Filler was pretty bad in Naruto so I try not judge too harshly, but it's this low end power scaling which ofc causes the manga of Boruto to be far superior to the anime.",

It's not about being rational or logical, but about someone who's father died because they are slaves to the other person. Hinata is just as bad as the rest of the clan as she's way too passive. Yeah, she may not want slaves, but she also isn't going to do anything about the slaves either. She will just bow her head and keep on keeping on. \"Evil prevails when good ppl do nothing\" is what Hinata seems to be all about from his perspective.\n\n===\n\nHell, from what I've seen, the Hyuuga never was changed in Boruto. Sure Naruto's kids aren't ever going to get branded because, ha, Naruto would burn the world down, but like, up until I just couldn't pay attention anymore they just don't mention this very important detail (one that ppl always tend to bring up when talking about Naruto lying to Neji). \n\n===\n\nSo, you have her telling him \"oh we're siblings\", which is super insulting when the reality is she's a princess and he's property. She can't even muster the backbone to at least not dangle a carrot in front of him. She can treat him nice without being naive at best and a total dick at worst. \n\n===\n\nNow, if Hinata actually had some balls to do something and was being nice/calling him a \"brother\" then sure that could work but as it is, Hinata was very much part of a problem and wasn't showing any signs (to teenagers mind you) of being any help to change the system. \n\n===\n\nAlso, Naruto totally lied to him about fate.

Like, If Hinata was supposed to be one of the figures to some how make Neji see that there can be peace between the Main & Cadets, then he wrote it very freaking poorly. Unless the point was to address that both are victims of their circumstances, and therefore someone like Hinata isn't exempt from a skewed way of addressing Neji's pain, even if she ment well. Personally, that's how I saw it, but I also saw it as Neji shouldn't succumb to that anger, which isn't gonna change anything, if he really wanted to change the Hyuga clan. Though, Shippuden addresses that both Main & Cadet Branch are united, but then Naruto mentions during Neji's dying moments that Neji was gonna help save the Hyuga...which makes me wonder more what were the internal politics going on during the years? Was it slowly working but having difficulties? Fuck if we know, cause Kishimoto was more focused on whatever Obito & Sasuke was doing. \n\nHonestly, this would have been a great arc to cover and show true change, if it wasn't overshadowed by the whole Sasuke, Akasuki shit, etc. Then again, I didn't expect Kishimoto to cover slavery in any nuanced way other than \"slavery bad, got better in the end\" in a tell but don't show sort of way.",

The Anbu still exist, but the only threat is alien at this point, and nobody outside of plot armor can compete anymore.\n\nIt's like being upset that people now aren't ready to mobilize for war. Peace makes people soft, and that's what's happened. Never before had the Naruto verse seen such sustained peace. Bandits and the occasional fetch quest is a far cry from the chunin exams that we saw.\n\nWe also only saw 1 year of the exams, and while forest of death changed, the fights didn't.\n\nShikamaru passed because he did well on the test (still a requirement), showed he had the capability to apply strategy to a fight, and showed mercy to his opponent. He also demonstrated that in a fight he'd give up if he felt he won, which is a bad trait for a chunin to have.\n\nNeji is the only one who deserved chunin originally but his pride got in the way.

It's not about being rational or logical, but about someone who's father died because they are slaves to the other person. Hinata is just as bad as the rest of the clan as she's way too passive. Yeah, she may not want slaves, but she also isn't going to do anything about the slaves either. She will just bow her head and keep on keeping on. \"Evil prevails when good ppl do nothing\" is what Hinata seems to be all about from his perspective.\n\n===\n\nHell, from what I've seen, the Hyuuga never was changed in Boruto. Sure Naruto's kids aren't ever going to get branded because, ha, Naruto would burn the world down, but like, up until I just couldn't pay attention anymore they just don't mention this very important detail (one that ppl always tend to bring up when talking about Naruto lying to Neji). \n\n===\n\nSo, you have her telling him \"oh we're siblings\", which is super insulting when the reality is she's a princess and he's property. She can't even muster the backbone to at least not dangle a carrot in front of him. She can treat him nice without being naive at best and a total dick at worst. \n\n===\n\nNow, if Hinata actually had some balls to do something and was being nice/calling him a \"brother\" then sure that could work but as it is, Hinata was very much part of a problem and wasn't showing any signs (to teenagers mind you) of being any help to change the system. \n\n===\n\nAlso, Naruto totally lied to him about fate. Really funny when you think about it",

Like, If Hinata was supposed to be one of the figures to some how make Neji see that there can be peace between the Main & Cadets, then he wrote it very freaking poorly. Unless the point was to address that both are victims of their circumstances, and therefore someone like Hinata isn't exempt from a skewed way of addressing Neji's pain, even if she ment well. Personally, that's how I saw it, but I also saw it as Neji shouldn't succumb to that anger, which isn't gonna change anything, if he really wanted to change the Hyuga clan. Though, Shippuden addresses that both Main & Cadet Branch are united, but then Naruto mentions during Neji's dying moments that Neji was gonna help save the Hyuga...which makes me wonder more what were the internal politics going on during the years? Was it slowly working but having difficulties? Fuck if we know, cause Kishimoto was more focused on whatever Obito & Sasuke was doing. \n\nHonestly, this would have been a great arc to cover and show true change, if it wasn't overshadowed by the whole Sasuke, Akasuki shit, etc. Then again, I didn't expect Kishimoto to cover slavery in any nuanced way other than \"slavery bad, got better in the end\" in a tell but don't show sort of way.",

A lot of part is just badly written with some cool ideas and parts that just don't all work together cause too much was being done at the same time. \n\n===\n\nLots of potential but the worst thing to happen to Naruto is that it got HUGE.

She will just bow her head and keep on keeping on. \"Evil prevails when good ppl do nothing\" is what Hinata seems to be all about from his perspective.\n\n===\n\nHell, from what I've seen, the Hyuuga never was changed in Boruto. Sure Naruto's kids aren't ever going to get branded because, ha, Naruto would burn the world down, but like, up until I just couldn't pay attention anymore they just don't mention this very important detail (one that ppl always tend to bring up when talking about Naruto lying to Neji). \n\n===\n\nSo, you have her telling him \"oh we're siblings\", which is super insulting when the reality is she's a princess and he's property. She can't even muster the backbone to at least not dangle a carrot in front of him. She can treat him nice without being naive at best and a total dick at worst. \n\n===\n\nNow, if Hinata actually had some balls to do something and was being nice/calling him a \"brother\" then sure that could work but as it is, Hinata was very much part of a problem and wasn't showing any signs (to teenagers mind you) of being any help to change the system. \n\n===\n\nAlso, Naruto totally lied to him about fate.

Like, If Hinata was supposed to be one of the figures to some how make Neji see that there can be peace between the Main & Cadets, then he wrote it very freaking poorly. Unless the point was to address that both are victims of their circumstances, and therefore someone like Hinata isn't exempt from a skewed way of addressing Neji's pain, even if she ment well. Personally, that's how I saw it, but I also saw it as Neji shouldn't succumb to that anger, which isn't gonna change anything, if he really wanted to change the Hyuga clan. Though, Shippuden addresses that both Main & Cadet Branch are united, but then Naruto mentions during Neji's dying moments that Neji was gonna help save the Hyuga...which makes me wonder more what were the internal politics going on during the years? Was it slowly working but having difficulties? Fuck if we know, cause Kishimoto was more focused on whatever Obito & Sasuke was doing. \n\nHonestly, this would have been a great arc to cover and show true change, if it wasn't overshadowed by the whole Sasuke, Akasuki shit, etc. Then again, I didn't expect Kishimoto to cover slavery in any nuanced way other than \"slavery bad, got better in the end\" in a tell but don't show sort of way.",

He also demonstrated that in a fight he'd give up if he felt he won, which is a bad trait for a chunin to have.\n\nNeji is the only one who deserved chunin originally but his pride got in the way.

Hinata is just as bad as the rest of the clan as she's way too passive. Yeah, she may not want slaves, but she also isn't going to do anything about the slaves either. She will just bow her head and keep on keeping on. \"Evil prevails when good ppl do nothing\" is what Hinata seems to be all about from his perspective.\n\n===\n\nHell, from what I've seen, the Hyuuga never was changed in Boruto. Sure Naruto's kids aren't ever going to get branded because, ha, Naruto would burn the world down, but like, up until I just couldn't pay attention anymore they just don't mention this very important detail (one that ppl always tend to bring up when talking about Naruto lying to Neji). \n\n===\n\nSo, you have her telling him \"oh we're siblings\", which is super insulting when the reality is she's a princess and he's property. She can't even muster the backbone to at least not dangle a carrot in front of him. She can treat him nice without being naive at best and a total dick at worst. \n\n===\n\nNow, if Hinata actually had some balls to do something and was being nice/calling him a \"brother\" then sure that could work but as it is, Hinata was very much part of a problem and wasn't showing any signs (to teenagers mind you) of being any help to change the system. \n\n===\n\nAlso, Naruto totally lied to him about fate.
