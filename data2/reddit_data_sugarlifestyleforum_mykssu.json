I spent much if my early years being ostracized by straights, gays, and lesbians because I wasn't them. The heterosexuals discriminated, shamed, and physically assaulted me for holding hands with my girlfriend in public. Lesbians would outright shun me and tell me that I was just confused. \n\nYou play with labling your sexuality however the wind blows.

I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople.

Nothing wrong with that- just incompatible expectations of norms.\n\nFor the record, I\u2019ve reflected on why it is that my vanilla dates are so much slower to progress to intimacy. I think it\u2019s precisely that I *don\u2019t* plant the seed early in the courtship process out of deference to female-authored dating advice.

But I also don\u2019t become intimate in vanilla until something like the 5th or 6th date, and I am not happy with that. So I think there\u2019s an appropriate time frame to start hinting at intimate intentions. But defining that time frame, I think, is going to vary from person to person. I would hazard a guess that if the man were stunningly attractive \u201ctotal package\u201d material, he could get away with sexting before a first date. And a more average looking man would have to delay until some time after the first date begins. Maybe this guy was fairly attractive and is trying to decide between OP and 2-3 other women. Trying to figure out who is or isn\u2019t \u201cfuck yes\u201d interested early on is an appropriate course of action, and I would imagine that hinting at intimacy is one valid way to assess that. All of this is speculation, of course.\n\nMy point is, there are some women who go on dates for free meals (particularly in large HCOL metros), some who go on dates with guys they\u2019re not super into, and others who seem to go on dates with guys they are already fairly into. An SD like me doesn\u2019t really give a damn about the wasted money on pointless dates, but I *do* care about the wasted time and energy directed at sub-par matches. A regular vanilla guy shares my concerns, *and I would think* is also somewhat cost conscious. If I piss away 1k on a half dozen or so dates over a month, I\u2019m not sweating it. But for someone who makes say 50-80k/yr, that 1k is much more significant.",

If you make a girl feel special (pay attention to what she says, ask her about herself and not only talk about yourself, etc etc) she will be a lot more likely to want to sleep with you on the second date (maybe even the first if you have a really great time on the date) there\u2019s a reason a lot of conventionally unattractive men who are not rich do get very good looking women to be with them, and it\u2019s because how you act can make or break your attractiveness and sexiness to women more than your actual physical appearance. I don\u2019t think you should suggest going to your place during the dinner at all unless the subject comes up about what to do next. This should be a natural thing because you\u2019re having such a great time that you don\u2019t want the night to end. If you bring it up so early it just makes it sound like sex is all you care about and you\u2019re just going through the motions of the date to get to sex, and even if a person was open to it before this will turn them off.",

I don't try to pretend to know the plight of POC in America, but I respect their fight and choose to fight alongside. Can I ask the same of you for those of us who are fighting against hatred and discrimination because of who we love?",

Because it hurts when people talk so flippantly and with careless disregard over aspects of your life that society has hated so much, they are willing to torture, rape, and assault you for simply existing. Did those things happen to me? Yes. Why? I was holding hands with my girlfriend and walking down the sidewalk. So, I protested for change. I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople. I train, coach, and guide business leaders into a better, more inclusive mindset.",

But I also don\u2019t become intimate in vanilla until something like the 5th or 6th date, and I am not happy with that. So I think there\u2019s an appropriate time frame to start hinting at intimate intentions. But defining that time frame, I think, is going to vary from person to person. I would hazard a guess that if the man were stunningly attractive \u201ctotal package\u201d material, he could get away with sexting before a first date. And a more average looking man would have to delay until some time after the first date begins. Maybe this guy was fairly attractive and is trying to decide between OP and 2-3 other women. Trying to figure out who is or isn\u2019t \u201cfuck yes\u201d interested early on is an appropriate course of action, and I would imagine that hinting at intimacy is one valid way to assess that. All of this is speculation, of course.\n\nMy point is, there are some women who go on dates for free meals (particularly in large HCOL metros), some who go on dates with guys they\u2019re not super into, and others who seem to go on dates with guys they are already fairly into. An SD like me doesn\u2019t really give a damn about the wasted money on pointless dates, but I *do* care about the wasted time and energy directed at sub-par matches. A regular vanilla guy shares my concerns, *and I would think* is also somewhat cost conscious. If I piss away 1k on a half dozen or so dates over a month, I\u2019m not sweating it. But for someone who makes say 50-80k/yr, that 1k is much more significant.",

If you make a girl feel special (pay attention to what she says, ask her about herself and not only talk about yourself, etc etc) she will be a lot more likely to want to sleep with you on the second date (maybe even the first if you have a really great time on the date) there\u2019s a reason a lot of conventionally unattractive men who are not rich do get very good looking women to be with them, and it\u2019s because how you act can make or break your attractiveness and sexiness to women more than your actual physical appearance. I don\u2019t think you should suggest going to your place during the dinner at all unless the subject comes up about what to do next. This should be a natural thing because you\u2019re having such a great time that you don\u2019t want the night to end. If you bring it up so early it just makes it sound like sex is all you care about and you\u2019re just going through the motions of the date to get to sex, and even if a person was open to it before this will turn them off.",

Did those things happen to me? Yes. Why? I was holding hands with my girlfriend and walking down the sidewalk. So, I protested for change. I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople.

But I also don\u2019t become intimate in vanilla until something like the 5th or 6th date, and I am not happy with that. So I think there\u2019s an appropriate time frame to start hinting at intimate intentions. But defining that time frame, I think, is going to vary from person to person. I would hazard a guess that if the man were stunningly attractive \u201ctotal package\u201d material, he could get away with sexting before a first date. And a more average looking man would have to delay until some time after the first date begins. Maybe this guy was fairly attractive and is trying to decide between OP and 2-3 other women. Trying to figure out who is or isn\u2019t \u201cfuck yes\u201d interested early on is an appropriate course of action, and I would imagine that hinting at intimacy is one valid way to assess that. All of this is speculation, of course.\n\nMy point is, there are some women who go on dates for free meals (particularly in large HCOL metros), some who go on dates with guys they\u2019re not super into, and others who seem to go on dates with guys they are already fairly into. An SD like me doesn\u2019t really give a damn about the wasted money on pointless dates, but I *do* care about the wasted time and energy directed at sub-par matches. A regular vanilla guy shares my concerns, *and I would think* is also somewhat cost conscious. If I piss away 1k on a half dozen or so dates over a month, I\u2019m not sweating it. But for someone who makes say 50-80k/yr, that 1k is much more significant.",

If you make a girl feel special (pay attention to what she says, ask her about herself and not only talk about yourself, etc etc) she will be a lot more likely to want to sleep with you on the second date (maybe even the first if you have a really great time on the date) there\u2019s a reason a lot of conventionally unattractive men who are not rich do get very good looking women to be with them, and it\u2019s because how you act can make or break your attractiveness and sexiness to women more than your actual physical appearance. I don\u2019t think you should suggest going to your place during the dinner at all unless the subject comes up about what to do next. This should be a natural thing because you\u2019re having such a great time that you don\u2019t want the night to end. If you bring it up so early it just makes it sound like sex is all you care about and you\u2019re just going through the motions of the date to get to sex, and even if a person was open to it before this will turn them off.",

Did those things happen to me? Yes. Why? I was holding hands with my girlfriend and walking down the sidewalk. So, I protested for change. I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople. I train, coach, and guide business leaders into a better, more inclusive mindset.",

I don\u2019t think you should suggest going to your place during the dinner at all unless the subject comes up about what to do next. This should be a natural thing because you\u2019re having such a great time that you don\u2019t want the night to end. If you bring it up so early it just makes it sound like sex is all you care about and you\u2019re just going through the motions of the date to get to sex, and even if a person was open to it before this will turn them off.",

Because it hurts when people talk so flippantly and with careless disregard over aspects of your life that society has hated so much, they are willing to torture, rape, and assault you for simply existing. Did those things happen to me? Yes. Why? I was holding hands with my girlfriend and walking down the sidewalk. So, I protested for change. I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople. I train, coach, and guide business leaders into a better, more inclusive mindset.",

Because it hurts when people talk so flippantly and with careless disregard over aspects of your life that society has hated so much, they are willing to torture, rape, and assault you for simply existing. Did those things happen to me? Yes. Why? I was holding hands with my girlfriend and walking down the sidewalk. So, I protested for change. I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople. I train, coach, and guide business leaders into a better, more inclusive mindset.",

Because it hurts when people talk so flippantly and with careless disregard over aspects of your life that society has hated so much, they are willing to torture, rape, and assault you for simply existing. Did those things happen to me? Yes. Why? I was holding hands with my girlfriend and walking down the sidewalk. So, I protested for change. I did candelight vigils, protest walks, die ins with ACT UP...and attended funerals. \n\nWhy am I explaining when you just don't care? Well, someone will-even if you don't. I inevitably get a kind word from someone who learned something, or a hurting soul who needed a verbal embrace and acknowledgement for their pain. I refuse to remain quiet and hidden when I read about some woman, pissed off at a bad date, who decides to tell the schmuck that she's a lesbian.\n\nAs far as what I do with POC. I protest for change, I donate to causes that enact change, I vote for bills and politicians who want change, and in my professional work, I spearhead diversity in the workplace, I lobby with my professional network to congresspeople. I train, coach, and guide business leaders into a better, more inclusive mindset.",
