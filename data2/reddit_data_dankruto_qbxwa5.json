IIRC the fics had the explanation that they would want the Byakugan to be introduced in the kage's bloodline because 1. he's the kage and 2. because the Raikage's family has superhuman body genetics and they also specialize in taijutsu, so the Byakugan would boost that greately.",

Or why a genius 14 year old that slaughters his family after some creep in authority coerces him into doing it by holding his baby brother's life hostage wouldn't be charged as an adult.\n\nThe adults around him saying, \"Itachi was big brain hokage child hurr hurr\" is just them trying to push their guilt and responsibility for what happened off on a kid, when it was the adult's fault all that shit happened in the first place. \n\nHiruzen definitely is responsible in part due to his inaction and incompetent leadership, but he and the fire daimyo did not orchestrate the slaughter.

                            "body": "It has one of the most famous reviews on reddit, and is the most infamous fanfic of all time.\n\nCredit to u/The_Real_DirtyDan01 for writing this up recently, whose points I wholeheartedly agree with:\n\nNaruto vs Sasuke: The Aftermath.\n\nI can say with 100% confidence that this is one of, if not the worst Naruto fanfic on this site. Imagine a fic with every clich\u00e9 that this subreddit hates and is shoved into a story that attempts to take them seriously. Now take that and multiply it by 10 and you\u2019ll start to feel the pain I felt when I first read this train wreck back in my early days. It starts off after the VOTE fight at the end of Part 1 before going downhill.\n\nCharacters:\n\nEvery character in this fic is nothing more than a plot device to further praise Naruto. Many are inaccurately portrayed to make him look better and suck him off more than TenTen did Neji during the Chunin Exams.\n\nOne particular example is with Lee. Apparently, sometime after the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Lee attempted suicide. I don\u2019t really remember why, but it\u2019s not that important to the topic. So everyone wonders where tf Lee has been for the past few days. Naruto sneaks into the hospital at night to meet up with Lee, only to find out he\u2019s been put under suicide watch. This has caused a falling out between Lee and Gai, as Gai is disappointed he would try to extinguish his flames of youth\n\nNow, this could\u2019ve been an interesting way to take Lee\u2019s character, as most fics don\u2019t really do much with his character beyond canon. But instead of taking that chance, the author instead turns Lee\u2019s attempted suicide about Naruto. While they\u2019re talking, Lee then made the biggest mistake of his life; he said Naruto wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\nThis of course triggered Naruto\u2019s tragic backstory, with the author seemingly forgetting this was about Lee and going on a long tirade about how Naruto tried to kill himself, his happy attitude was an emotional mask, his team hates him; you know, the typical flanderization of Naruto\u2019s childhood to make us \u2018sympathize\u2019 with him more.\n\nYes, this dude made Lee\u2019s suicide more about Naruto then Lee. It\u2019s a prime example of how everything revolves around Naruto. And then Lee is no longer sad because our savior Naruto made his suicidal tendencies and depression go away with that typical charm of his. Because that\u2019s how mental health works apparently.\n\nHowever, the worst was with the \u2018villains\u2019.\n\nThis dude turned Sasuke into a rapist sociopathic monster. There\u2019s an entire chapter spent with Part 1 Sasuke raping Part 1 Sakura in detail. He then pisses on her and leaves her to be raped again by Sound Nin. Let me reiterate once again.\n\nThis man wrote child-on-child rape for cheap drama.\n\nHe gives no reasoning as to why Sasuke is like this, he just is. The moment he learns Hinata is with Naruto, he says he\u2019s gonna rape her. He wines to Orochimaru like a spoiled little boy and it butchers his character to a level I\u2019ve never seen.\n\nSpeaking of Orochimaru, he\u2019s turned into a literal fucking pedophile. You know, that joke that was somewhat funny back in like 2007? It\u2019s treated seriously here. Orochimaru literally has sex with Part 1 Sasuke. None of his intelligence in canon is shown whatsoever. He just lives to fuck Sasuke. And he also wants to rape Tsunade because reasons.\n\nKabuto is the third wheel and doesn\u2019t really do much besides wanting to rape Kurenai because this guy couldn\u2019t write a good villain if you put a gun to his head. They\u2019re always a rapist because writing a villain with nuance is just too much for this guy to do. Gotta make them ultra evil so the audience knows how to feel.\n\nPlot:\n\nYou tell me. The story pretty much came to a halt after the time skip. It\u2019s just one big circlejerk of people congratulation Hinata on being impregnated by and marrying our glorious Naruto-sama. Did I also mention they live in Minato\u2019s secret mansion, that stupid clich\u00e9 that makes no sense because Minato is way too humble to buy a fucking mansion? But whatever, gotta give Naruto some way to learn Flying Thunder God.\n\nAnd before that, it was just poorly done romance between 13-year-olds and pointless drama.\n\nWriting:\n\nThis guy\u2019s writing is so fucking transparent, it hurts. He writes these long paragraphs of fluff that could be condensed down to a couple of sentences. You\u2019ll read an entire paragraph but feel like you\u2019ve read nothing at all.\n\nThis also means the length of the story is kinda a lie as a large majority of it is just fluff. The chapters are long, and I mean long. The first 5 chapters alone has like 15,000 words and the entire fic itself is almost 1 million words, so it\u2019s a struggle to get through.\n\nHe also uses Japanese multiple times, which disrupts the flow of the already bad writing. And the thing is, he translates them in parenthesis right after. So what\u2019s the point of the Japanese? The dialogue used here is absolute shit. I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n\n\"Now the Hyuga bitch, that's another story! I'd like to strap her to a table right now and have her churn out Uchiha's for the next twenty years! Orochimaru Sensei, please oh pretty please, may we go get the Hyuga girl and do just that?\"\n\n\"Hinata may no longer be a hime to you Hyuga, but she'll always be my hime \" Naruto replied with a smile on his face, as Hinata turned beet red and her heart melted at Naruto's sweet words of affection.\"\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know you from somewhere? I know where I\u2019ve seen you before, you\u2019re one of the whorekage\u2019s Jounin aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPlease end me.\n\nRomace:\n\nEasily the worst aspect of this fic. Naruto and Hinata get together in like one chapter, with Hinata acting extremely OOC character and just confessing to Naruto on the spot. And of course, Naruto realizes he loves her (despite them almost never interacting before this) and they start dating. Because that\u2019s obviously what I came to see; two twelve-year olds kissing and shit. He also has couples give each other pet names like \u201cNaru-kun\u201d and \u201cHime\u201d, or Kurenai calling Kakashi \u201cKashi-kun\u201d and it makes me want to put a bullet through my head.\n\nAnd the sex scenes are fucking atrocious. Stop reading this right now, go to Chapter 61, and read it for yourself.\n\nAre you back? That shit was trash wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s literally every hentai you\u2019ve seen, but in written form. This sound like how a 14 year old thinks sex works.\n\nThe author also has a habit of making people antagonistic out of nowhere to satisfy the ships. He made Asuma an asshole just to satisfy the Kakashi/Kurenai ship. He also made Kiba an asshole so satisfy the NaruHina ship.\n\nA particular example is after everyone found out about Sakura\u2019s rape, Kiba\u2019s reaction is essentially \u201cwelp, she\u2019s ruined. Guess I can\u2019t fuck her now.\u201d\n\nThis is usually a thing writers to when they can\u2019t write romance; just make all potential love interest assholes so we have no choice but to ship the two main characters, because writing realistic romance actually takes effort and can\u2019t just be done on a whim.\n\nBashing:\n\nWouldn\u2019t be a shit story without some good ole bashing.\n\nThe main target, as I\u2019m sure you can guess, is Sakura.\n\nThis dude seems to have a hate boner for her, as she goes through some of the most horrific shit in the story. She\u2019s constantly yelled at and belittled by everyone around her, is raped by her teammate and a group of grown men and is further belittled. Her behavior from before is heavily flanderized. Apparently she\u2019s verbally/physically abused Naruto in the past and never liked him.\n\nWhich is false. All the times she hits him is played for laughs and is nothing more than comedy. Not to mention it barely happens in the manga; the anime just played it up for filler. And the \u201cverbal abuse\u201d is literally just her calling Naruto an idiot sometimes, which is true.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Sakura\u2019s character, that\u2019s fine. But writing her being gangraped as a child is just atrocious.\n\nKakashi\u2019s bashed somewhat as well because he favored Sasuke apparently, despite the fact he never did. The only time he did was when he fought Gaara, and Sasuke needed it because Gaara could tank a Hidden Lotus from 5 Gates Lee, couldn\u2019t be touched unless you had faster-than-sight speed, was a Jinchuriki, and killed almost everyone he fights. Sasuke was fighting for his life, not Naruto. Not to mention he got Ebisu, who is said to be an elite trainer, to train Naruto. He\u2019s also mad Naruto didn\u2019t get Chidori, despite the fact you need a Sharingan to counteract the tunnel vision. He also claims Kakashi never liked Naruto, despite Kakashi saving them against Zabuza and the Demon Brothers.\n\nBut nope, gotta keep with the narrative that everyone\u2019s against Naruto\n\nSasuke\u2019s bashed, too, but I feel I don\u2019t have to explain any further.\n\nThere\u2019s more, but I don\u2019t feel like explaining, so I\u2019ll just list them:\n\nEvil Hiashi, Evil Sakura\u2019s mom, Evil Civilian Council, Evil Civilians, etc. Basically, everyone who doesn\u2019t suck off Naruto is bashed.\n\nPower scaling:\n\nAnd the final punch to the teeth is a power wank. Jiraiya is one-shotted by Part 1 Naruto using a little of Kurama\u2019s chakra, Hinata beats Mangekyo Sharingan Sasuke, and Tsunade can clap Orochimaru, who was able to keep up with her despite having no working arms.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis story is a pile of shit and is a prime example of how reviews don\u2019t always equal story quality. I usually try not to judge what people read; everyone\u2019s tastes are different. However, I refuse to accept that anyone could like this fic unless they\u2019re like 12. It\u2019s the bottom barrel of this community and I will always loathe its existence",

IIRC the fics had the explanation that they would want the Byakugan to be introduced in the kage's bloodline because 1. he's the kage and 2. because the Raikage's family has superhuman body genetics and they also specialize in taijutsu, so the Byakugan would boost that greately.",

                {
                    "body": "It has one of the most famous reviews on reddit, and is the most infamous fanfic of all time.\n\nCredit to u/The_Real_DirtyDan01 for writing this up recently, whose points I wholeheartedly agree with:\n\nNaruto vs Sasuke: The Aftermath.\n\nI can say with 100% confidence that this is one of, if not the worst Naruto fanfic on this site. Imagine a fic with every clich\u00e9 that this subreddit hates and is shoved into a story that attempts to take them seriously. Now take that and multiply it by 10 and you\u2019ll start to feel the pain I felt when I first read this train wreck back in my early days. It starts off after the VOTE fight at the end of Part 1 before going downhill.\n\nCharacters:\n\nEvery character in this fic is nothing more than a plot device to further praise Naruto. Many are inaccurately portrayed to make him look better and suck him off more than TenTen did Neji during the Chunin Exams.\n\nOne particular example is with Lee. Apparently, sometime after the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Lee attempted suicide. I don\u2019t really remember why, but it\u2019s not that important to the topic. So everyone wonders where tf Lee has been for the past few days. Naruto sneaks into the hospital at night to meet up with Lee, only to find out he\u2019s been put under suicide watch. This has caused a falling out between Lee and Gai, as Gai is disappointed he would try to extinguish his flames of youth\n\nNow, this could\u2019ve been an interesting way to take Lee\u2019s character, as most fics don\u2019t really do much with his character beyond canon. But instead of taking that chance, the author instead turns Lee\u2019s attempted suicide about Naruto. While they\u2019re talking, Lee then made the biggest mistake of his life; he said Naruto wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\nThis of course triggered Naruto\u2019s tragic backstory, with the author seemingly forgetting this was about Lee and going on a long tirade about how Naruto tried to kill himself, his happy attitude was an emotional mask, his team hates him; you know, the typical flanderization of Naruto\u2019s childhood to make us \u2018sympathize\u2019 with him more.\n\nYes, this dude made Lee\u2019s suicide more about Naruto then Lee. It\u2019s a prime example of how everything revolves around Naruto. And then Lee is no longer sad because our savior Naruto made his suicidal tendencies and depression go away with that typical charm of his. Because that\u2019s how mental health works apparently.\n\nHowever, the worst was with the \u2018villains\u2019.\n\nThis dude turned Sasuke into a rapist sociopathic monster. There\u2019s an entire chapter spent with Part 1 Sasuke raping Part 1 Sakura in detail. He then pisses on her and leaves her to be raped again by Sound Nin. Let me reiterate once again.\n\nThis man wrote child-on-child rape for cheap drama.\n\nHe gives no reasoning as to why Sasuke is like this, he just is. The moment he learns Hinata is with Naruto, he says he\u2019s gonna rape her. He wines to Orochimaru like a spoiled little boy and it butchers his character to a level I\u2019ve never seen.\n\nSpeaking of Orochimaru, he\u2019s turned into a literal fucking pedophile. You know, that joke that was somewhat funny back in like 2007? It\u2019s treated seriously here. Orochimaru literally has sex with Part 1 Sasuke. None of his intelligence in canon is shown whatsoever. He just lives to fuck Sasuke. And he also wants to rape Tsunade because reasons.\n\nKabuto is the third wheel and doesn\u2019t really do much besides wanting to rape Kurenai because this guy couldn\u2019t write a good villain if you put a gun to his head. They\u2019re always a rapist because writing a villain with nuance is just too much for this guy to do. Gotta make them ultra evil so the audience knows how to feel.\n\nPlot:\n\nYou tell me. The story pretty much came to a halt after the time skip. It\u2019s just one big circlejerk of people congratulation Hinata on being impregnated by and marrying our glorious Naruto-sama. Did I also mention they live in Minato\u2019s secret mansion, that stupid clich\u00e9 that makes no sense because Minato is way too humble to buy a fucking mansion? But whatever, gotta give Naruto some way to learn Flying Thunder God.\n\nAnd before that, it was just poorly done romance between 13-year-olds and pointless drama.\n\nWriting:\n\nThis guy\u2019s writing is so fucking transparent, it hurts. He writes these long paragraphs of fluff that could be condensed down to a couple of sentences. You\u2019ll read an entire paragraph but feel like you\u2019ve read nothing at all.\n\nThis also means the length of the story is kinda a lie as a large majority of it is just fluff. The chapters are long, and I mean long. The first 5 chapters alone has like 15,000 words and the entire fic itself is almost 1 million words, so it\u2019s a struggle to get through.\n\nHe also uses Japanese multiple times, which disrupts the flow of the already bad writing. And the thing is, he translates them in parenthesis right after. So what\u2019s the point of the Japanese? The dialogue used here is absolute shit. I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n\n\"Now the Hyuga bitch, that's another story! I'd like to strap her to a table right now and have her churn out Uchiha's for the next twenty years! Orochimaru Sensei, please oh pretty please, may we go get the Hyuga girl and do just that?\"\n\n\"Hinata may no longer be a hime to you Hyuga, but she'll always be my hime \" Naruto replied with a smile on his face, as Hinata turned beet red and her heart melted at Naruto's sweet words of affection.\"\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know you from somewhere? I know where I\u2019ve seen you before, you\u2019re one of the whorekage\u2019s Jounin aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPlease end me.\n\nRomace:\n\nEasily the worst aspect of this fic. Naruto and Hinata get together in like one chapter, with Hinata acting extremely OOC character and just confessing to Naruto on the spot. And of course, Naruto realizes he loves her (despite them almost never interacting before this) and they start dating. Because that\u2019s obviously what I came to see; two twelve-year olds kissing and shit. He also has couples give each other pet names like \u201cNaru-kun\u201d and \u201cHime\u201d, or Kurenai calling Kakashi \u201cKashi-kun\u201d and it makes me want to put a bullet through my head.\n\nAnd the sex scenes are fucking atrocious. Stop reading this right now, go to Chapter 61, and read it for yourself.\n\nAre you back? That shit was trash wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s literally every hentai you\u2019ve seen, but in written form. This sound like how a 14 year old thinks sex works.\n\nThe author also has a habit of making people antagonistic out of nowhere to satisfy the ships. He made Asuma an asshole just to satisfy the Kakashi/Kurenai ship. He also made Kiba an asshole so satisfy the NaruHina ship.\n\nA particular example is after everyone found out about Sakura\u2019s rape, Kiba\u2019s reaction is essentially \u201cwelp, she\u2019s ruined. Guess I can\u2019t fuck her now.\u201d\n\nThis is usually a thing writers to when they can\u2019t write romance; just make all potential love interest assholes so we have no choice but to ship the two main characters, because writing realistic romance actually takes effort and can\u2019t just be done on a whim.\n\nBashing:\n\nWouldn\u2019t be a shit story without some good ole bashing.\n\nThe main target, as I\u2019m sure you can guess, is Sakura.\n\nThis dude seems to have a hate boner for her, as she goes through some of the most horrific shit in the story. She\u2019s constantly yelled at and belittled by everyone around her, is raped by her teammate and a group of grown men and is further belittled. Her behavior from before is heavily flanderized. Apparently she\u2019s verbally/physically abused Naruto in the past and never liked him.\n\nWhich is false. All the times she hits him is played for laughs and is nothing more than comedy. Not to mention it barely happens in the manga; the anime just played it up for filler. And the \u201cverbal abuse\u201d is literally just her calling Naruto an idiot sometimes, which is true.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Sakura\u2019s character, that\u2019s fine. But writing her being gangraped as a child is just atrocious.\n\nKakashi\u2019s bashed somewhat as well because he favored Sasuke apparently, despite the fact he never did. The only time he did was when he fought Gaara, and Sasuke needed it because Gaara could tank a Hidden Lotus from 5 Gates Lee, couldn\u2019t be touched unless you had faster-than-sight speed, was a Jinchuriki, and killed almost everyone he fights. Sasuke was fighting for his life, not Naruto. Not to mention he got Ebisu, who is said to be an elite trainer, to train Naruto. He\u2019s also mad Naruto didn\u2019t get Chidori, despite the fact you need a Sharingan to counteract the tunnel vision. He also claims Kakashi never liked Naruto, despite Kakashi saving them against Zabuza and the Demon Brothers.\n\nBut nope, gotta keep with the narrative that everyone\u2019s against Naruto\n\nSasuke\u2019s bashed, too, but I feel I don\u2019t have to explain any further.\n\nThere\u2019s more, but I don\u2019t feel like explaining, so I\u2019ll just list them:\n\nEvil Hiashi, Evil Sakura\u2019s mom, Evil Civilian Council, Evil Civilians, etc. Basically, everyone who doesn\u2019t suck off Naruto is bashed.\n\nPower scaling:\n\nAnd the final punch to the teeth is a power wank. Jiraiya is one-shotted by Part 1 Naruto using a little of Kurama\u2019s chakra, Hinata beats Mangekyo Sharingan Sasuke, and Tsunade can clap Orochimaru, who was able to keep up with her despite having no working arms.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis story is a pile of shit and is a prime example of how reviews don\u2019t always equal story quality. I usually try not to judge what people read; everyone\u2019s tastes are different. However, I refuse to accept that anyone could like this fic unless they\u2019re like 12. It\u2019s the bottom barrel of this community and I will always loathe its existence",

IIRC the fics had the explanation that they would want the Byakugan to be introduced in the kage's bloodline because 1. he's the kage and 2. because the Raikage's family has superhuman body genetics and they also specialize in taijutsu, so the Byakugan would boost that greately.",

Even genius children are still emotionally children and not capable of making responsible adult decisions. That's why it's still statutory rape if an adult sleeps with a minor, regardless of whether or not a kid is a genius. And why even genius children are still not allowed to sign legally binding agreements. Or why a genius 14 year old that slaughters his family after some creep in authority coerces him into doing it by holding his baby brother's life hostage wouldn't be charged as an adult.\n\nThe adults around him saying, \"Itachi was big brain hokage child hurr hurr\" is just them trying to push their guilt and responsibility for what happened off on a kid, when it was the adult's fault all that shit happened in the first place. \n\nHiruzen definitely is responsible in part due to his inaction and incompetent leadership, but he and the fire daimyo did not orchestrate the slaughter. That was all on Danzo. In fact, Hiruzen was so pissed by it actually happening that is what caused him to force an official break up of ROOT.",

            "body": "It has one of the most famous reviews on reddit, and is the most infamous fanfic of all time.\n\nCredit to u/The_Real_DirtyDan01 for writing this up recently, whose points I wholeheartedly agree with:\n\nNaruto vs Sasuke: The Aftermath.\n\nI can say with 100% confidence that this is one of, if not the worst Naruto fanfic on this site. Imagine a fic with every clich\u00e9 that this subreddit hates and is shoved into a story that attempts to take them seriously. Now take that and multiply it by 10 and you\u2019ll start to feel the pain I felt when I first read this train wreck back in my early days. It starts off after the VOTE fight at the end of Part 1 before going downhill.\n\nCharacters:\n\nEvery character in this fic is nothing more than a plot device to further praise Naruto. Many are inaccurately portrayed to make him look better and suck him off more than TenTen did Neji during the Chunin Exams.\n\nOne particular example is with Lee. Apparently, sometime after the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Lee attempted suicide. I don\u2019t really remember why, but it\u2019s not that important to the topic. So everyone wonders where tf Lee has been for the past few days. Naruto sneaks into the hospital at night to meet up with Lee, only to find out he\u2019s been put under suicide watch. This has caused a falling out between Lee and Gai, as Gai is disappointed he would try to extinguish his flames of youth\n\nNow, this could\u2019ve been an interesting way to take Lee\u2019s character, as most fics don\u2019t really do much with his character beyond canon. But instead of taking that chance, the author instead turns Lee\u2019s attempted suicide about Naruto. While they\u2019re talking, Lee then made the biggest mistake of his life; he said Naruto wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\nThis of course triggered Naruto\u2019s tragic backstory, with the author seemingly forgetting this was about Lee and going on a long tirade about how Naruto tried to kill himself, his happy attitude was an emotional mask, his team hates him; you know, the typical flanderization of Naruto\u2019s childhood to make us \u2018sympathize\u2019 with him more.\n\nYes, this dude made Lee\u2019s suicide more about Naruto then Lee. It\u2019s a prime example of how everything revolves around Naruto. And then Lee is no longer sad because our savior Naruto made his suicidal tendencies and depression go away with that typical charm of his. Because that\u2019s how mental health works apparently.\n\nHowever, the worst was with the \u2018villains\u2019.\n\nThis dude turned Sasuke into a rapist sociopathic monster. There\u2019s an entire chapter spent with Part 1 Sasuke raping Part 1 Sakura in detail. He then pisses on her and leaves her to be raped again by Sound Nin. Let me reiterate once again.\n\nThis man wrote child-on-child rape for cheap drama.\n\nHe gives no reasoning as to why Sasuke is like this, he just is. The moment he learns Hinata is with Naruto, he says he\u2019s gonna rape her. He wines to Orochimaru like a spoiled little boy and it butchers his character to a level I\u2019ve never seen.\n\nSpeaking of Orochimaru, he\u2019s turned into a literal fucking pedophile. You know, that joke that was somewhat funny back in like 2007? It\u2019s treated seriously here. Orochimaru literally has sex with Part 1 Sasuke. None of his intelligence in canon is shown whatsoever. He just lives to fuck Sasuke. And he also wants to rape Tsunade because reasons.\n\nKabuto is the third wheel and doesn\u2019t really do much besides wanting to rape Kurenai because this guy couldn\u2019t write a good villain if you put a gun to his head. They\u2019re always a rapist because writing a villain with nuance is just too much for this guy to do. Gotta make them ultra evil so the audience knows how to feel.\n\nPlot:\n\nYou tell me. The story pretty much came to a halt after the time skip. It\u2019s just one big circlejerk of people congratulation Hinata on being impregnated by and marrying our glorious Naruto-sama. Did I also mention they live in Minato\u2019s secret mansion, that stupid clich\u00e9 that makes no sense because Minato is way too humble to buy a fucking mansion? But whatever, gotta give Naruto some way to learn Flying Thunder God.\n\nAnd before that, it was just poorly done romance between 13-year-olds and pointless drama.\n\nWriting:\n\nThis guy\u2019s writing is so fucking transparent, it hurts. He writes these long paragraphs of fluff that could be condensed down to a couple of sentences. You\u2019ll read an entire paragraph but feel like you\u2019ve read nothing at all.\n\nThis also means the length of the story is kinda a lie as a large majority of it is just fluff. The chapters are long, and I mean long. The first 5 chapters alone has like 15,000 words and the entire fic itself is almost 1 million words, so it\u2019s a struggle to get through.\n\nHe also uses Japanese multiple times, which disrupts the flow of the already bad writing. And the thing is, he translates them in parenthesis right after. So what\u2019s the point of the Japanese? The dialogue used here is absolute shit. I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n\n\"Now the Hyuga bitch, that's another story! I'd like to strap her to a table right now and have her churn out Uchiha's for the next twenty years! Orochimaru Sensei, please oh pretty please, may we go get the Hyuga girl and do just that?\"\n\n\"Hinata may no longer be a hime to you Hyuga, but she'll always be my hime \" Naruto replied with a smile on his face, as Hinata turned beet red and her heart melted at Naruto's sweet words of affection.\"\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know you from somewhere? I know where I\u2019ve seen you before, you\u2019re one of the whorekage\u2019s Jounin aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPlease end me.\n\nRomace:\n\nEasily the worst aspect of this fic. Naruto and Hinata get together in like one chapter, with Hinata acting extremely OOC character and just confessing to Naruto on the spot. And of course, Naruto realizes he loves her (despite them almost never interacting before this) and they start dating. Because that\u2019s obviously what I came to see; two twelve-year olds kissing and shit. He also has couples give each other pet names like \u201cNaru-kun\u201d and \u201cHime\u201d, or Kurenai calling Kakashi \u201cKashi-kun\u201d and it makes me want to put a bullet through my head.\n\nAnd the sex scenes are fucking atrocious. Stop reading this right now, go to Chapter 61, and read it for yourself.\n\nAre you back? That shit was trash wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s literally every hentai you\u2019ve seen, but in written form. This sound like how a 14 year old thinks sex works.\n\nThe author also has a habit of making people antagonistic out of nowhere to satisfy the ships. He made Asuma an asshole just to satisfy the Kakashi/Kurenai ship. He also made Kiba an asshole so satisfy the NaruHina ship.\n\nA particular example is after everyone found out about Sakura\u2019s rape, Kiba\u2019s reaction is essentially \u201cwelp, she\u2019s ruined. Guess I can\u2019t fuck her now.\u201d\n\nThis is usually a thing writers to when they can\u2019t write romance; just make all potential love interest assholes so we have no choice but to ship the two main characters, because writing realistic romance actually takes effort and can\u2019t just be done on a whim.\n\nBashing:\n\nWouldn\u2019t be a shit story without some good ole bashing.\n\nThe main target, as I\u2019m sure you can guess, is Sakura.\n\nThis dude seems to have a hate boner for her, as she goes through some of the most horrific shit in the story. She\u2019s constantly yelled at and belittled by everyone around her, is raped by her teammate and a group of grown men and is further belittled. Her behavior from before is heavily flanderized. Apparently she\u2019s verbally/physically abused Naruto in the past and never liked him.\n\nWhich is false. All the times she hits him is played for laughs and is nothing more than comedy. Not to mention it barely happens in the manga; the anime just played it up for filler. And the \u201cverbal abuse\u201d is literally just her calling Naruto an idiot sometimes, which is true.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Sakura\u2019s character, that\u2019s fine. But writing her being gangraped as a child is just atrocious.\n\nKakashi\u2019s bashed somewhat as well because he favored Sasuke apparently, despite the fact he never did. The only time he did was when he fought Gaara, and Sasuke needed it because Gaara could tank a Hidden Lotus from 5 Gates Lee, couldn\u2019t be touched unless you had faster-than-sight speed, was a Jinchuriki, and killed almost everyone he fights. Sasuke was fighting for his life, not Naruto. Not to mention he got Ebisu, who is said to be an elite trainer, to train Naruto. He\u2019s also mad Naruto didn\u2019t get Chidori, despite the fact you need a Sharingan to counteract the tunnel vision. He also claims Kakashi never liked Naruto, despite Kakashi saving them against Zabuza and the Demon Brothers.\n\nBut nope, gotta keep with the narrative that everyone\u2019s against Naruto\n\nSasuke\u2019s bashed, too, but I feel I don\u2019t have to explain any further.\n\nThere\u2019s more, but I don\u2019t feel like explaining, so I\u2019ll just list them:\n\nEvil Hiashi, Evil Sakura\u2019s mom, Evil Civilian Council, Evil Civilians, etc. Basically, everyone who doesn\u2019t suck off Naruto is bashed.\n\nPower scaling:\n\nAnd the final punch to the teeth is a power wank. Jiraiya is one-shotted by Part 1 Naruto using a little of Kurama\u2019s chakra, Hinata beats Mangekyo Sharingan Sasuke, and Tsunade can clap Orochimaru, who was able to keep up with her despite having no working arms.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis story is a pile of shit and is a prime example of how reviews don\u2019t always equal story quality. I usually try not to judge what people read; everyone\u2019s tastes are different. However, I refuse to accept that anyone could like this fic unless they\u2019re like 12. It\u2019s the bottom barrel of this community and I will always loathe its existence",

Or why a genius 14 year old that slaughters his family after some creep in authority coerces him into doing it by holding his baby brother's life hostage wouldn't be charged as an adult.\n\nThe adults around him saying, \"Itachi was big brain hokage child hurr hurr\" is just them trying to push their guilt and responsibility for what happened off on a kid, when it was the adult's fault all that shit happened in the first place. \n\nHiruzen definitely is responsible in part due to his inaction and incompetent leadership, but he and the fire daimyo did not orchestrate the slaughter.

Or why a genius 14 year old that slaughters his family after some creep in authority coerces him into doing it by holding his baby brother's life hostage wouldn't be charged as an adult.\n\nThe adults around him saying, \"Itachi was big brain hokage child hurr hurr\" is just them trying to push their guilt and responsibility for what happened off on a kid, when it was the adult's fault all that shit happened in the first place. \n\nHiruzen definitely is responsible in part due to his inaction and incompetent leadership, but he and the fire daimyo did not orchestrate the slaughter.

Or why a genius 14 year old that slaughters his family after some creep in authority coerces him into doing it by holding his baby brother's life hostage wouldn't be charged as an adult.\n\nThe adults around him saying, \"Itachi was big brain hokage child hurr hurr\" is just them trying to push their guilt and responsibility for what happened off on a kid, when it was the adult's fault all that shit happened in the first place. \n\nHiruzen definitely is responsible in part due to his inaction and incompetent leadership, but he and the fire daimyo did not orchestrate the slaughter. That was all on Danzo. In fact, Hiruzen was so pissed by it actually happening that is what caused him to force an official break up of ROOT.",

That's why it's still statutory rape if an adult sleeps with a minor, regardless of whether or not a kid is a genius. And why even genius children are still not allowed to sign legally binding agreements. Or why a genius 14 year old that slaughters his family after some creep in authority coerces him into doing it by holding his baby brother's life hostage wouldn't be charged as an adult.\n\nThe adults around him saying, \"Itachi was big brain hokage child hurr hurr\" is just them trying to push their guilt and responsibility for what happened off on a kid, when it was the adult's fault all that shit happened in the first place. \n\nHiruzen definitely is responsible in part due to his inaction and incompetent leadership, but he and the fire daimyo did not orchestrate the slaughter. That was all on Danzo. In fact, Hiruzen was so pissed by it actually happening that is what caused him to force an official break up of ROOT.",
