    "body": "There's a profile of a couple. Now, this is not new. What is new about this one is that they are very clear that they want a platonic relationship with an SD who will fund both of their education while they are pursuing their masters. Where the hell are these people coming from? SA really needs to start screening new members or something. I thought I had seen it all when a 35 year old woman asked on her profile to \"prove\" the seriousness of an SD by asking for a $1.5 million house.\n\nIt would seem that new profiles never ceases to amaze me. I wonder what I'll be surprised by next.",

Then after I went from weekly M&Gs to none since last April, they had the gall to raise prices in January, as well as drop single-month memberships that don't auto-renew. Then they started their own scam/fraud--I got a scary-looking email from them saying my credit card had been declined, which had a link to renewing premium membership, trying to trick me. I also have a suspicion that they  have a group of fake profiles that message men after their premium membership expires, trying to get them to pay up out of curiosity--it's happened to me several times, sometimes with the same girls (who of course never respond to follow-ups and then disappear for months).",
