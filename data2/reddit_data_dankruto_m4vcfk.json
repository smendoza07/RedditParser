(Best girl, fite me)\n\nThe Nine Tails breaking out of Chibaku Tensei and staring down at Pain.\n\nMinato showing up out of nowhere like, \"Ay! Yo, I'm your pops. Sorry, gotta go. Kick that guys ass.\"\n\nAnd the resurrection scene.\n\nAbsolute masterpiece.",

Not only that, he\u2019s the hyped up **leader** of the even more hyped up organization of S-class terrorists, one of which is a dude who slaughtered his entire clan as a 7th grader and another of which is a literal shark man. Not to mention we just saw said leader straight up fondle one of the strongest people we\u2019ve encountered in the series up to that point in Jiraiya.\n\nStanding across from him is the dude who has a bit of a bone to pick with the leader that \u201ckilled my master and my sensei, hurt my friends, and destroyed my village\u201d, as well as fundamentally shattering his perception of justice and peace, and then indiscriminately stabbing the chick who just professed her desire to fuck him. This got him angry enough to unleash his demonic fursona in front of what remained of his village.\n\nImo, the resulting fight between these two forces deserved nothing less than the fast-paced, frenetic, comically insane looney tunes display of raw power and ferocity that we were given",

Not to mention we just saw said leader straight up fondle one of the strongest people we\u2019ve encountered in the series up to that point in Jiraiya.\n\nStanding across from him is the dude who has a bit of a bone to pick with the leader that \u201ckilled my master and my sensei, hurt my friends, and destroyed my village\u201d, as well as fundamentally shattering his perception of justice and peace, and then indiscriminately stabbing the chick who just professed her desire to fuck him. This got him angry enough to unleash his demonic fursona in front of what remained of his village.\n\nImo, the resulting fight between these two forces deserved nothing less than the fast-paced, frenetic, comically insane looney tunes display of raw power and ferocity that we were given",
