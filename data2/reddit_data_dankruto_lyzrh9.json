Sasukes dad had quite a big support group outside the clan and was more popular than orochimaru and has great leadership skils, shikamarus dad had the brains for it and tsunade has a little of both brains and god enough leadership skills, i would have been fine with either one of them becoming hokage.",

He was a great Kage before Minato though, as it was under his leadership that Konoha survived the 3rd Ninja War and how the village was successful against other villages, especially when he put Minato on the main line of defence. He also avoided a war with the Hidden Mist, though it cost him Neji's father.",

Obito was an orphan too but his grandmother took care of him. No one hated Naruto until Danzo leaked that he was the new jinchuriki. Very few people knew Kushina was a jinchuriki either since that was top secret after all.\n\nAnd it's not like Minato and Kushina didn't have friends who could help. Shikaku for example, was the Jonin commander so he must have known Minato well.",

No need to make up bs. I literally linked a panel that said Danzo pushed the Uchiha out and the distrust began and you keep repeating your lies.\n\nIt was explained Tobirama [gave them the position so they can channel their emotion into productive](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvGjmOLWYAA3aTg?format=jpg&name=small) It was literally public sign of trust and [made the Uchiha the elite and privileged shinobi.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvGjm1pWgAQUQGf?format=jpg&name=small) Tobiaa made the Uchiha influential. He wouldn't have offered such an unimportant position if he thought them all evil. Also Uchiha could have refused this position if they had wanted to but they accepted and monopolised law enforcement over the years. \n\nYour entire argument is not only against canon but defies common sense as well.",

Sasukes dad had quite a big support group outside the clan and was more popular than orochimaru and has great leadership skils, shikamarus dad had the brains for it and tsunade has a little of both brains and god enough leadership skills, i would have been fine with either one of them becoming hokage.",

Sasukes dad had quite a big support group outside the clan and was more popular than orochimaru and has great leadership skils, shikamarus dad had the brains for it and tsunade has a little of both brains and god enough leadership skills, i would have been fine with either one of them becoming hokage.",

There's a massive gulf between a mentor and a father figure. Although to be fair he wasn't winning any father of the year awards with his bio children, so this probably really was his best.",

Sasukes dad had quite a big support group outside the clan and was more popular than orochimaru and has great leadership skils, shikamarus dad had the brains for it and tsunade has a little of both brains and god enough leadership skills, i would have been fine with either one of them becoming hokage.",

There's a massive gulf between a mentor and a father figure. Although to be fair he wasn't winning any father of the year awards with his bio children, so this probably really was his best.",

Sasukes dad had quite a big support group outside the clan and was more popular than orochimaru and has great leadership skils, shikamarus dad had the brains for it and tsunade has a little of both brains and god enough leadership skills, i would have been fine with either one of them becoming hokage.",

The Uchihas felt like they were being spied on by Tobirama and that they can't be trusted. Hashirama has warned him to not antagonise the Uchihas, but Tobirama didn't listen, and even calls them evil. Maybe you should watch before commenting",

He wouldn't have offered such an unimportant position if he thought them all evil. Also Uchiha could have refused this position if they had wanted to but they accepted and monopolised law enforcement over the years. \n\nYour entire argument is not only against canon but defies common sense as well.",

I literally linked a panel that said Danzo pushed the Uchiha out and the distrust began and you keep repeating your lies.\n\nIt was explained Tobirama [gave them the position so they can channel their emotion into productive](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvGjmOLWYAA3aTg?format=jpg&name=small) It was literally public sign of trust and [made the Uchiha the elite and privileged shinobi.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvGjm1pWgAQUQGf?format=jpg&name=small) Tobiaa made the Uchiha influential. He wouldn't have offered such an unimportant position if he thought them all evil. Also Uchiha could have refused this position if they had wanted to but they accepted and monopolised law enforcement over the years. \n\nYour entire argument is not only against canon but defies common sense as well.",
