    "body": "Sitting around at her place a couple of days ago, chatting and drinking some wine.  Jumps up, while saying \u201cI almost forgot\u201d.  Then she brings out this bracelet she made.  We have this thing where we call each other by our initials.  Or she will say something about heading to a new city - \u201cWe\u2019re xx and yy - that place will never be the same!\u201d\n\nThe bracelet had our initials in it.  Sounds like she had it fall apart a few times while making it.  She finally got it all done, and one of her letters is put in backwards.  When she saw that she said \u201cf*** it, not starting over\u201d. \n\nAnyway, I found all of this adorable.  Guess I am easy to make happy, right?\n\nShe has been telling me for months now, that she is making something for me, and that it could make me cry when she finally gets it done.  Wondering what she is up to.",

Part of the territory is being taken for granted, because we are seen to be so fortunate and/or well off.  We just accept it as normal.\n\nSo when someone enters your life who shows appreciation and is thoughtful towards you, it is seriously impactful, because it so rare.",

But somehow we just meshed over time.\n\nsame as my SGF. Very deep and complex personality, but I was intrigued from the 1st day I met her. I even decided to see her again against my better judgment because she didnt even give me a kiss at the end of the meet and greet and things got all awkward for me. Ive never had any success having a SR with someone who didnt at least kiss me the 1st time we met. Usually would go on a 2nd date and there was still no kiss, so at some point just decided I would never give girls like that a 2nd chance to waste my money. But something told me to break my own rules. We've been together over 7 months now & going strong. She also does stuff like what your SB does and makes things for me that are personalized & then makes her own cards too.",
