It seems to bring out a different side of them that isn\u2019t seen in the show. \n\nJihyo gets to be more involved while Sechan doesn\u2019t get the shadow of his seniors over him. \n\nAs long as they don\u2019t slap a stupid love line on them I think it could be a great path that isn\u2019t fully explored yet. I thoroughly enjoyed their dynamic on the 9th anniversary project.",

All of them are the very best in variety show. As such yjs give ysc a role of a \"common man\" haha.. which suits him. And he has been great ever since haha..",
