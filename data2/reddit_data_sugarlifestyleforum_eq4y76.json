    "body": "I'm not sure if I'm breaking any rules but I just really have to talk about it. To me, nothing is sexier than having a handsome well off gentleman hand me a stack of bills before doing dirty things to me. It makes me feel sexy and desirable and oh so dirty in all the right ways. I know it makes me sound not great and kind of like a gold digger but damn it makes me want to take my clothes off.",

Many SBs feel relatively powerless in their everyday lives, especially since many perform relatively menial jobs. Women are also used to be dominated and controlled by men. So, the money makes them feel powerful, that they are in control. It also makes them feel more worthy.\n\nHowever, the dynamic can easily be flipped around, where the SD uses money to exercise power and and control. He can use to demean women. So, it can really go either way, depending on the circumstances of the situation.",
