He would\u2019ve absolutely mopped the floor with sasuke at that time 10 times out of 10. People severely underestimate how powerful kakashi really is, especially at that time in the 5 kage summit which was after pain arc where kakashi almost killed the 2 most powerful paths with a little bit of help even coming in blind. He\u2019s probably kage to high kage level at that point \n\nEdit: typo",
