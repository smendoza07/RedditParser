First of all Naruto didn't literally KO/defeat Kurama in a fight, he PUSHED HIM AWAY A BIT allowing him to win the tug-o-war, and that was HALF of Kurama's power, as the other half was sealed in Minato. Secondly, Minato's sage mode was way less complete than Naruto's, and he could never make the chakra expenditures that Naruto did. Those aren't just from sage mode, he's got Uzumaki chakra and has higher chakra levels simply from having kurama sealed in him as a little bit of kurama's chakra escapes the seal and fuses with Naruto's. \n\nThis was explained back when he was 12, back when it was explained that **Naruto had 4x Kakashi's chakra, we're talking about his own chakra reserves without counting Kurama's chakra.**\n\nBut yes who knows, maybe Minato could straight up kill Kurama in his own way, and leave his family unprotected while a FUCKING MASKED MADARA-LEVEL CUNT WHO SUMMONED THE KYUBI AND HAS A CRAZY MASTERPLAN was roaming around the village. Wouldn't that be a great dad.\n\nMeanwhile the kyubi is gone, yay. Oh hey all the villages found out Konoha doesn't have the kyubi anymore. Oh look everyone's attacking us. Oh look we're all dead.

Secondly, Minato's sage mode was way less complete than Naruto's, and he could never make the chakra expenditures that Naruto did. Those aren't just from sage mode, he's got Uzumaki chakra and has higher chakra levels simply from having kurama sealed in him as a little bit of kurama's chakra escapes the seal and fuses with Naruto's. \n\nThis was explained back when he was 12, back when it was explained that **Naruto had 4x Kakashi's chakra, we're talking about his own chakra reserves without counting Kurama's chakra.**\n\nBut yes who knows, maybe Minato could straight up kill Kurama in his own way, and leave his family unprotected while a FUCKING MASKED MADARA-LEVEL CUNT WHO SUMMONED THE KYUBI AND HAS A CRAZY MASTERPLAN was roaming around the village.

First of all Naruto didn't literally KO/defeat Kurama in a fight, he PUSHED HIM AWAY A BIT allowing him to win the tug-o-war, and that was HALF of Kurama's power, as the other half was sealed in Minato. Secondly, Minato's sage mode was way less complete than Naruto's, and he could never make the chakra expenditures that Naruto did. Those aren't just from sage mode, he's got Uzumaki chakra and has higher chakra levels simply from having kurama sealed in him as a little bit of kurama's chakra escapes the seal and fuses with Naruto's. \n\nThis was explained back when he was 12, back when it was explained that **Naruto had 4x Kakashi's chakra, we're talking about his own chakra reserves without counting Kurama's chakra.**\n\nBut yes who knows, maybe Minato could straight up kill Kurama in his own way, and leave his family unprotected while a FUCKING MASKED MADARA-LEVEL CUNT WHO SUMMONED THE KYUBI AND HAS A CRAZY MASTERPLAN was roaming around the village. Wouldn't that be a great dad.\n\nMeanwhile the kyubi is gone, yay. Oh hey all the villages found out Konoha doesn't have the kyubi anymore. Oh look everyone's attacking us. Oh look we're all dead.

First of all Naruto didn't literally KO/defeat Kurama in a fight, he PUSHED HIM AWAY A BIT allowing him to win the tug-o-war, and that was HALF of Kurama's power, as the other half was sealed in Minato. Secondly, Minato's sage mode was way less complete than Naruto's, and he could never make the chakra expenditures that Naruto did. Those aren't just from sage mode, he's got Uzumaki chakra and has higher chakra levels simply from having kurama sealed in him as a little bit of kurama's chakra escapes the seal and fuses with Naruto's. \n\nThis was explained back when he was 12, back when it was explained that **Naruto had 4x Kakashi's chakra, we're talking about his own chakra reserves without counting Kurama's chakra.**\n\nBut yes who knows, maybe Minato could straight up kill Kurama in his own way, and leave his family unprotected while a FUCKING MASKED MADARA-LEVEL CUNT WHO SUMMONED THE KYUBI AND HAS A CRAZY MASTERPLAN was roaming around the village. Wouldn't that be a great dad.\n\nMeanwhile the kyubi is gone, yay. Oh hey all the villages found out Konoha doesn't have the kyubi anymore. Oh look everyone's attacking us. Oh look we're all dead.

Keep the Kyuubi in the village, C. Have someone be strong enough to beat \"Madara\" long after he's dead (Obviously to Minato's Knowledge, so you cant pull shit like \"eIghT GAtes gUy)\n\n> Yet he really didn't. He took any easy option that had more potential failures than any other option he could have taken.\n\nAh yes, its so easy to Teleport the Kyuubi several times, beat \"Madara\",  perform a reaper death seal and burden you're son with the nine tails and allow him to live with no parents. Also all of this happened RIGHT after his wife just gave birth, who knows how fucked his mental state have been right then.\n\nSo in conclusion, you somehow managed to get all your points wrong.",

He took any easy option that had more potential failures than any other option he could have taken. \n\nAlright, name one option that could A. Seal the Nine Tails, B. Keep the Kyuubi in the village, C. Have someone be strong enough to beat \"Madara\" long after he's dead (Obviously to Minato's Knowledge, so you cant pull shit like \"eIghT GAtes gUy)\n\n> Yet he really didn't. He took any easy option that had more potential failures than any other option he could have taken.\n\nAh yes, its so easy to Teleport the Kyuubi several times, beat \"Madara\",  perform a reaper death seal and burden you're son with the nine tails and allow him to live with no parents. Also all of this happened RIGHT after his wife just gave birth, who knows how fucked his mental state have been right then.\n\nSo in conclusion, you somehow managed to get all your points wrong.",

Have someone be strong enough to beat \"Madara\" long after he's dead (Obviously to Minato's Knowledge, so you cant pull shit like \"eIghT GAtes gUy)\n\n> Yet he really didn't. He took any easy option that had more potential failures than any other option he could have taken.\n\nAh yes, its so easy to Teleport the Kyuubi several times, beat \"Madara\",  perform a reaper death seal and burden you're son with the nine tails and allow him to live with no parents. Also all of this happened RIGHT after his wife just gave birth, who knows how fucked his mental state have been right then.\n\nSo in conclusion, you somehow managed to get all your points wrong.",
