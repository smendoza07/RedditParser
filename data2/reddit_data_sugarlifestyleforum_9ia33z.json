    "body": "Hello there. I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and just wanted to recount something that happened to me recently - perhaps as a safety PSA to all other SBs out there.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm not particularly new to the bowl. I had one long-term SR previously. I understand that there are certain precautions one should take when going on meet-and-greets and I am particularly careful. I think I'm pretty street smart - I'm in my late 20s, live in NYC, and have lived in several other large cities. I always to tell a friend where I am going and for how long, as well as share my location on my phone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell anyway, about a month and a half ago, I was sitting at the bar of a restaurant by myself when a very handsome, older gentleman approached me. (I love taking myself out to dinner haha). We chatted a bit and he mentioned that he was \"looking for an arrangement\". I was pretty excited to have met him - I had never free-styled before and wasn't even trying to find a SD. We exchanged numbers (I gave him my Google Voice number) and sent many messages over the next few weeks. It sounded like we were both looking for the same things and he offered me a very generous allowance.  We made plans to meet up at a popular bar in Midtown. I was excited!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I show up and he greets me warmly and we find a booth to sit at. We order a few drinks and at first, things seem to be going very well. We have many things in common, so it was quite easy to converse. We talked about sports, music, our recent travels, and the sort of food we liked to eat - all of my favorite things. I was certainly enjoying our time together. In my head, I was thinking about how he'd be a great SD. Then of course, things turned for the worse.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe casually mentions his fascination with \"exotic girls\". That is a huge red flag for me, sugar or vanilla. He goes on to say how he always likes to have a Chinese or Japanese girl by his side, but wouldn't mind making an exception for me, an \"above average Korean\" who has \"decent taste in clothes and seems mildly talented with a makeup brush\". Jeez thanks, lovely compliments. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I obviously know that this is not the SD for me. What a jackass. I politely try to start wrapping things up (still have traces of that \"Midwest nice\", unfortunately). Meanwhile he starts going down this path, telling me about how he likes to degrade girls in the bedroom, loves rape play, loves to choke, wants to be called \"daddy\", etc. I am feeling extremely uneasy and excuse myself to go to the restroom.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm sort of panicking at this point (my natural reaction) and so on my way to the restroom, I stop a hostess and tell her about how I'm on a bad date and that I wouldn't mind having security or a manager keep an eye on me when I go to leave. She is totally understanding and asks if I'd like to be led out the back door right then and there. I would have, but I stupidly left my bag at the table and I needed the keys to my apartment. She says \"no worries\" and would have security watch me as I go collect my things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI walked back to the table, grabbed my bag, and said \"It was nice to meet you, but I'm sorry, I'm not interested in continuing on. Have a nice night\". He starts telling me about what an \"ungrateful slut I am\" because I should at least stay to finish my drink... Absolutely not. I make a dash to the foyer of the bar and thank the hostess for helping me out. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI walk outside to get a cab to go home. I had just opened the door and was about to step in when someone grabbed my shoulder and jerked me so hard that I fell to the ground. I look up and it's this freaking POT. He starts DRAGGING me to another cab (he's quite a bit taller/bigger than me) by my wrist, then starts pushing me, and yells at me to get in and says he's \"going to punish me for humiliating\" him. I'm in such shock at this point that I can't do or say anything but try to resist.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLuckily, 2 bystanders and a security guard run to the car, push POT aside, and the security guard picks me up and carries me inside. I have no idea what else happened (I sort of blacked out) and when I come back to Earth, I'm sitting in the manager's office with the hostess and 2 police officers and I don't know what to do except cry. The cops asked me a ton of a questions about him - of course, I didn't know that much.  Apparently after the security guard came to my rescue, the POT managed to get away on foot.  The bar has cameras, which caught the whole incident, but I don't know what will come of it or whether he'll be identified.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm still a bit shaken up by the experience. At the time, I thought it was a little dramatic to tell the hostess about what was happening, but I am so glad that I did. Who knows what could have happened otherwise. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSBs, be freaking careful out there. Trust your instincts and if you are feeling unsafe, get yourself out of that situation.",

It sounds like SA may have been one of the sources in addition to the OC bars, freestylers and other web sites. \n\nApparently there are a large number of women on the many tapes seized from the doc's home and obtained under court order from Apple.\n\nThe article was written after after the arrests and probably before the doc's computer was searched.  \n\nhttps://www.ocregister.com/2018/09/18/newport-beach-surgeon-who-appeared-on-bravo-reality-show-and-his-girlfriend-accused-of-raping-2-women/\n\nI was surprised when my current SB was describing how common date rape drugs are in the Santa Barbara bar scene. There's also the case of cosmetic heir Andrew  Luster who loved to film the rape and degradation of drugged girls from the Santa Barbara area bars.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there for young women including SB's.  \n\nThe young woman who opened the discussion deserves 5 gold stars for the good judgement in asking for help \n",

This guy most likely wasn\u2019t a wealthy benefactor, he had some cash to throw around but if he\u2019s less than ceo level, (and its pretty easy to tell, if you thjnk about it)  then he\u2019s a fraud or what I call a Splenda-Daddy.  These dudes are much, much likelier to physically hurt you. They\u2019re the ones that feel impotent and powerless in their real lives in they want to live out an opposite fantasy, and they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your life paying the expense.\n\nBasic rule if thumb I\u2019ve found to be most helpful in helping me tell the difference:  ask yourself \u201cHow is he speaking to me? Is he asking what I do, what I like; is he talking about his job or his hobbies, where he feels unfulfilled, what he likes about you (physical doesn\u2019t count)?  Is he paying you compliments, making eye contact, actually actively listening and giving feedback?  Is HE TREATING YOU LIKE A POTENTIAL COMPANION, OR IS HE TREATING YOU LIKE A HOOKER?\u201d\n\nIf the first things out if his mouth are sexual, jf he\u2019s lewd and crude, if he interrupts or talks iver you ir dismisses you, if he orders drinks/meals for you without asking, if he shows you nudes of himself or ugh, of him fucking another woman (true disgusting story), is he trying to get too physically close, does he not ask you anything other than sexual questions...all these are huge red flags.\n\nReal sugar daddies know that a woman must ne wooed to be interested.  Real daddies dont want a hooker, they could get one cheaper any time.  Real daddies dont cut to the chase like a horny teenager.  The real ones have class, a better standard of livjng which requires honed manners that are not easily broken out of habit.  They are high ups in companies inpart due to their genteelness and amiability.  They are people pleasers, not abusers.  \n\nIve had the remarkable luck of having one who was vice pres of a five star hotel chain, and two retired military officers from the Pentagon.  Set your standards high, ladies.  Be witty, funny, demure yet teasing.  Keep it light and fun.  Keep it classy.  Do your homework.  Verify info.  And if you get a weird vibe, for gods sake give yourself enough credit to trust your instincts and bolt.  ",

There's also the case of cosmetic heir Andrew  Luster who loved to film the rape and degradation of drugged girls from the Santa Barbara area bars.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there for young women including SB's.  \n\nThe young woman who opened the discussion deserves 5 gold stars for the good judgement in asking for help \n",

This guy most likely wasn\u2019t a wealthy benefactor, he had some cash to throw around but if he\u2019s less than ceo level, (and its pretty easy to tell, if you thjnk about it)  then he\u2019s a fraud or what I call a Splenda-Daddy.  These dudes are much, much likelier to physically hurt you. They\u2019re the ones that feel impotent and powerless in their real lives in they want to live out an opposite fantasy, and they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your life paying the expense.\n\nBasic rule if thumb I\u2019ve found to be most helpful in helping me tell the difference:  ask yourself \u201cHow is he speaking to me? Is he asking what I do, what I like; is he talking about his job or his hobbies, where he feels unfulfilled, what he likes about you (physical doesn\u2019t count)?  Is he paying you compliments, making eye contact, actually actively listening and giving feedback?  Is HE TREATING YOU LIKE A POTENTIAL COMPANION, OR IS HE TREATING YOU LIKE A HOOKER?\u201d\n\nIf the first things out if his mouth are sexual, jf he\u2019s lewd and crude, if he interrupts or talks iver you ir dismisses you, if he orders drinks/meals for you without asking, if he shows you nudes of himself or ugh, of him fucking another woman (true disgusting story), is he trying to get too physically close, does he not ask you anything other than sexual questions...all these are huge red flags.\n\nReal sugar daddies know that a woman must ne wooed to be interested.  Real daddies dont want a hooker, they could get one cheaper any time.  Real daddies dont cut to the chase like a horny teenager.  The real ones have class, a better standard of livjng which requires honed manners that are not easily broken out of habit.  They are high ups in companies inpart due to their genteelness and amiability.  They are people pleasers, not abusers.  \n\nIve had the remarkable luck of having one who was vice pres of a five star hotel chain, and two retired military officers from the Pentagon.  Set your standards high, ladies.  Be witty, funny, demure yet teasing.  Keep it light and fun.  Keep it classy.  Do your homework.  Verify info.  And if you get a weird vibe, for gods sake give yourself enough credit to trust your instincts and bolt.  ",
