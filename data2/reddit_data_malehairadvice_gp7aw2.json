    "body": "Pretty much everyone I know seems horrified at their hair growing longer than a few weeks more than it normally would and are resorting to DIY haircuts that often turn out worse during this situation. Only a few people are actually using this as a time to just let it grow and experiment with different styles. Is longer hair just really not in right now and clean-cut is the only way to go? There have been many times in the past where lots of men went longer or shaggier as a style when there was no quarantine, but now people seem to prefer buzz cuts to that. What's up with that? Although I for one am kind of glad to see the ubiquitous undercut not as prominent anymore. I guess as longer hair goes, you do see some dudes with the bun too.",

Obviously it's extremely hard and takes a ton of research to know exactly what to do to achieve the look I like, but now is a good time to do this stuff cause no one will see my mistakes and all the shops are closed. I do agree though if anyone is interested in testing out long hair, now is the time for that too. I've done that in the past and I much prefer the clean cut look personally, but it's all personal preference I guess",
