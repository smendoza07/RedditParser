    "body": "My SB of eight months just texted that she miscarried this morning and we didn't even know she was pregnant. She has always been on birth control. \n\nShe cancelled our date a few days ago, said she was feeling sick and generally unwell, then she said she also had cramps, we put it down to period pains and  seasonal flu and didn't think much of it at the time. \n\nJust in complete and utter shock. My circumstances don't allow me to go visit her immediately. She is sitting there upset and I am stuck here miles away, just a hopeless situation. \n\nDon't know what I should be doing? I will of course go and see her as soon as she is able to. I would appreciate any advice.",

Especially since this is a sugar relationship and she might not be able to talk to anyone else about it.\n\nTalk to her, respond quickly, listen. If you can't be there in person, get away long enough for a call. You job on the call isn't to fix anything (I know as men we always want to do that), its just to be there for her.\n\nAsk if there is anything you can do. She will probably say nothing, but ask anyway.\n\nCheck in with her once a day and see how she is doing.\n\nYou can't \"fix\" it. But you can make sure she isn't alone.",

Started trying to make me feel guilty for \"neglecting him\" then turned it around that it would make me feel better.

I was on the pill and I didn't notice any changes so it was really disorienting and made me feel alienated from my body.

I can't go to her place because she has housemates. \n\nYou are right, it will be emotional, I hadn't thought of that and maybe I should be better prepared to not be in public place.

It was really hard, she is broken up physically and emotionally and still hasn't had a chance to fully process everything. The first time she realised she was pregnant was when she was holding the dead foetus in her hands. I can't even imagine how  traumatic that must have been. Her healing will take time but she has been checked by Doctors and seems to be following the natural course of recovery after miscarriage. \n\nI have made sure she is comfortable and plan to see her throughout next week. I love her and care about her a lot. Counselling is not a bad idea and I will suggest this to her in a week or two. Will do a follow on Post today or tomorrow.",

She might need further treatment if the bleeding doesn't stop.

I can't go to her place because she has housemates. \n\nYou are right, it will be emotional, I hadn't thought of that and maybe I should be better prepared to not be in public place. Thank you though, all good points that will be helpful tomorrow. I particularly like the idea of her being able to relax in a hotel room and that will be the best option if she is well enough.",
