All this leads to them surviving as Naruto met Haku)\n* Was going to quit the exam for Naruto. Not Sasuke. Not herself. But so Naruto could become Hokage.\n* Saves Naruto when Orochimaru knocks him out and he was falling from a tree (which Kakashi freaked out that Naruto was going to fall from a tree in wave, thus he was in danger).\n* Keeps watch over Naruto/Sasuke while they are knocked out. Is gassed af and keeps the sound trio busy until reinforcement shows up.\n* When Naruto makes fun of Lee, Sakura puts Naruto in his place. This is a smart move because they are weak and could be picked off... Neji was **pissed** when he learned Lee was harmed by the Sound genin (Neji is another character ppl get wrong, like, Neji even thought Naruto was hilarious and only hated on him when he learned Naruto was defending Hinata, his owner).\n* Sakura, upon learning that Kakashi taught her something (she seems as surprised as I was), uses her skills to wake ppl up. She then goes on a suicide mission. A mission against not level appropriate does (again).\n* When Sasuke told her that Naruto saved her, Sakura doesn't think it's impossible or hate on Naruto but gives him a warm smile as Naruto is trying to learn Chidori. \n* Sakura is not a front line fighter, people seem to hold this against her on the retrieval mission... But like, all the monsters of her generation went and they got lucky and still almost died. \n\n===\n\nPart 2 has issues all over the place and I can't hold it against Sakura that she is one of many, many, issues.\n\n===\n\nBut I will say, Sakura is the only one to actually be an apprentice and surpass her master... She went the furthest of the three. All without super alien fate reincarnation to help her.",

In shipudden she had the perfect chance to grow and she did but then Kishimoto made her do something stupid that the people start to dislike her again . My point being the time she said she 'loves' Naruto and then time she tried to kill Sasuke etc . \n\nIn P1 all the things she did were something a team member should do , it's something that any team member would have done . The only good character development I felt was when she was ready to quit the exam for Naruto's sake . Throughout the written exam she was actually amazing (manga not anime , they made her look stupid there again) . She was gaining respect and then she does something like cutting her own hair even though she could have tried stabbing the Kunoichi . \n\nThis one dude here thinks I just absolutely hate Sakura even though I stated many times that the war arc version is just amazing . \n\nI didn't ignore your comment it's just that it didn't show up in my notifications , also not to mention I have replied to so many comments and I am kinda tired of it at this point",

This isn't a female issue, but a combination of the industry and Kishimoto going toward the lowest common denominator because he didn't have time to write. Lots of great ideas, but needs a great editor.",

Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

Any part of a character's story can be talked about at any point of time, no exceptions. \nAnd that's also assuming that it's the only reason (or that's how it sounds when reading defensive replies) people have an issue with her, and that a personal grudge would form only over that. \n\nAt least, when it comes that specific scene, else the assumptions shift to many things like lack in power, lack in body or real life slander like \"you got rejected/you're misogynistic \n\", etc. Funny you mention judging ragging on a fictional 12yo for unfounded reasons when lately, many are running with the idea that Naruto tried to sexually assault her by impersonating Sasuke when he was only there to get her opinion on himself and then she tried to kiss \"Sasuke\". \nNot saying that you did (to my knowledge, not in that section for sure, and I hope not), but many of the defenders aren't much better than the detractors on that one, since they're straight up making things up to make her look like the better person in that interaction.",

She got a taste, hated it, and began being better to him. And of course I can\u2019t prove anyone else said something bc they didn\u2019t literally do it, but the context of Naruto being bullied and rejected by everyone implies that everyone used to say and do horrible things to him and -again- they chose to show this behavior with Sakura.",

Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that.

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

That's treating him badly, but on wildly different matters (and Kiba acknowledged\nNaruto's value after he managed to beat him). Everyone shown dissing him in the background does so on the basis that he's the Fox or its host, and that he's a failure in general, but no one specifically said he sucks because he has no parents, not even Mizuki, I think.\n\nOh, and I doubt most people are specifically hung up about only the 3rd episode, it's only part of the issue, and I don't care that much about her to begin with (not for you OP, but to whoever would jump to say that I'm obsessing about that to defend her, because it's an automatic response to everyone criticizing that scene, followed by a \"what about...\" segment as you can see here).",

Tailing constantly, keeping tabs on said person, and especially with nefarious intent or distorted feelings, in the other hand, does (cases like Gintama aside where it's only for comedic effect and the ones doing it get their asses kicked right after, *at least, in Gintama).Besides, her eyes allow her to see shit like at least 1 city block away, she wouldn't need to stalk him or to get that close to begin with if she had creepy or creepily portrayed intents. \n \nPretty sure that realizing the guy is in the same room/area as you and hiding to **avoid** him being too close/getting cold feet when you try to see him 3 years later and hide isn't stalking either, especially since a stalker would want to keep tabs and the object of his interest in his line of sight as much as possible, and fainting defeat that purpose. When I ask \"when in the manga?\", I mean \"where besides the Chunin Exam, Part 1's ending, the start of the Tenchi Bridge Arc, trailing Sasuke and Pain's Arc, the arcs where she appears before the war, and doesn't do any of that stalking?\". See Misa's backstory in Death Note or Mirai Nikki's first episodes to see what stalking really is. \nWhen you're saying that Hinata is a stalker and harasser and that toxic people (because they don't like Sakura) have her as a \"waifu\", yes, you're saying she's bad. \nI didn't even imply you said it, but it goes without saying it's part of your reasoning, that much is obvious. \n\nThe fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics. Especially when Karin is much closer to that and I wouldn't say that about her either, since she's on the road and in Sasuke's team to begin with (well, prior to the war arc anyway. Kishi fucked up and I can't deny he pigeonholed her into that role), because I'm not into throwing another character under the bus to get a point across.

There does not  always have to be a nefarious purpose to stalking; however, it's still not a good thing to do because what Hinata is doing is something without Naruto's consent and purposefully on many occasions I might add. That bakugan vision rly only shows a very limited view  such as chakra as seen  with the anime so using that wouldn't rly do much else, but let her know where he is. All this mental gymnastics because you don't want to accept that she stalked him. You do seem very hurt the fact I pointed out a very common situation in this fandom regarding the way Sakura is viewed in comparison.\n\n \n\"The fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics\"\n   \nIdk what you're getting at but like people are allowed to compare and have their own opinions which is why i even posted in the first place to criticize the very things I've heared regularly.

It's because of my ACTUAL Stalker, I don't like stalkers in anime. It's okay to like Hinata, but throwing away her flaws as a character isn't right. My favorite character is Sasuke, and he was an absolute horrible person and borderline psychotic at times. I'm not going to get made if someone calls out what he did because they would be right. Sakura is a terrible towards naruto in pt 1 and shippuden. Did she grow ? yes. Does she treat naruto like shit anymore? Not really. I don't see why you are so eager to defend the one of the few flaws hinata has.",

The very common situation in that fandom is that there's characters that often gets questionable parts of their writing or (fictional) life glossed over, and Sakura is also part of them (no, I'm not just referring to episode 3, before you claim it's the case). \nI asked for actual instances in the manga and you didn't delve deeper to prove me wrong even though you seemed eager to, excuse me if I don't believe you or if you can't see what stalking actually is. \n\nAnd can you bother to read? I didn't say it's a good thing to do either, I already said \"cases like Gintama aside and they get their asses kicked anyway\" (in Gintama at least), you're telling me nothing that I didn't know. Since I'm not the one being high on that conspiracy mindset about \"only toxic people dislike whatever Sakura does and like everything Hinata does\", you still got me beat on the mental gymnastics department, if I was ever partaking in that BS. You really think toxicity and Hinata are requirements to dislike Sakura? I can't tell if you're overestimating the perception people have of Sakura to get to that point, or if you're doing so for Hinata's overall popularity on purpose. \n\nPretty sure that Sasuke and Itachi, for example, beat her by far in popularity. Not like being fan of them is a requirement to dislike Sakura either : fandoms are big, and the dislike clearly doesn't come from only one fanbase. But it's easier to pinpoint if we pretend everyone is fan of [character], and that they have to be toxic for that, am I right? Btw, why I would I feel \"hurt\" on the fandom's behalf? I like Naruto, but not to that extent. Especially when fandoms always vie within themselves with their fanbases.",

I was fine with that scene in the prison cell because she faking it to stage her evasion. Much less when she joined Sasuke in the war. That's a bigger showing of obsession, and I'm not saying it to throw her under, I go on a record about not doing that. BTW, remind me who essentially pulled a whatboutism instead of trying to just defend the character in their first comment? \n\n... Speaking of it, you're kidding me? That's your first post :\"Toxic part of this fandom: omg she got called annoying and actually thinks she knows what exactly naruto is going through such a useless bitch ahhahaha **why do no women love me**.\". I'd perhaps give the benefit of the doubt (that last part in your comment came out of nowhere, though) about being a deliberate exaggeration, if it wasn't for it being a recurring belief/argument. Also, no, you're the one projecting, I didn't say you've claimed the fans had any impact on Kishi pairing Naruto&Hinata at any point, where does it come from? Check again. \n\nWow, so I threw your experience under the bus even though I'm clearly aware of what stalking entails and that you're just mentioning your life right now, when you didn't in the OG version of your post. Way to go. And i'm not necessarily eager to defend her flaws as much as I dislike seeing wrong stuff being said in general about a character. I also do when people try to pass Naruto off as a sex offender on that very same event, or when Hiruzen gets treated as Danzo's \"good\" version because Part 2 retcons and anime moments make him look bad. I'm sympathetic to her, that's it, and I'm not defending stalking since I believe she doesn't do that. Would you say you're defending uselessness by saying Sakura isn't useless? Same thing, you'd be saying \"it's not that bad\" or something to that effect instead. \n\nAnd the irony about you saying you have no issues with Sasuke's issues being acknowledged but getting pressed when Sakura's are mentioned. If it ticks you, that's your right, but stick to just defending her instead of defaulting to diss an imaginary version of a fandom worshipping a character. Stick to it instead of pretending it's a large scale \"waifu\" problem (and idgaf about those \"waifu\" problems and wars personally).",

All this leads to them surviving as Naruto met Haku)\n* Was going to quit the exam for Naruto. Not Sasuke. Not herself. But so Naruto could become Hokage.\n* Saves Naruto when Orochimaru knocks him out and he was falling from a tree (which Kakashi freaked out that Naruto was going to fall from a tree in wave, thus he was in danger).\n* Keeps watch over Naruto/Sasuke while they are knocked out. Is gassed af and keeps the sound trio busy until reinforcement shows up.\n* When Naruto makes fun of Lee, Sakura puts Naruto in his place. This is a smart move because they are weak and could be picked off... Neji was **pissed** when he learned Lee was harmed by the Sound genin (Neji is another character ppl get wrong, like, Neji even thought Naruto was hilarious and only hated on him when he learned Naruto was defending Hinata, his owner).\n* Sakura, upon learning that Kakashi taught her something (she seems as surprised as I was), uses her skills to wake ppl up. She then goes on a suicide mission. A mission against not level appropriate does (again).\n* When Sasuke told her that Naruto saved her, Sakura doesn't think it's impossible or hate on Naruto but gives him a warm smile as Naruto is trying to learn Chidori. \n* Sakura is not a front line fighter, people seem to hold this against her on the retrieval mission... But like, all the monsters of her generation went and they got lucky and still almost died. \n\n===\n\nPart 2 has issues all over the place and I can't hold it against Sakura that she is one of many, many, issues.\n\n===\n\nBut I will say, Sakura is the only one to actually be an apprentice and surpass her master...

In shipudden she had the perfect chance to grow and she did but then Kishimoto made her do something stupid that the people start to dislike her again . My point being the time she said she 'loves' Naruto and then time she tried to kill Sasuke etc . \n\nIn P1 all the things she did were something a team member should do , it's something that any team member would have done . The only good character development I felt was when she was ready to quit the exam for Naruto's sake . Throughout the written exam she was actually amazing (manga not anime , they made her look stupid there again) . She was gaining respect and then she does something like cutting her own hair even though she could have tried stabbing the Kunoichi . \n\nThis one dude here thinks I just absolutely hate Sakura even though I stated many times that the war arc version is just amazing . \n\nI didn't ignore your comment it's just that it didn't show up in my notifications , also not to mention I have replied to so many comments and I am kinda tired of it at this point",

This isn't a female issue, but a combination of the industry and Kishimoto going toward the lowest common denominator because he didn't have time to write. Lots of great ideas, but needs a great editor.",

Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

And she tanked a hit from Madara in order to create an opening for Sasuke and Naruto to attack. She also healed Naruto and Sasuke after their fight at the final valley. And lastly she is the one who punched Kaguya into Naruto and Sasuke allowing them to seal her up again. That's just what I can remember her doing and I'm sure there is much much more.",

Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that. And that\u2019s just what I can think of right now. I understand if you think differently but please be respectful.",

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

That's treating him badly, but on wildly different matters (and Kiba acknowledged\nNaruto's value after he managed to beat him). Everyone shown dissing him in the background does so on the basis that he's the Fox or its host, and that he's a failure in general, but no one specifically said he sucks because he has no parents, not even Mizuki, I think.\n\nOh, and I doubt most people are specifically hung up about only the 3rd episode, it's only part of the issue, and I don't care that much about her to begin with (not for you OP, but to whoever would jump to say that I'm obsessing about that to defend her, because it's an automatic response to everyone criticizing that scene, followed by a \"what about...\" segment as you can see here).",

Tailing constantly, keeping tabs on said person, and especially with nefarious intent or distorted feelings, in the other hand, does (cases like Gintama aside where it's only for comedic effect and the ones doing it get their asses kicked right after, *at least, in Gintama).Besides, her eyes allow her to see shit like at least 1 city block away, she wouldn't need to stalk him or to get that close to begin with if she had creepy or creepily portrayed intents. \n \nPretty sure that realizing the guy is in the same room/area as you and hiding to **avoid** him being too close/getting cold feet when you try to see him 3 years later and hide isn't stalking either, especially since a stalker would want to keep tabs and the object of his interest in his line of sight as much as possible, and fainting defeat that purpose. When I ask \"when in the manga?\", I mean \"where besides the Chunin Exam, Part 1's ending, the start of the Tenchi Bridge Arc, trailing Sasuke and Pain's Arc, the arcs where she appears before the war, and doesn't do any of that stalking?\". See Misa's backstory in Death Note or Mirai Nikki's first episodes to see what stalking really is. \nWhen you're saying that Hinata is a stalker and harasser and that toxic people (because they don't like Sakura) have her as a \"waifu\", yes, you're saying she's bad. \nI didn't even imply you said it, but it goes without saying it's part of your reasoning, that much is obvious. \n\nThe fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics. Especially when Karin is much closer to that and I wouldn't say that about her either, since she's on the road and in Sasuke's team to begin with (well, prior to the war arc anyway. Kishi fucked up and I can't deny he pigeonholed her into that role), because I'm not into throwing another character under the bus to get a point across.

It's because of my ACTUAL Stalker, I don't like stalkers in anime. It's okay to like Hinata, but throwing away her flaws as a character isn't right. My favorite character is Sasuke, and he was an absolute horrible person and borderline psychotic at times. I'm not going to get made if someone calls out what he did because they would be right. Sakura is a terrible towards naruto in pt 1 and shippuden. Did she grow ? yes. Does she treat naruto like shit anymore? Not really.

You really think toxicity and Hinata are requirements to dislike Sakura? I can't tell if you're overestimating the perception people have of Sakura to get to that point, or if you're doing so for Hinata's overall popularity on purpose. \n\nPretty sure that Sasuke and Itachi, for example, beat her by far in popularity. Not like being fan of them is a requirement to dislike Sakura either : fandoms are big, and the dislike clearly doesn't come from only one fanbase. But it's easier to pinpoint if we pretend everyone is fan of [character], and that they have to be toxic for that, am I right? Btw, why I would I feel \"hurt\" on the fandom's behalf?

That's a bigger showing of obsession, and I'm not saying it to throw her under, I go on a record about not doing that. BTW, remind me who essentially pulled a whatboutism instead of trying to just defend the character in their first comment? \n\n... Speaking of it, you're kidding me? That's your first post :\"Toxic part of this fandom: omg she got called annoying and actually thinks she knows what exactly naruto is going through such a useless bitch ahhahaha **why do no women love me**.\". I'd perhaps give the benefit of the doubt (that last part in your comment came out of nowhere, though) about being a deliberate exaggeration, if it wasn't for it being a recurring belief/argument. Also, no, you're the one projecting, I didn't say you've claimed the fans had any impact on Kishi pairing Naruto&Hinata at any point, where does it come from? Check again. \n\nWow, so I threw your experience under the bus even though I'm clearly aware of what stalking entails and that you're just mentioning your life right now, when you didn't in the OG version of your post. Way to go. And i'm not necessarily eager to defend her flaws as much as I dislike seeing wrong stuff being said in general about a character. I also do when people try to pass Naruto off as a sex offender on that very same event, or when Hiruzen gets treated as Danzo's \"good\" version because Part 2 retcons and anime moments make him look bad. I'm sympathetic to her, that's it, and I'm not defending stalking since I believe she doesn't do that. Would you say you're defending uselessness by saying Sakura isn't useless? Same thing, you'd be saying \"it's not that bad\" or something to that effect instead. \n\nAnd the irony about you saying you have no issues with Sasuke's issues being acknowledged but getting pressed when Sakura's are mentioned. If it ticks you, that's your right, but stick to just defending her instead of defaulting to diss an imaginary version of a fandom worshipping a character. Stick to it instead of pretending it's a large scale \"waifu\" problem (and idgaf about those \"waifu\" problems and wars personally).",

Is gassed af and keeps the sound trio busy until reinforcement shows up.\n* When Naruto makes fun of Lee, Sakura puts Naruto in his place.

Neji was **pissed** when he learned Lee was harmed by the Sound genin (Neji is another character ppl get wrong, like, Neji even thought Naruto was hilarious and only hated on him when he learned Naruto was defending Hinata, his owner).\n* Sakura, upon learning that Kakashi taught her something (she seems as surprised as I was), uses her skills to wake ppl up. She then goes on a suicide mission. A mission against not level appropriate does (again).\n* When Sasuke told her that Naruto saved her, Sakura doesn't think it's impossible or hate on Naruto but gives him a warm smile as Naruto is trying to learn Chidori. \n* Sakura is not a front line fighter, people seem to hold this against her on the retrieval mission...

My point being the time she said she 'loves' Naruto and then time she tried to kill Sasuke etc . \n\nIn P1 all the things she did were something a team member should do , it's something that any team member would have done . The only good character development I felt was when she was ready to quit the exam for Naruto's sake . Throughout the written exam she was actually amazing (manga not anime , they made her look stupid there again) . She was gaining respect and then she does something like cutting her own hair even though she could have tried stabbing the Kunoichi . \n\nThis one dude here thinks I just absolutely hate Sakura even though I stated many times that the war arc version is just amazing . \n\nI didn't ignore your comment it's just that it didn't show up in my notifications , also not to mention I have replied to so many comments and I am kinda tired of it at this point",

Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

When his heart stopped at the end after Kurama got removed from him, she manually beat his heart and gave him mouth to mouth to keep him alive.

And she tanked a hit from Madara in order to create an opening for Sasuke and Naruto to attack. She also healed Naruto and Sasuke after their fight at the final valley. And lastly she is the one who punched Kaguya into Naruto and Sasuke allowing them to seal her up again. That's just what I can remember her doing and I'm sure there is much much more.",

She got a taste, hated it, and began being better to him. And of course I can\u2019t prove anyone else said something bc they didn\u2019t literally do it, but the context of Naruto being bullied and rejected by everyone implies that everyone used to say and do horrible things to him and -again- they chose to show this behavior with Sakura.",

But I\u2019m in the mood today so I\u2019ll say that without her fight during the chunin exams, no matter how much people laugh at her, Naruto and Sasuke would\u2019ve been lost, she didn\u2019t win but she bought them enough time to let Sasuke wake up. Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that. And that\u2019s just what I can think of right now. I understand if you think differently but please be respectful.",

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

Everyone shown dissing him in the background does so on the basis that he's the Fox or its host, and that he's a failure in general, but no one specifically said he sucks because he has no parents, not even Mizuki, I think.\n\nOh, and I doubt most people are specifically hung up about only the 3rd episode, it's only part of the issue, and I don't care that much about her to begin with (not for you OP, but to whoever would jump to say that I'm obsessing about that to defend her, because it's an automatic response to everyone criticizing that scene, followed by a \"what about...\" segment as you can see here).",

Compare and contrasting has been integral to how people analyze characters whether growth, behavior, feats, etc. Did I say Hinata is bad? No. Did I say anymore than what she actually did? No. What type of post is this ? a Sakura hate post. Do I personally like sakura. No not really. Sakura did awful things to Naruto, but she isnt like that anymore. And Hinata was a stalker, but now she isn't the characters did move past their flaws.

Tailing constantly, keeping tabs on said person, and especially with nefarious intent or distorted feelings, in the other hand, does (cases like Gintama aside where it's only for comedic effect and the ones doing it get their asses kicked right after, *at least, in Gintama).Besides, her eyes allow her to see shit like at least 1 city block away, she wouldn't need to stalk him or to get that close to begin with if she had creepy or creepily portrayed intents. \n \nPretty sure that realizing the guy is in the same room/area as you and hiding to **avoid** him being too close/getting cold feet when you try to see him 3 years later and hide isn't stalking either, especially since a stalker would want to keep tabs and the object of his interest in his line of sight as much as possible, and fainting defeat that purpose. When I ask \"when in the manga?\", I mean \"where besides the Chunin Exam, Part 1's ending, the start of the Tenchi Bridge Arc, trailing Sasuke and Pain's Arc, the arcs where she appears before the war, and doesn't do any of that stalking?\". See Misa's backstory in Death Note or Mirai Nikki's first episodes to see what stalking really is. \nWhen you're saying that Hinata is a stalker and harasser and that toxic people (because they don't like Sakura) have her as a \"waifu\", yes, you're saying she's bad. \nI didn't even imply you said it, but it goes without saying it's part of your reasoning, that much is obvious. \n\nThe fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics. Especially when Karin is much closer to that and I wouldn't say that about her either, since she's on the road and in Sasuke's team to begin with (well, prior to the war arc anyway. Kishi fucked up and I can't deny he pigeonholed her into that role), because I'm not into throwing another character under the bus to get a point across.

There does not  always have to be a nefarious purpose to stalking; however, it's still not a good thing to do because what Hinata is doing is something without Naruto's consent and purposefully on many occasions I might add. That bakugan vision rly only shows a very limited view  such as chakra as seen  with the anime so using that wouldn't rly do much else, but let her know where he is. All this mental gymnastics because you don't want to accept that she stalked him. You do seem very hurt the fact I pointed out a very common situation in this fandom regarding the way Sakura is viewed in comparison.\n\n \n\"The fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics\"\n   \nIdk what you're getting at but like people are allowed to compare and have their own opinions which is why i even posted in the first place to criticize the very things I've heared regularly.

It's because of my ACTUAL Stalker, I don't like stalkers in anime. It's okay to like Hinata, but throwing away her flaws as a character isn't right. My favorite character is Sasuke, and he was an absolute horrible person and borderline psychotic at times. I'm not going to get made if someone calls out what he did because they would be right. Sakura is a terrible towards naruto in pt 1 and shippuden. Did she grow ? yes. Does she treat naruto like shit anymore? Not really.

The very common situation in that fandom is that there's characters that often gets questionable parts of their writing or (fictional) life glossed over, and Sakura is also part of them (no, I'm not just referring to episode 3, before you claim it's the case). \nI asked for actual instances in the manga and you didn't delve deeper to prove me wrong even though you seemed eager to, excuse me if I don't believe you or if you can't see what stalking actually is. \n\nAnd can you bother to read? I didn't say it's a good thing to do either, I already said \"cases like Gintama aside and they get their asses kicked anyway\" (in Gintama at least), you're telling me nothing that I didn't know. Since I'm not the one being high on that conspiracy mindset about \"only toxic people dislike whatever Sakura does and like everything Hinata does\", you still got me beat on the mental gymnastics department, if I was ever partaking in that BS. You really think toxicity and Hinata are requirements to dislike Sakura? I can't tell if you're overestimating the perception people have of Sakura to get to that point, or if you're doing so for Hinata's overall popularity on purpose. \n\nPretty sure that Sasuke and Itachi, for example, beat her by far in popularity. Not like being fan of them is a requirement to dislike Sakura either : fandoms are big, and the dislike clearly doesn't come from only one fanbase. But it's easier to pinpoint if we pretend everyone is fan of [character], and that they have to be toxic for that, am I right? Btw, why I would I feel \"hurt\" on the fandom's behalf? I like Naruto, but not to that extent. Especially when fandoms always vie within themselves with their fanbases.",

I was fine with that scene in the prison cell because she faking it to stage her evasion. Much less when she joined Sasuke in the war. That's a bigger showing of obsession, and I'm not saying it to throw her under, I go on a record about not doing that. BTW, remind me who essentially pulled a whatboutism instead of trying to just defend the character in their first comment? \n\n... Speaking of it, you're kidding me? That's your first post :\"Toxic part of this fandom: omg she got called annoying and actually thinks she knows what exactly naruto is going through such a useless bitch ahhahaha **why do no women love me**.\". I'd perhaps give the benefit of the doubt (that last part in your comment came out of nowhere, though) about being a deliberate exaggeration, if it wasn't for it being a recurring belief/argument. Also, no, you're the one projecting, I didn't say you've claimed the fans had any impact on Kishi pairing Naruto&Hinata at any point, where does it come from? Check again. \n\nWow, so I threw your experience under the bus even though I'm clearly aware of what stalking entails and that you're just mentioning your life right now, when you didn't in the OG version of your post. Way to go. And i'm not necessarily eager to defend her flaws as much as I dislike seeing wrong stuff being said in general about a character. I also do when people try to pass Naruto off as a sex offender on that very same event, or when Hiruzen gets treated as Danzo's \"good\" version because Part 2 retcons and anime moments make him look bad. I'm sympathetic to her, that's it, and I'm not defending stalking since I believe she doesn't do that. Would you say you're defending uselessness by saying Sakura isn't useless? Same thing, you'd be saying \"it's not that bad\" or something to that effect instead. \n\nAnd the irony about you saying you have no issues with Sasuke's issues being acknowledged but getting pressed when Sakura's are mentioned. If it ticks you, that's your right, but stick to just defending her instead of defaulting to diss an imaginary version of a fandom worshipping a character. Stick to it instead of pretending it's a large scale \"waifu\" problem (and idgaf about those \"waifu\" problems and wars personally).",

My point being the time she said she 'loves' Naruto and then time she tried to kill Sasuke etc . \n\nIn P1 all the things she did were something a team member should do , it's something that any team member would have done . The only good character development I felt was when she was ready to quit the exam for Naruto's sake . Throughout the written exam she was actually amazing (manga not anime , they made her look stupid there again) . She was gaining respect and then she does something like cutting her own hair even though she could have tried stabbing the Kunoichi . \n\nThis one dude here thinks I just absolutely hate Sakura even though I stated many times that the war arc version is just amazing . \n\nI didn't ignore your comment it's just that it didn't show up in my notifications , also not to mention I have replied to so many comments and I am kinda tired of it at this point",

                                    "body": "The Big Bunny Mommy issue is that Kishimoto did the \"Surprise Twist\" villain bullshit a few times.\n\nLeaving part 1 there are two main villains that we expect to deal with in part 2. Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

He later on regrets (when he's taking a dump) accidentally making Sasuke look cooler or prone to romance (when he joked about her forehead and said \"this is what Naruto would say\"). He intended to make look Sasuke look like a douche thereafter to \"correct\" it, but there weren't any sexual offense happening on Naruto's end.",

She got a taste, hated it, and began being better to him. And of course I can\u2019t prove anyone else said something bc they didn\u2019t literally do it, but the context of Naruto being bullied and rejected by everyone implies that everyone used to say and do horrible things to him and -again- they chose to show this behavior with Sakura.",

Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that.

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

Everyone shown dissing him in the background does so on the basis that he's the Fox or its host, and that he's a failure in general, but no one specifically said he sucks because he has no parents, not even Mizuki, I think.\n\nOh, and I doubt most people are specifically hung up about only the 3rd episode, it's only part of the issue, and I don't care that much about her to begin with (not for you OP, but to whoever would jump to say that I'm obsessing about that to defend her, because it's an automatic response to everyone criticizing that scene, followed by a \"what about...\" segment as you can see here).",

Tailing constantly, keeping tabs on said person, and especially with nefarious intent or distorted feelings, in the other hand, does (cases like Gintama aside where it's only for comedic effect and the ones doing it get their asses kicked right after, *at least, in Gintama).Besides, her eyes allow her to see shit like at least 1 city block away, she wouldn't need to stalk him or to get that close to begin with if she had creepy or creepily portrayed intents. \n \nPretty sure that realizing the guy is in the same room/area as you and hiding to **avoid** him being too close/getting cold feet when you try to see him 3 years later and hide isn't stalking either, especially since a stalker would want to keep tabs and the object of his interest in his line of sight as much as possible, and fainting defeat that purpose. When I ask \"when in the manga?\", I mean \"where besides the Chunin Exam, Part 1's ending, the start of the Tenchi Bridge Arc, trailing Sasuke and Pain's Arc, the arcs where she appears before the war, and doesn't do any of that stalking?\". See Misa's backstory in Death Note or Mirai Nikki's first episodes to see what stalking really is. \nWhen you're saying that Hinata is a stalker and harasser and that toxic people (because they don't like Sakura) have her as a \"waifu\", yes, you're saying she's bad. \nI didn't even imply you said it, but it goes without saying it's part of your reasoning, that much is obvious. \n\nThe fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics. Especially when Karin is much closer to that and I wouldn't say that about her either, since she's on the road and in Sasuke's team to begin with (well, prior to the war arc anyway. Kishi fucked up and I can't deny he pigeonholed her into that role), because I'm not into throwing another character under the bus to get a point across. Any fictional character can be judged at any point of time of their existence and at any point of ours. No exceptions, and no IRL BS assumptions about others because it's too much to handle.",

There does not  always have to be a nefarious purpose to stalking; however, it's still not a good thing to do because what Hinata is doing is something without Naruto's consent and purposefully on many occasions I might add. That bakugan vision rly only shows a very limited view  such as chakra as seen  with the anime so using that wouldn't rly do much else, but let her know where he is. All this mental gymnastics because you don't want to accept that she stalked him. You do seem very hurt the fact I pointed out a very common situation in this fandom regarding the way Sakura is viewed in comparison.\n\n \n\"The fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics\"\n   \nIdk what you're getting at but like people are allowed to compare and have their own opinions which is why i even posted in the first place to criticize the very things I've heared regularly. I made no mention of failing to get relationships with women nor did i say THEY  had any  power to influence kish's choosing naruto to be with Hinata, so idk why you are projecting.\n\n\n\"Especially when Karin is much closer to that and I wouldn't say that about her either, since she's on the road and in Sasuke's team to begin with (well, prior to the war arc anyway.

It's because of my ACTUAL Stalker, I don't like stalkers in anime. It's okay to like Hinata, but throwing away her flaws as a character isn't right. My favorite character is Sasuke, and he was an absolute horrible person and borderline psychotic at times. I'm not going to get made if someone calls out what he did because they would be right. Sakura is a terrible towards naruto in pt 1 and shippuden. Did she grow ? yes. Does she treat naruto like shit anymore? Not really. I don't see why you are so eager to defend the one of the few flaws hinata has.",

The very common situation in that fandom is that there's characters that often gets questionable parts of their writing or (fictional) life glossed over, and Sakura is also part of them (no, I'm not just referring to episode 3, before you claim it's the case). \nI asked for actual instances in the manga and you didn't delve deeper to prove me wrong even though you seemed eager to, excuse me if I don't believe you or if you can't see what stalking actually is. \n\nAnd can you bother to read? I didn't say it's a good thing to do either, I already said \"cases like Gintama aside and they get their asses kicked anyway\" (in Gintama at least), you're telling me nothing that I didn't know. Since I'm not the one being high on that conspiracy mindset about \"only toxic people dislike whatever Sakura does and like everything Hinata does\", you still got me beat on the mental gymnastics department, if I was ever partaking in that BS. You really think toxicity and Hinata are requirements to dislike Sakura? I can't tell if you're overestimating the perception people have of Sakura to get to that point, or if you're doing so for Hinata's overall popularity on purpose. \n\nPretty sure that Sasuke and Itachi, for example, beat her by far in popularity. Not like being fan of them is a requirement to dislike Sakura either : fandoms are big, and the dislike clearly doesn't come from only one fanbase. But it's easier to pinpoint if we pretend everyone is fan of [character], and that they have to be toxic for that, am I right? Btw, why I would I feel \"hurt\" on the fandom's behalf? I like Naruto, but not to that extent. Especially when fandoms always vie within themselves with their fanbases.",

I was fine with that scene in the prison cell because she faking it to stage her evasion. Much less when she joined Sasuke in the war. That's a bigger showing of obsession, and I'm not saying it to throw her under, I go on a record about not doing that. BTW, remind me who essentially pulled a whatboutism instead of trying to just defend the character in their first comment? \n\n... Speaking of it, you're kidding me? That's your first post :\"Toxic part of this fandom: omg she got called annoying and actually thinks she knows what exactly naruto is going through such a useless bitch ahhahaha **why do no women love me**.\". I'd perhaps give the benefit of the doubt (that last part in your comment came out of nowhere, though) about being a deliberate exaggeration, if it wasn't for it being a recurring belief/argument. Also, no, you're the one projecting, I didn't say you've claimed the fans had any impact on Kishi pairing Naruto&Hinata at any point, where does it come from? Check again. \n\nWow, so I threw your experience under the bus even though I'm clearly aware of what stalking entails and that you're just mentioning your life right now, when you didn't in the OG version of your post. Way to go. And i'm not necessarily eager to defend her flaws as much as I dislike seeing wrong stuff being said in general about a character. I also do when people try to pass Naruto off as a sex offender on that very same event, or when Hiruzen gets treated as Danzo's \"good\" version because Part 2 retcons and anime moments make him look bad. I'm sympathetic to her, that's it, and I'm not defending stalking since I believe she doesn't do that. Would you say you're defending uselessness by saying Sakura isn't useless? Same thing, you'd be saying \"it's not that bad\" or something to that effect instead. \n\nAnd the irony about you saying you have no issues with Sasuke's issues being acknowledged but getting pressed when Sakura's are mentioned. If it ticks you, that's your right, but stick to just defending her instead of defaulting to diss an imaginary version of a fandom worshipping a character. Stick to it instead of pretending it's a large scale \"waifu\" problem (and idgaf about those \"waifu\" problems and wars personally).",

Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

She got a taste, hated it, and began being better to him. And of course I can\u2019t prove anyone else said something bc they didn\u2019t literally do it, but the context of Naruto being bullied and rejected by everyone implies that everyone used to say and do horrible things to him and -again- they chose to show this behavior with Sakura.",

Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that. And that\u2019s just what I can think of right now. I understand if you think differently but please be respectful.",

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

                                            "body": "Sorry I can\u2019t answer in the same format as you I\u2019m still kinda new here and don\u2019t know how to quote\ud83d\ude05. And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

There does not  always have to be a nefarious purpose to stalking; however, it's still not a good thing to do because what Hinata is doing is something without Naruto's consent and purposefully on many occasions I might add. That bakugan vision rly only shows a very limited view  such as chakra as seen  with the anime so using that wouldn't rly do much else, but let her know where he is. All this mental gymnastics because you don't want to accept that she stalked him. You do seem very hurt the fact I pointed out a very common situation in this fandom regarding the way Sakura is viewed in comparison.\n\n \n\"The fact you're equating people disliking Sakura for a genuinely wack moment to toxicity and failing to get relationships with women and somehow assumed they were all behind Hinata is pretty much mental gymnastics\"\n   \nIdk what you're getting at but like people are allowed to compare and have their own opinions which is why i even posted in the first place to criticize the very things I've heared regularly. I made no mention of failing to get relationships with women nor did i say THEY  had any  power to influence kish's choosing naruto to be with Hinata, so idk why you are projecting.\n\n\n\"Especially when Karin is much closer to that and I wouldn't say that about her either, since she's on the road and in Sasuke's team to begin with (well, prior to the war arc anyway. Kishi fucked up and I can't deny he pigeonholed her into that role), because I'm not into throwing another character under the bus to get a point across. Any fictional character can be judged at any point of time of their existence and at any point of ours. No exceptions, and no IRL BS assumptions about others because it's too much to handle.\" \n\nBro you just threw karin under the bus and my irl experience. It's because of my ACTUAL Stalker, I don't like stalkers in anime. It's okay to like Hinata, but throwing away her flaws as a character isn't right. My favorite character is Sasuke, and he was an absolute horrible person and borderline psychotic at times. I'm not going to get made if someone calls out what he did because they would be right. Sakura is a terrible towards naruto in pt 1 and shippuden. Did she grow ? yes. Does she treat naruto like shit anymore? Not really. I don't see why you are so eager to defend the one of the few flaws hinata has.",

The very common situation in that fandom is that there's characters that often gets questionable parts of their writing or (fictional) life glossed over, and Sakura is also part of them (no, I'm not just referring to episode 3, before you claim it's the case). \nI asked for actual instances in the manga and you didn't delve deeper to prove me wrong even though you seemed eager to, excuse me if I don't believe you or if you can't see what stalking actually is. \n\nAnd can you bother to read? I didn't say it's a good thing to do either, I already said \"cases like Gintama aside and they get their asses kicked anyway\" (in Gintama at least), you're telling me nothing that I didn't know. Since I'm not the one being high on that conspiracy mindset about \"only toxic people dislike whatever Sakura does and like everything Hinata does\", you still got me beat on the mental gymnastics department, if I was ever partaking in that BS. You really think toxicity and Hinata are requirements to dislike Sakura? I can't tell if you're overestimating the perception people have of Sakura to get to that point, or if you're doing so for Hinata's overall popularity on purpose. \n\nPretty sure that Sasuke and Itachi, for example, beat her by far in popularity. Not like being fan of them is a requirement to dislike Sakura either : fandoms are big, and the dislike clearly doesn't come from only one fanbase. But it's easier to pinpoint if we pretend everyone is fan of [character], and that they have to be toxic for that, am I right? Btw, why I would I feel \"hurt\" on the fandom's behalf? I like Naruto, but not to that extent. Especially when fandoms always vie within themselves with their fanbases.",

I was fine with that scene in the prison cell because she faking it to stage her evasion. Much less when she joined Sasuke in the war. That's a bigger showing of obsession, and I'm not saying it to throw her under, I go on a record about not doing that. BTW, remind me who essentially pulled a whatboutism instead of trying to just defend the character in their first comment? \n\n... Speaking of it, you're kidding me? That's your first post :\"Toxic part of this fandom: omg she got called annoying and actually thinks she knows what exactly naruto is going through such a useless bitch ahhahaha **why do no women love me**.\". I'd perhaps give the benefit of the doubt (that last part in your comment came out of nowhere, though) about being a deliberate exaggeration, if it wasn't for it being a recurring belief/argument. Also, no, you're the one projecting, I didn't say you've claimed the fans had any impact on Kishi pairing Naruto&Hinata at any point, where does it come from? Check again. \n\nWow, so I threw your experience under the bus even though I'm clearly aware of what stalking entails and that you're just mentioning your life right now, when you didn't in the OG version of your post. Way to go. And i'm not necessarily eager to defend her flaws as much as I dislike seeing wrong stuff being said in general about a character. I also do when people try to pass Naruto off as a sex offender on that very same event, or when Hiruzen gets treated as Danzo's \"good\" version because Part 2 retcons and anime moments make him look bad. I'm sympathetic to her, that's it, and I'm not defending stalking since I believe she doesn't do that. Would you say you're defending uselessness by saying Sakura isn't useless? Same thing, you'd be saying \"it's not that bad\" or something to that effect instead. \n\nAnd the irony about you saying you have no issues with Sasuke's issues being acknowledged but getting pressed when Sakura's are mentioned. If it ticks you, that's your right, but stick to just defending her instead of defaulting to diss an imaginary version of a fandom worshipping a character. Stick to it instead of pretending it's a large scale \"waifu\" problem (and idgaf about those \"waifu\" problems and wars personally).",

                    "body": "The Big Bunny Mommy issue is that Kishimoto did the \"Surprise Twist\" villain bullshit a few times.\n\nLeaving part 1 there are two main villains that we expect to deal with in part 2. Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

Any part of a character's story can be talked about at any point of time, no exceptions. \nAnd that's also assuming that it's the only reason (or that's how it sounds when reading defensive replies) people have an issue with her, and that a personal grudge would form only over that. \n\nAt least, when it comes that specific scene, else the assumptions shift to many things like lack in power, lack in body or real life slander like \"you got rejected/you're misogynistic \n\", etc. Funny you mention judging ragging on a fictional 12yo for unfounded reasons when lately, many are running with the idea that Naruto tried to sexually assault her by impersonating Sasuke when he was only there to get her opinion on himself and then she tried to kiss \"Sasuke\". \nNot saying that you did (to my knowledge, not in that section for sure, and I hope not), but many of the defenders aren't much better than the detractors on that one, since they're straight up making things up to make her look like the better person in that interaction.",

He later on regrets (when he's taking a dump) accidentally making Sasuke look cooler or prone to romance (when he joked about her forehead and said \"this is what Naruto would say\"). He intended to make look Sasuke look like a douche thereafter to \"correct\" it, but there weren't any sexual offense happening on Naruto's end.",

Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that.

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

I didn't say it's a good thing to do either, I already said \"cases like Gintama aside and they get their asses kicked anyway\" (in Gintama at least), you're telling me nothing that I didn't know. Since I'm not the one being high on that conspiracy mindset about \"only toxic people dislike whatever Sakura does and like everything Hinata does\", you still got me beat on the mental gymnastics department, if I was ever partaking in that BS. You really think toxicity and Hinata are requirements to dislike Sakura? I can't tell if you're overestimating the perception people have of Sakura to get to that point, or if you're doing so for Hinata's overall popularity on purpose. \n\nPretty sure that Sasuke and Itachi, for example, beat her by far in popularity. Not like being fan of them is a requirement to dislike Sakura either : fandoms are big, and the dislike clearly doesn't come from only one fanbase. But it's easier to pinpoint if we pretend everyone is fan of [character], and that they have to be toxic for that, am I right? Btw, why I would I feel \"hurt\" on the fandom's behalf? I like Naruto, but not to that extent. Especially when fandoms always vie within themselves with their fanbases.",

I was fine with that scene in the prison cell because she faking it to stage her evasion. Much less when she joined Sasuke in the war. That's a bigger showing of obsession, and I'm not saying it to throw her under, I go on a record about not doing that. BTW, remind me who essentially pulled a whatboutism instead of trying to just defend the character in their first comment? \n\n... Speaking of it, you're kidding me? That's your first post :\"Toxic part of this fandom: omg she got called annoying and actually thinks she knows what exactly naruto is going through such a useless bitch ahhahaha **why do no women love me**.\". I'd perhaps give the benefit of the doubt (that last part in your comment came out of nowhere, though) about being a deliberate exaggeration, if it wasn't for it being a recurring belief/argument. Also, no, you're the one projecting, I didn't say you've claimed the fans had any impact on Kishi pairing Naruto&Hinata at any point, where does it come from? Check again. \n\nWow, so I threw your experience under the bus even though I'm clearly aware of what stalking entails and that you're just mentioning your life right now, when you didn't in the OG version of your post. Way to go. And i'm not necessarily eager to defend her flaws as much as I dislike seeing wrong stuff being said in general about a character. I also do when people try to pass Naruto off as a sex offender on that very same event, or when Hiruzen gets treated as Danzo's \"good\" version because Part 2 retcons and anime moments make him look bad. I'm sympathetic to her, that's it, and I'm not defending stalking since I believe she doesn't do that. Would you say you're defending uselessness by saying Sakura isn't useless? Same thing, you'd be saying \"it's not that bad\" or something to that effect instead. \n\nAnd the irony about you saying you have no issues with Sasuke's issues being acknowledged but getting pressed when Sakura's are mentioned. If it ticks you, that's your right, but stick to just defending her instead of defaulting to diss an imaginary version of a fandom worshipping a character. Stick to it instead of pretending it's a large scale \"waifu\" problem (and idgaf about those \"waifu\" problems and wars personally).",

Orochimaru and Akatsuki. Orochimaru killed Hiruzen, destroyed the city a bit, started a war, killed the Kazekage, harassed Naruto on multiple occasions, and \"stole\" Sasuke. This is the personal villain for Naruto. Where Sasuke has Itachi as his personal villain, Naruto has Orochimaru. \n\nHowever part 2 doesn't show Naruto caring about all the things Orochimaru has done except for the Sasuke part, which is interesting af but also a let down. Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and while yeah, that makes sense, it's very underwhelming (especially with how Itachi later ass pulls an ability to stop Orochimaru). \n\nThen we get Pain, who is the business villain for Naruto but he gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Tobi. Tobi get M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Madara. Madara gets M Night Shamalamadingdong'ed by Zetsu. The the final \"what a twist\" is Big Bunny Mommy.\n\nTobi is Kakashi's personal villain, or should be, but that gets rushed...\n\nPart 2 has some insanely awesome ideas, some insanely awesome visuals, but the writing is just not very good. \n\nI blame the fame and time crunch. Naruto might be the first anime to get popular in the West at the same time it was being made. Even Dragon Ball Z didn't get this popular in the 90's in the US, it was more after the fact. The merch for Naruto was everywhere and you couldn't go a day in middle school/high school in the early 2000 without seeing a ninja headband or some kid doing hand seals. Naruto popularity was in-fucking-sane. So Kishimoto and the team did what would make money and keep interest by continuing to arbitrary raise the stakes... and it reminds me of the DBZ Buu arc. People didn't like the return to a more grounded storyline with Gohan going to highschool so they brought back Goku and now every story line is pretty much the same formulaic stuff of arbritarily raising the stakes.",

He later on regrets (when he's taking a dump) accidentally making Sasuke look cooler or prone to romance (when he joked about her forehead and said \"this is what Naruto would say\"). He intended to make look Sasuke look like a douche thereafter to \"correct\" it, but there weren't any sexual offense happening on Naruto's end.",

Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth. She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe. She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times. She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara. She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams and believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him. She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin. She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team and both Kakashi and Tsunade stated she was a prodigy bc of that.

Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

I just don't like the version's of Sakura before WA . \n\n>without her fight during the chunin exams, no matter how much people laugh at her, Naruto and Sasuke would\u2019ve been lost, she didn\u2019t win but she bought them enough time to let Sasuke wake up.\n\nYour wrong here actually . Her fight actually had no relevance to the other fights . Her motives were not to extend the fight . She wanted to win , that's all.\n\n>Her cutting her hair off was a very big symbol of internal change and growth.\n\nInstead of doing that with the Kunai she could have easily stabbed her opponent , and before you say that she shouldn't , it's the chunin exams and she is a shinobi . \n\n> She was willing to give up in the first test of the chunin exams even though she knew all the answers (which almost no one did) just so that Naruto\u2019s dream would be safe.\n\nAgreed,  a really good point but after that not much really . \n\n>She identified genjutsu created by much stronger shinobi two times.\n\nThat's because it's her specialty . She was considered a prodigy in genjutsu resistance only . She wasn't really a prodigy so to say . A prodigy is someone like Minato or Itachi . \n\n>She was ready to defend Sasuke from Gaara\n\nShe was also ready to leave the village with him and shit but that is another reason people hate her and that's coz of her simping nature . \n\n>She believed in Naruto so much she cheered for him in the one on one fight of the exams \n\nNaruto is a part of team 7 and I mean anyone would except Neji I guess ? \n\n>believed if there was someone who could bring Sasuke back it\u2019s him.\n\nAnother thing people don't like about her - always crying and asking for help . Example PA also . \n\n>She freed herself from Ino\u2019s shintenshin.\n\nI mean that's just not even a point towards character development as such . She was already on bad terms with Ino since they both found out they liked Sasuke .\n\n> She demonstrated she had the best chakra control of her team\n\nThat isn't character development as such but I mean ya she has good chakra control . She is later surpassed by Naruto and Sasuke though . \n\nWA Naruto is able to have such good chakra control that he is able to mold Kurama's chakra to fit every Shinobi . Sasuke is able to match his inferno style with Naruto wind style even after not being a team for years . \n\nThese are my point and my debunks , if you want we can debate in Discord dm's coz it's easier honestly",

And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

Any part of a character's story can be talked about at any point of time, no exceptions. \nAnd that's also assuming that it's the only reason (or that's how it sounds when reading defensive replies) people have an issue with her, and that a personal grudge would form only over that. \n\nAt least, when it comes that specific scene, else the assumptions shift to many things like lack in power, lack in body or real life slander like \"you got rejected/you're misogynistic \n\", etc. Funny you mention judging ragging on a fictional 12yo for unfounded reasons when lately, many are running with the idea that Naruto tried to sexually assault her by impersonating Sasuke when he was only there to get her opinion on himself and then she tried to kiss \"Sasuke\". \nNot saying that you did (to my knowledge, not in that section for sure, and I hope not), but many of the defenders aren't much better than the detractors on that one, since they're straight up making things up to make her look like the better person in that interaction.",

He later on regrets (when he's taking a dump) accidentally making Sasuke look cooler or prone to romance (when he joked about her forehead and said \"this is what Naruto would say\"). He intended to make look Sasuke look like a douche thereafter to \"correct\" it, but there weren't any sexual offense happening on Naruto's end.",

            "body": "Sorry I can\u2019t answer in the same format as you I\u2019m still kinda new here and don\u2019t know how to quote\ud83d\ude05. And I don\u2019t have a discord account so can\u2019t reach out through there. So it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t answer anymore, I get it\u2019s a bit tedious. Also thanks for being respectful and showing me your perspective, I value it a lot.\n1. Yeah, she wanted to win and didn\u2019t, but had she just whined and surrendered as some people say she always does the sound ninjas would\u2019ve gotten the boys bc they wouldn\u2019t have had any obstacle (not that she was the greatest obstacle but yeah). She didn\u2019t mean to gain time to let Sasuke wake up, but she did.\n2. She didn\u2019t stab the sound kunoichi because it wouldn\u2019t have worked, she was in a very bad position and the sound kunoichi would\u2019ve stopped any attack. And what I said stands: it was a symbolic moment where she acknowledges she had be superficial, vane and of very little use to the team and she renounces all that and decides to focus more on being a ninja which she does (mostly by the end when she reaches out to Tsunade)\n3. Also agree with you, Sakura definitely doesn\u2019t have the best writing and specially in the anime SP was always screwing her over, specially in the first part. You can see character development in the first part (which I really like) but it\u2019s not at all as good as the character called for.\n4. Yeah, that was a big talent though back then wasn\u2019t so big as to say she was a prodigy (now, seeing how she did in The Last, maybe one could say she is one) but back when she was 12 and most people fell for it, it was a big thing to do.\n5. Also agreed but it has nothing to do with my point, she was also ready to protect the man from their first mission, it happened constantly but she was always used as the damsel in distress so the boys could have the spotlight. But yeah, she was a simp, so was Hinata, and all bc of female stereotypes. Both their feelings matured in shippuden though.\n6. Actually only her and Hinata were openly cheering for him (well, Hinata was quietly doing so but you get the point) against Kiba and only Sakura when he was against Neji bc Hinata was in the hospital I think (?).\n7. She only asked for help bc Shikamaru wouldn\u2019t let her go with them, and it was then when she started crying out of frustration and sadness. And she cried during PA bc she saw the whole village destroyed, knew too many people were dead and she knew she couldn\u2019t fight Pain (literally no one but Naruto could) so, very valid reason to cry, honestly.\n8. That\u2019s not a point for character development, just a moment that shows how strong her will and mind are. Her being in bad terms with Ino doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And for character development there\u2019s their reconciliation at the end of the fight where they both acknowledge each other as ninjas and let their feelings for Sasuke aside (they both still like him but now they\u2019re friends again and have a healthy rivalry).\n9. Again, not a point for character development but a point about her strengths. And no, they don\u2019t surpass her in that area, she still has the best chakra control, but the other two have more of it plus stronger attacks (she has amazing strength and is great in the battlefield but ultimately is a medical ninja), and genetic advantages. Naruto also is (was\ud83e\udd7a) a jinchurini so yeah, a thousand more strength points to him. Not saying the boys don\u2019t have great chakra control, but Sakura\u2019s is extremely precise bc of her medical abilities. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it\u2019s so long. I\u2019d like to join discord though, will try  to learn how to use it bc I\u2019m the worst with tech and digital stuff but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better platform for discussion.",

Any part of a character's story can be talked about at any point of time, no exceptions. \nAnd that's also assuming that it's the only reason (or that's how it sounds when reading defensive replies) people have an issue with her, and that a personal grudge would form only over that. \n\nAt least, when it comes that specific scene, else the assumptions shift to many things like lack in power, lack in body or real life slander like \"you got rejected/you're misogynistic \n\", etc. Funny you mention judging ragging on a fictional 12yo for unfounded reasons when lately, many are running with the idea that Naruto tried to sexually assault her by impersonating Sasuke when he was only there to get her opinion on himself and then she tried to kiss \"Sasuke\". \nNot saying that you did (to my knowledge, not in that section for sure, and I hope not), but many of the defenders aren't much better than the detractors on that one, since they're straight up making things up to make her look like the better person in that interaction.",

Any part of a character's story can be talked about at any point of time, no exceptions. \nAnd that's also assuming that it's the only reason (or that's how it sounds when reading defensive replies) people have an issue with her, and that a personal grudge would form only over that. \n\nAt least, when it comes that specific scene, else the assumptions shift to many things like lack in power, lack in body or real life slander like \"you got rejected/you're misogynistic \n\", etc. Funny you mention judging ragging on a fictional 12yo for unfounded reasons when lately, many are running with the idea that Naruto tried to sexually assault her by impersonating Sasuke when he was only there to get her opinion on himself and then she tried to kiss \"Sasuke\". \nNot saying that you did (to my knowledge, not in that section for sure, and I hope not), but many of the defenders aren't much better than the detractors on that one, since they're straight up making things up to make her look like the better person in that interaction.",

Any part of a character's story can be talked about at any point of time, no exceptions. \nAnd that's also assuming that it's the only reason (or that's how it sounds when reading defensive replies) people have an issue with her, and that a personal grudge would form only over that. \n\nAt least, when it comes that specific scene, else the assumptions shift to many things like lack in power, lack in body or real life slander like \"you got rejected/you're misogynistic \n\", etc. Funny you mention judging ragging on a fictional 12yo for unfounded reasons when lately, many are running with the idea that Naruto tried to sexually assault her by impersonating Sasuke when he was only there to get her opinion on himself and then she tried to kiss \"Sasuke\". \nNot saying that you did (to my knowledge, not in that section for sure, and I hope not), but many of the defenders aren't much better than the detractors on that one, since they're straight up making things up to make her look like the better person in that interaction.",
