    "body": "My mom is a typical Asian mom, conservative, hardworking, goes to church regularly and very much traditional. We were at the dinner table and the topic of sugar relationships came up. \n\nI explained to her that the way it works is that, SDs would give allowances (mostly to help with tuition), gifts, take them out on vacations and sometimes mentor them and introduce them to people to help them advance with their career. SBs on the other hand, work on themselves while the SDs support them. I also brought up that sex is mostly involved and that men are more often than not, married.\n\nHer reaction was, \u201cIsn\u2019t it like selling a woman\u2019s body and youth? Like prostitution?\u201d She followed up, \u201cI don\u2019t agree on relationships with married men. But isn\u2019t that how relationships supposed to be? You keep a man happy and he makes you happy. I\u2019ve seen you cry over a guy who doesn\u2019t even have money and cheats on you, wasting your time and youth. You have sex and then what? Your father and I didn\u2019t work hard only for you to be someone\u2019s rag. I\u2019d rather see you with an old man who makes your life better. I hate seeing beautiful women wasting their lives with undeserving men.\u201d That really hit a nail on the head.\n\nI was so surprised by her reaction. I was left speechless.\n\nOf course, we also talked about the reality and dangers of it. She agreed that bad people are out there to take advantage no matter what situation you\u2019re in and we all have to be smart about handling it.",

The experiences in the bowl (with the right guys) will get you used to a different caliber of man than you have seen in the past.
