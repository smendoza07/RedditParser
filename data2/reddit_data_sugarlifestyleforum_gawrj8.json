    "body": "**Mandatory Disclaimer:** Everything you read here is true. This really happened. Some dialogue has been recreated due to poor memory but, to the best of my ability, everything here is factual. Two years ago, I tried Sugar Tinder^(TM), and this is my story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a girl who looks for more organic relationships than the usual tit-for-tat found on SA, I was thrilled to see posts on this forum about using Tinder for Sugar. The success stories varied wildly, but I felt with my knowledge and feel for people I could use Tinder as a more organic approach to finding a spoiled relationship. I was tired of the same old pay for play. I set up my profile hinting about liking the finer things in life, included a fun and flirty photo of myself from the neck down, and set my age range to 45+. I swiped right on men that appeared to be married and successful, and occasionally on the single successful guy.\n\nWithin hours I had more matches than I could handle. I unmatched anyone with low effort messages (a majority of them) and also with anyone who sent a message asking to *meet right now*. I was left with very few, but mostly promising, matches. Over the course of the next few hours I managed to whittle my entire list down to one match either due to a mismatch in expectations or general likability. My final match hadn't yet messaged, so I decided to reach out first.\n\nThis particular match did not have a face photo, but he had a photo from his neck to his knees, on what appeared to be a very nice boat. I wasn't thrilled about this particular match having only one photo but the thing is, I like boats. I know almost nothing about them, and I could probably never help upkeep one, but I love them all the same. I was literally feeling the salty wind in my hair as I reached out and sent my first message to my new POT.\n\nIt took a few hours, but he finally responded. \"I'm sorry for my delay in reply,\" he wrote. \"I've been in the Hamptons on the boat. I just returned to the city.\"\n\nWe got to know each other over the course of messaging through the app. He's a physicist that is currently in New York for work. He's writing a novel part time and his wife lives on the West Coast for the time being. He's vague in regards to his line of work, not expanding on who he works for or what exactly he does, but being used to the OPSEC required for use on Seeking Arrangements I don't give any of it much thought. Besides, I don't really even know what a physicist does. A google search makes it sound interesting. And, well, he's got a boat.\n\nI run the cell phone number he eventually gives to me through google and turn up nothing. We agree to exchange more photos and he sends over a slightly grainy photo of a man appearing to be in his late forties, with very blonde hair, and a body on the thinner side. He's not atrocious looking. He sends me a photo of the view from his apartment in Manhattan, and also a photo of his cat. All completely normal. I waffle on discussing sugar dating and an allowance, but since I tend to drive my relationships more organically, I refrain. Everything he's shown me and told me matches up with what I'm looking for in a potential partner, including his mention of how he likes to \"spoil women\".\n\nOn his recommendation we agree to meet at a wine bar in an affluent shopping mall in New York City. I am floored at my luck and google the shops located within the mall. I plan my arrival early so I can do some recon on the shopping situation, but upon arrival find that there is almost zero parking within a two block radius. After much frustration, I finally find street parking a few blocks away. By the time I've completed my walk the stilettos I am wearing have cut blisters into the backs of my heels. When I arrive to the mall, I beeline to the window of Prada and check out the goodies quickly, before heading over to the wine bar. I am officially late.\n\nI walk into the bar and scan the tables for my date. I don't find him and thank my lucky stars that he is also tardy. I take a seat outside the wine bar on a bench, secretly checking out the jewelry in the display across from me. Eventually, my phone rings. I answer and he asks me if I've been detained. It's the first time we've spoken on the phone and his voice sounds funny, higher pitched than I'd expected. I tell him I'm outside and that I'd looked in the bar but hadn't seen him. He tells me to come back inside and as I do I see a man gesturing frantically from one of the front high-tops. \n\nThis man is not the man I'd agreed to meet. Or, at least, he hasn't been in a few decades. This man's hair is no longer blonde, it's now white, from age. It's thinning and sticks out all over his head like he's been electrocuted, or like someone just rubbed a balloon all over him and the static still remains. He's much thinner than in the photo, his skin clinging to his bones like he'd recently walked through the desert and returned dehydrated and with massive muscle loss. When he shook my hand his longer than normal fingernails scraped my wrist.\n\n\"Were you doing some window shopping?\" he asks, his eyebrows raised. I shrug in response, hoping to appear coy.\n\nI sit down, thinking I've been catfished, but upon searching his face realize this man is most likely the one in the photo, just quite a bit later on in life. I am annoyed but figure I might as well give him a chance. I order a glass of white wine and he gives me the stink eye over the top of the menu while he orders a glass of water. It's 4pm and we're at a wine bar. I shrug it off and he asks me if I want food. I tell him I'll happily split an appetizer but I'm not terribly hungry at the moment. He ignores my request for an appetizer and orders a meal for himself. The waitress gives me a funny look.\n\nConversation doesn't flow easily and I try to jump start it while sipping my wine. He's wearing a polo and I can't help but notice that his veins are visible through his paper-like, pasty skin. My stomach begins to turn as he laments about his time on Tinder, how many women he's met, and what has become of each encounter. He uses the phrase 'friends with benefits' too much. He becomes animated when I mention I've spent time in the BDSM scene. He launches into a reimagining of his recent delve into dominating a younger woman at an orgy and I stifle a laugh thinking about him wearing leather and trying to wield a paddle with his non-existent biceps. I begin to wonder if there is a fetish for being finger-banged by a man with dagger-talons. Does he visit a manicurist to get them so rounded?\n\nWords begin to flow freely from his mouth and I'm brought back from my mental mockery when he says, \"and that's how I spoil my women.\"\n\nThinking I've somehow missed the cue for us to go shopping I try to backtrack the conversation in my mind. We were definitely talking about sex and not presents. Giving up my attempt to not seem dense I say, \"How do you spoil your women again?\"\n\nHe winks at me but instead of his eyelid coming down, his nose and cheek go up to meet his forehead, and his mouth gapes open all creepy like. His face appears contorted when he winks. \"I'm an animal in bed.\" He says. \"My women orgasm, on average, at least ten times.\"\n\nI feel like vomiting from his usage of 'my women' and immediately search out the waitress while chugging the rest of my wine. Screw shopping. I need a fast exit. He ignores my obvious distress and changes the subject.\n\n\"Have you ever seen Gattaca?\"\n\nI'm confused at the topic change. My back hurts like I've just suffered from a case of whip lash. I can feel my cheeks and neck getting hot, which is what happens when I get embarrassed or upset. If I don't calm down soon, I'll break out in hives. I briefly debate ordering another wine. Instead, I stupidly affirm that I have, in fact, seen Gattaca.\n\n\"Aliens are real.\" He says deadpan. In retrospect, there isn't any other way to announce that aliens are real. If you say it all wide eyed with your voice at an alarming decibel you'll get sent off to the looney bin. Considering this man's voice is already a few octaves too high for an XY chromosome, he has no other choice but to announce that lifeforms outside of this earth exist as if he's announcing the weather. *It's raining and there is a chance of sun later today. High of sixty. Oh and flying saucers exist.*\n\n\"Aliens?\" This is me, trying to find the waitress again. I need a shot. Something strong, like absinthe. Maybe they have edibles at this wine bar. I'm trying to keep my eyebrows from lifting into my hairline. \"Aliens are real?\"\n\n\"In Gattaca, Ethan Hawke is genetically inferior,\" he becomes animated while he speaks. \"In the movie, parents can genetically engineer their children to be better, but Ethan Hawke is not engineered. He's just a regular boy. But these other children, the genetically engineered ones, they have higher intelligence, better bodies. Eugenics.\" \n\nI am trying to keep up, even though the whole date is beginning to take a bit of a surreal quality around the edges. I begin to wonder if he slipped something into my drink. My neck feels like it's on fire and my cheeks are burning. He's stopped talking and I realize I'm supposed to answer.\n\n\"Eugenics. Right. I'm German. So, like, selective breeding?\"\n\nHe shakes his head empathically. I guess I haven't been keeping up after all. \"Not breeding. The aliens come here and insert genetically modified DNA into humans.\" His hands make saucer shapes in the air, he zips the finger saucers to and fro in the air as he speaks. \"They help move evolution along.\"\n\nI'm pretty certain I'm being punked at this point so I stand up from the table. \"I have to use the restroom.\" I grab my purse and make a beeline for the bathroom, searching for an exit on the way. I have never ditched a date in my life but I certainly plan to now. There is no back entrance, or side entrance. The only one is the door directly in front of our table. I won't be able to slip out without him seeing me do so. I stand in the bathroom and contemplate whether my bill for my drink will get paid. I check the mirror and see that hives are breaking out along my neck and chest. I take a Benadryl from my purse and down it using water from the sink. I cower in a stall for a bit before I decide to go back out and make an excuse for a hasty exit. I have no idea how long I've been gone.\n\nWhen I return to the table and sit back down he becomes animated again, his arms flailing as he speaks. It dawns on me that this man looks exactly like Einstein, crazy white hair and all. I giggle to myself when I think this, a short reprieve from the yucky-boiling-feeling in my gut. He explains how the aliens come to earth, either as experiment or means to assist us in survival, and genetically mutate humans. I debate asking him if he thinks he's been mutated but instead I blurt out the next best thing, \"Like the X-men? Evolution skips ahead, people become mutants.\" \n\n\"Yes!\" He yells, pounding his fists on the table. Our cutlery clinks around and my wine glass wobbles. The waitress finally takes notice and begins rushing over to our table. My date leans in close, I can smell the garlic from his lunch on his breath. \"Mutants are real. Mutants are very real.\" He whispers.\n\nThe waitress arrives and asks us if we want anything else. I shake my head, unable to articulate words. I feel like I'm suffering from tunnel vision. She lays the bill on the table and walks away. \"So, where to next?\" He asks me. His face is contorted because he's making the weird winky eye again. I'm now positive he's a mutant, but the not the sexy clawed Wolverine kind. That kind, I'd be okay with.\n\n\"I think I'm going to go home.\" I say.\n\nHe face morphs into one of confusion. \"I thought maybe we'd take a trip to the Hamptons...\"\n\nI hesitate, because, you know, boats.\n\n\"My friend would love to meet you. It's his boat. But he doesn't mind if I come over from time to time. I bring the girls. You don't mind driving do you?\"\n\nMy brain works slowly, catching up with the present, anger begins to bubble in my veins. A waking nightmare of a forced orgy at sea with a man that looks like Einstein and another man that looks like the Gimp from pulp fiction flits through my mind. *Bring out the Gimp!* reverberates in my brain. I manage to squeak out, \"It's... not your boat?\"\n\nHe shakes his head while glancing down at the bill. \"Okay... Your wine costs twelve dollars, so you owe....\"\n\nI see red and it drowns out the rest of his words. A waiter, not ours, passes by and I grab his shoulder, while digging in my wallet. I'm irate and I might be screaming. \"THIS GUY SAYS MY DRINK WAS TWELVE DOLLARS.\" I throw a twenty onto the waiters bussing tray. \"KEEP THE CHANGE.\"\n\nI run out the door without looking back. I walk in circles not remembering where I'd left my car. I'm confused and my limbs feel heavy. It begins to downpour and I don't have an umbrella. I squint at my phone, the google map pin point blinks at me showing me where I'd left my car, but I can't seem to find it. Nothing looks familiar. Eventually, I back track to the mall, remove my shoes and walk barefoot through New York City, back the way I came, with my ankle blisters bleeding onto the concrete. \n\nI finally find my car. I'm soaked straight through to my bra, my feet and ankles are covered in dirt and god-knows what. Premium denim is really heavy when it's wet. I'm too tired to drive myself home so I crawl into the back seat, my chest and neck itching like mad. I take another Benadryl and fall asleep listening to the rain pound down on the roof of my car. The rushing water sounds almost like being out to sea. \n\nI deleted Sugar Tinder^(TM) from my phone upon return home. Also, Sugar Tinder^(TM) is not a thing. You've been warned.",

Unfortunately, if you write those words you'll get reported and booted off and it's hard to do it all covert.
