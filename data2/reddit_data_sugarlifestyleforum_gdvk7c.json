    "body": "First time poster so please bear with me. \n\nI am talking to a POT from SA that is more or less in my area. He invited me over to his house to meet \u201cbecause of the virus\u201d but got upset when I said that we could just talk until things opened back up. We live in opposite directions of the main city so a drive to his house would be an hour and a half whereas a drive to the city is maybe 45 minutes. I offered to do a quick little M&G at a restaurant in the city and eat in the car or outside instead and he became even more upset with that. His response was: \u201cI won\u2019t kidnap or kill you. I am just trying to be nice. Why tf would I want to eat in my car or at a park when I have a beautiful house and wine to share?\u201d then goes on to talk about how he will even pay XXX for me to come to his house for a platonic M&G so I \u201cfeel better about it.\u201d \n\nI am curious on how I should proceed. Going to his house is not even an option. I know better than to meet at someone\u2019s house. If he does come around to doing the M&G in the city, should I still be worried that he is disregarding my concerns for my safety and thinks that throwing out a nice number will change my mind?",

I\u2019d personally reply with something along these lines and then stop responding. If he comes back in a week or two then you know you stood your ground and he respects that. \u201cUnfortunately it appears we may not have the same priorities. To me, my safety and comfort must come first if I want to be able to meet my partners needs. I want my SD to be happy so it would be irresponsible of me to go into an arrangement if I had any reservations about my ability to do that because I know I might be holding back. If you change your mind and are willing to make a small sacrifices for our initial meet, please let me know and we can schedule something. Otherwise I wish you the best of luck in your search.\u201d",
