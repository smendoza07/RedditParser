Blind Madara no diff one shotted that Sasuke.\n\nDefinitely not. Sasuke now doesn't have a rinnegan but he still has his own gains he's made over the years(via training) and six paths chakra. He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Kaguya had Hagoromo and Hamura with an unnamed villager. Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes. Definitely not a lot though. He most likely has the orbs because of the Tenseigan, or he lucked out like Yamato did.",

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki. And all enemies they've fought since the war were Otsutsuki. \n\n>A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2).\n\nThat Kaguya instance was a very specific situation where he used that tactic because he was hiding behind the big body of clones trying to get close to her, a tactic we probably won't see him use ever again. He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki.

Plus the beasts were only ever in the statue if they werent in their jinchuriki's until that point vs Madara too.\n\nI would just say no one else physically *could* do that but Sasuke, both due to power and timing",

While all that being said i did like the emo bitch ass story ngl",

Naruto trains with actual masters and sennin while Sasuke is literally \"hey you killed your brother, take his eyes and all his abilities\" or \"im the god of shinobi, I'mma give you the same eyes I have, no explanation or training\"\n\nEven then he kept up with Naruto at his own pace.

I felt like as his character it would make more sense if he didn\u2019t just judge things based on the surface. Or maybe if he just didn\u2019t go with orochimaru and stayed in the village, got older, maybe he would\u2019ve been included in the itachi infiltration secret which could have prevented all that extra crap. Also with him supposed to be being cool, calm, collected, and smart. You\u2019d think he would find it weird itachi massacred his village and try to dig deeper into the truth that being his goal rather than just jumping to killing him. I mean I get at the beginning since he was traumatized and people take trauma differently but like as he grew older I don\u2019t understand why he never tried to find out why itachi did it or the truth about it since his character is supposed to be calm, collected, and all that crap. That\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t like sasuke but like I don\u2019t really care bout him now.",

He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes.

Truthseeking orbs are one of the strongest abilities in naruto, in all honesty.\n\nYeah, but so are his own jutsu, and his own forms. He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki. And all enemies they've fought since the war were Otsutsuki. \n\n>A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2).\n\nThat Kaguya instance was a very specific situation where he used that tactic because he was hiding behind the big body of clones trying to get close to her, a tactic we probably won't see him use ever again. He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki.

While all that being said i did like the emo bitch ass story ngl",

He kinda just spams Amaterasu untop of other attacks or Susano.\n\nAlso it's unfair again because what Shippuden happens in a year? Naruto trains with actual masters and sennin while Sasuke is literally \"hey you killed your brother, take his eyes and all his abilities\" or \"im the god of shinobi, I'mma give you the same eyes I have, no explanation or training\"\n\nEven then he kept up with Naruto at his own pace.

He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Kaguya had Hagoromo and Hamura with an unnamed villager. Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes. Definitely not a lot though. He most likely has the orbs because of the Tenseigan, or he lucked out like Yamato did.",

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki. And all enemies they've fought since the war were Otsutsuki. \n\n>A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2).\n\nThat Kaguya instance was a very specific situation where he used that tactic because he was hiding behind the big body of clones trying to get close to her, a tactic we probably won't see him use ever again. He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything.

Sasuke's Rinnegan was definitely stronger because of the Otsusuki Sage Chakra that he got, and you can tell that by the markings in his Rinnegan vs theirs which were just the lines. Madara wanted to absorb them into the 10 tails and become the jinchuriki so the most he ever had to do was when he used the Gedo chains to grab them all. Plus the beasts were only ever in the statue if they werent in their jinchuriki's until that point vs Madara too.\n\nI would just say no one else physically *could* do that but Sasuke, both due to power and timing",

He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously).

Truthseeking orbs are not simply a result of a Kekkai Mora, because Naruto, Obito, and Madara have their own respective chakra affinities. \n\nThe only known users to *create* (and not simply command) more Truthseeking orbs are Hamura and Hagoromo. Hagoromo and Hamura, without a doubt, has an affinity for all chakra natures, since they practically created them. \n\nBut how about Kaguya? She doesn\u2019t have truthseeking orbs. She instead had access to the Bone Ash jutsu that killed Obito. \n\nThis leads me to believe that Hagoromo and Hamura are able to create orbs because they\u2019re siblings, much like how Sasuke and Itachi have access to Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu, but not Kamui for example. \n\nKekkai Mora qualities, but invariably a SoSP/Otsutsuki ability.",

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki.

He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything.

Blind Madara no diff one shotted that Sasuke.\n\nDefinitely not. Sasuke now doesn't have a rinnegan but he still has his own gains he's made over the years(via training) and six paths chakra. He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes.

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki. And all enemies they've fought since the war were Otsutsuki. \n\n>A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2).\n\nThat Kaguya instance was a very specific situation where he used that tactic because he was hiding behind the big body of clones trying to get close to her, a tactic we probably won't see him use ever again. He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki.

Sasuke now doesn't have a rinnegan but he still has his own gains he's made over the years(via training) and six paths chakra. He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Kaguya had Hagoromo and Hamura with an unnamed villager. Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes.

Truthseeking orbs are one of the strongest abilities in naruto, in all honesty. A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2). My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki. Being able to use six paths senjutsu and some of the power of a ten tails jinchuuriki, he was granted the ability to use a certain number of truthseekers. But I do think that he can\u2019t regenerate the orbs and manifesting them only happens the one time you gain all of the bijuu\u2019s chakra, as we see that he doesn\u2019t have the orbs when fighting sasuke after the indra\u2019s arrow bijuu rasenshuriken explosion that wasted most of their energy and caused them to resort to them using brute taijutsu on the brink of exhaustion. It would make sense that truthseekers were one offs, since we don\u2019t see naruto with truthseekers any time after they disappeared post-valley of the end explosion.",

Truthseeking orbs are one of the strongest abilities in naruto, in all honesty.\n\nYeah, but so are his own jutsu, and his own forms. He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki. And all enemies they've fought since the war were Otsutsuki. \n\n>A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2).\n\nThat Kaguya instance was a very specific situation where he used that tactic because he was hiding behind the big body of clones trying to get close to her, a tactic we probably won't see him use ever again. He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki. Being able to use six paths senjutsu and some of the power of a ten tails jinchuuriki, he was granted the ability to use a certain number of truthseekers. But I do think that he can\u2019t regenerate the orbs and manifesting them only happens the one time you gain all of the bijuu\u2019s chakra, as we see that he doesn\u2019t have the orbs when fighting sasuke after the indra\u2019s arrow bijuu rasenshuriken explosion that wasted most of their energy and caused them to resort to them using brute taijutsu on the brink of exhaustion. It would make sense that truthseekers were one offs, since we don\u2019t see naruto with truthseekers any time after they disappeared post-valley of the end explosion.\n\nYeah, maybe.",

He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes.

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki.

He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything.

He and Naruto both acquired six paths chakra from Hagoromo upon resurrection but Naruto was given spsm, and Sasuke got the rinnesharingan. \n\nIt's honestly safe to say Adult base Sasuke is stronger than yet comparable to EOS Sasuke, given both Naruto and Sasuke as adults are now casually comparable to Otsutsuki in their base forms. Naruto didn't even really need to try in order to shit on Toneri, he reacted to FUSED Momoshiki in base and then one shotted him with a base form massive rasengan, Sasuke was casually swapping hands with fucking Kinshiki Otsutsuki with the 3 tomoe sharingan while fatigued(granted he had the rinnegan at the time, which ofc passively buffs). \n\nPeople really underestimate the growth Naruto and Sasuke made post war. It's been about 15 years since then, Naruto and Sasuke didn't just sit on their asses the entire time(though when Naruto became Hokage, which happened several years after the war I'm sure you know since Kakashi became the 6th Hokage, he got a bit rusty -- but rusty =/= weaker obviously). That's completely out of character, and Naruto and Sasuke are still Shinobi.",

Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes. Definitely not a lot though. He most likely has the orbs because of the Tenseigan, or he lucked out like Yamato did.",

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki.

He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything.

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki.

He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki.

Truthseeking orbs are not simply a result of a Kekkai Mora, because Naruto, Obito, and Madara have their own respective chakra affinities. \n\nThe only known users to *create* (and not simply command) more Truthseeking orbs are Hamura and Hagoromo. Hagoromo and Hamura, without a doubt, has an affinity for all chakra natures, since they practically created them. \n\nBut how about Kaguya? She doesn\u2019t have truthseeking orbs. She instead had access to the Bone Ash jutsu that killed Obito. \n\nThis leads me to believe that Hagoromo and Hamura are able to create orbs because they\u2019re siblings, much like how Sasuke and Itachi have access to Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu, but not Kamui for example. \n\nKekkai Mora qualities, but invariably a SoSP/Otsutsuki ability.",

Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes.

He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki.

He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki.

Therefore, their Otsutsuki lineage is more diluted. The result? Hagoromo\u2019s descendants can unlock the Sharingan. Hamura\u2019s descendants can unlock the Byakugan. \n\nToneri is not a direct descendant of Hagoromo, but he\u2019s a descendent of Hamura, which means Toneri and Hagoromo share some of the same genes. Definitely not a lot though. He most likely has the orbs because of the Tenseigan, or he lucked out like Yamato did.",

Truthseeking orbs are one of the strongest abilities in naruto, in all honesty.\n\nYeah, but so are his own jutsu, and his own forms. He clearly never needed to really use them since the war especially against Otsutsuki since they're pretty much useless aginst Otsutsuki(Otsutsuki with absorption/shrinking abilities on top of that) unless used as weapons like a staff. They're OP against humans, not Otsutsuki. And all enemies they've fought since the war were Otsutsuki. \n\n>A touch kills any regular human, it\u2019s essentially invincible to all attacks besides sage attacks, and naruto could use it very strategically, such as giving truthseekers to a clone like he did with kaguya to distract enemies or allowing sasuke a free item to use amenotejikara with (which sasuke did to get behind naruto in Valley of the end pt 2).\n\nThat Kaguya instance was a very specific situation where he used that tactic because he was hiding behind the big body of clones trying to get close to her, a tactic we probably won't see him use ever again. He clearly uses his clones much more efficiently now. And Sasuke's switch teleport only helps but so much lmao. If it doesn't work without the truthseeking orbs using them won't change anything. And Naruto still doesn't need to waste orbs for this strat when he can simply use clones.\n\n>My guess is that naruto has truthseekers because he possessed the power of all bijuu at one point, making him a tseudo-ten tails jinchuuriki. Being able to use six paths senjutsu and some of the power of a ten tails jinchuuriki, he was granted the ability to use a certain number of truthseekers. But I do think that he can\u2019t regenerate the orbs and manifesting them only happens the one time you gain all of the bijuu\u2019s chakra, as we see that he doesn\u2019t have the orbs when fighting sasuke after the indra\u2019s arrow bijuu rasenshuriken explosion that wasted most of their energy and caused them to resort to them using brute taijutsu on the brink of exhaustion. It would make sense that truthseekers were one offs, since we don\u2019t see naruto with truthseekers any time after they disappeared post-valley of the end explosion.\n\nYeah, maybe.",
