    "body": "The goal of this post is to warn SBs about the potential dangers of sugar dating. Please do not ignore the early signs and stay safe!\n\nI(20f) started sugar dating this past year to support myself through college. I started seeing this new SD(51M) we went on a platonic date before we decided to get intimate. The first time he didn\u2019t want to wear a condom, he said if I didn\u2019t agree for us to have unprotected sex he wasn\u2019t going to pay me. He convinced me that he was clean, he even showed me a recent test result on his phone and he promised to pull out. I didn\u2019t know any better and he was giving me 3 times the ppm that I asked for so I decided to go through with it. Fast forward to our 3rd intimate date, it was just different. He was just pounding in me and when I asked him to stop he did not. It just started to hurt at some point, I tried to fight him but I wasn\u2019t strong enough. He just locked me on the bed and continued assaulting me while telling me that he was paying me more than he should and I have to meet his needs. I didn\u2019t have the energy to fight him anymore I just took it and let him finish he even came inside of me when he was aware that I wasn\u2019t on birth control I had to take an after pill afterward. After he was done I locked myself inside of the bathroom for a few minutes and when I came back he was gone but he left the money. A few days later he reached out and asked to see me again as nothing happened. I\u2019m traumatized from this, I don\u2019t even know what to say or what to do. I\u2019m still in shock that he would do something like this to me, at the same time I can\u2019t stop blaming myself for putting myself in this situation.",

If someone comes here and chooses to disclose on SLF, they should be able to do so without people accusing them of lying etc. You don't believe them then move on to another post. Moving forward I am going to start considering this a Rule #1 violation. It's absolutely ridiculous that we have to continually tell adults it's not appropriate behavior.",

I strongly suggest getting off of reddit (empathy seems to be in short supply) and calling your local crisis line; they can give you some resources to talk to regarding finding support. \n\nI want to stress that you DO NOT owe anybody anything. THERE IS NO PROTOCOL FOR VICTIMS TO TAKE. You never have to file a police report, you never have to take a rape kit. You never have to tell anyone else or feel like you need to warn others. If you WANT to do any of these things, that is fine! But I just want you to know that you don't HAVE to. There is no time-frame, you can take this as slowly as you like. The biggest priority is YOU. We need to do whatever it takes to make sure YOU will be ok. ...and a counselor will be able to help you make a plan to feel ok again.\n\nI hope the pain eases soon.

I\u2019d feel differently if there were an actual angry mob outside of the rapist\u2019s door but no one has yet been harmed by the outrage of internet users with no idea who they are. In fact, chances are so laughably higher that he will face no consequences whatsoever than that he will face excessive consequences that your concern for him seems absurd. There are men who use SA specifically to harm women because they know the already low probability of facing consequences for assault is lesser still meeting a woman from there.",

Some or rather a lot of their 'advice' & bitching is getting women hurt. \n- ALWAYS USE PROTECTION, ALWAYS. This should be a non negotiable. If you dont both want a future and kids together there is no reason not to use protection. STD/I's can kill. Some are not curable. Some cause cancer.   If he pushes for no protection, he's not worth it.\n- Both should get STD/I testing done, some STD/I's can be passed through skin contact. You can get STD/I's in your mouth. Know each others status. Men should ask about detecting hpv. It isnt in a blood test. HPV & herpes are very contagious & stay in your system. \n- Get vacc'd, make sure to talk to your Drs and your partner about it. Covid-HPV-Hepatitis- know each others status.\n- Birth Control, speak to your gyno about it. Men could/should consider getting snipped. We really need better science, its messed up that us ladies have to take on so much more responsibility. Make sure hes aware of risks and stays safe. \n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. There are better people out there. I hope that vile douche is caught. You still have his contact info. Give it to police. Also report him on the platform you used to meet him. Then block him.

I\u2019d feel differently if there were an actual angry mob outside of the rapist\u2019s door but no one has yet been harmed by the outrage of internet users with no idea who they are. In fact, chances are so laughably higher that he will face no consequences whatsoever than that he will face excessive consequences that your concern for him seems absurd.

Dont go accusatory. Leave it open for him to respond to get the confession. IF the police can set something up with her so she can get the confession then agree to meet and he unknowingly walks in and police are there to arrest him. \n\nHe knows what he did was wrong.

It's a shitty situation but one that doesn't seem to have a good solution. \n\nThere won't be any lesson learned from him except maybe to embolden him. He won't be arrested. He likely won't even be questioned. There is no evidence of a rape. None. Then, even if he is questioned, he simply shows that it was a consensual arrangement, that she met him with the intent of having sex and did so willingly, likely with vigorous prior consent, and with a history of consensual sex. Sorry, but the idea that he will suffer any consequences from this is simply not based in reality.",

They have an arrangement to have sex. She gave consent to have sex. She received money for the sex. She was not under in the influence or otherwise unable to give consent. \n\nYes, he raped her. No, that cannot be demonstrated to be the case here without the guy himself directly stating he knew she withdrew consent and continued anyways. This is an impossible case.

Many woman put themselves in dangerous situations for financial gain. And man who try to push and negotiate sexual boundaries are potentially dangerous. A good sexual partner (man or woman) prioritizes their partners well being and comfort over their own individual pleasure. Attempts to bribe someone into sexual activities are not a good sign.\n\nThere are real people behind the computer screen. Please be responsible.",

In fact, chances are so laughably higher that he will face no consequences whatsoever than that he will face excessive consequences that your concern for him seems absurd.

I\u2019d feel differently if there were an actual angry mob outside of the rapist\u2019s door but no one has yet been harmed by the outrage of internet users with no idea who they are. In fact, chances are so laughably higher that he will face no consequences whatsoever than that he will face excessive consequences that your concern for him seems absurd. There are men who use SA specifically to harm women because they know the already low probability of facing consequences for assault is lesser still meeting a woman from there.",

If it\u2019s fake indeed nobody will ever know and accusing people is not going to change anything.\n\nIf the post is not fake they are hurting a innocent person who is traumatized. The \u201cgood\u201d of outing a fake post doesn\u2019t outweighs the \u201cbad\u201d of further traumatizing a innocent girl who experienced intense trauma.\n\nI cant understand how people can be so mean and cold. \n\nWho would benefit from changing the public\u2019s perception? How does anyone benefit from a post life this? It doesn\u2019t benefit SB\u2019s or SD\u2019s? What is the moral of the story? SD\u2019s who offer triple ppm are potentially dangerous? This is so stupid.\n\nI\u2019ve been acuses of faking a post once and I was like\u2026\u2026 I even send people the private message exchange to prove it was real.\nEven if this particular post is not real the history is very plausible and akin to many that happen.\n\nPushy man and man who try to negotiate boundaries are boundaries pushers and are potentially dangerous. Girls get tempted to overlook security for financial gain. This is also not a great idea.\nReal or fake the message behind this post is accurate",
