Most of the participants in those forums migrated from the escort world and see little to no difference between escorts and Sugar Babies.  They \"trade\" contact information of SBs, provide reviews and brag about convincing an SB to have sex for little to no allowance.  Similar to how the female dominated forums create blacklists and discuss ways of maximizing the sugar they get and minimizing the sugar they give. They brag about tricking an SD into providing an allowance when they have no intention of providing sugar.  \n\nThis forum is not perfect and goes through periods where certain groups dominate the discussion, but having a good mix of experienced SDs and SBs participate in the discussion keeps each other honest and provides for the best most honest view of what Sugar Dating can be.",

He was a bible thumper turns out and was trying to \"date\" me and \"help me financially\" but not into an \"arrangement\" on a sugar site? Like did u get lost on the Internet??? \n\nLike absolutely crazy lol I wish I could go back and tell my younger self not to cry bc I know I'm not like that. And even if I was! Who are you to judge?! Why am I defending myself to a stranger. Fragile ego bc he didn't wanna pay to date me so that makes me a whore lol But wanted to move in/work at company. A mess!

He was a bible thumper turns out and was trying to \"date\" me and \"help me financially\" but not into an \"arrangement\" on a sugar site? Like did u get lost on the Internet??? \n\nLike absolutely crazy lol I wish I could go back and tell my younger self not to cry bc I know I'm not like that. And even if I was! Who are you to judge?! Why am I defending myself to a stranger. Fragile ego bc he didn't wanna pay to date me so that makes me a whore lol But wanted to move in/work at company. A mess!

I told him I was looking to have a nice time and new experiences, and for someone to spoil me. He told me he thought I had to much going on. \ud83d\ude05I answered his question and I was straight to the point. I asked for his opinion  (feedback purposes)why he felt like that. He refused to clarify for me. I thought maybe he had a broom stick shoved up where the sun doesn't shine.\ud83e\udd38\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude06 I would rather get real actual feedback.
