I had an SD I flew to once a month and he always had my favorite Starbucks drink in hand and a healthy snack packed for me in the car to eat on the way back to his place. This was so thoughtful as I always had an early flight out to see him and would always miss breakfast. I\u2019d be starvring by the time I got there. I\u2019m also a health nut so it was sweet that he always packed my favorite healthy snacks. This same SD always planned the best day trips and played tour guide to me. I appreciated his thoughtfulness.  \n\nYour turn!",

He also sent me an Amazon gift card with a large sum as a housewarming gift when I moved and I was able to furnish much of my new apartment with that. We had a great SR for 6 months then it all came crashing down. But oh well, I have since moved on and one of my new SDs took me shopping after our m&g then had flowers waiting for me and cooked for me on our first subsequent date and I am super happy with him so far! I love the types who are truly generous, they are so rare and so special!",

Everything from dogs, trees, scenery, food, funny signs, etc.    Even though he now lives several states away, he still sends me these random photos.   \n\nHe also used to give a lot of gifts. Not expensive things, but little things he knew I would adore.    He still does this as well - things just show up in the mail with no warning.   Most recently a Captain Marvel T-shirt when the movie was released because he knows I\u2019m a Marvel nerd.  \n\nMy current guy sends me the sweetest texts. We text daily,  but he always makes a point to be so complimentary, and makes me feel so special and desired.  It\u2019s amazing what words alone can do!   And he indulges me in conversations that zoom waaaay off topic lol.",
