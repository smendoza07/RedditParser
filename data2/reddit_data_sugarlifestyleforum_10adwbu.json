    "body": "I was posting frequently here under another account, which I ended up deleting for reasons I may talk about another post.\n\nBut for all the talk from women here who just wish there were a guy who would take care of them\u2026 somehow I don\u2019t seem to be finding these women in the real world, or even on here.\n\nThe latest SB was 30, professional woman with a good job. I met her on SA. I actually opened up a major career opportunity for her, and I was about to open another one. Like transformational for her career from the minor leagues to the major leagues. \n\nI also bought her high end electronics, gave her a decent allowance, flew her long-haul business & first class, put her up at luxury hotels, gave her a travel allowance on top of the monthly allowance, took her to nice restaurants. She told me her dream was to get tickets to a particular exclusive event and of course I manage the score of them through my connections. If she lasted another month, I would have also paid off all of her outstanding debt. She claimed that the sex was amazing and even unexpectedly good.\n\nSo this was the whole package: mentorship career support, spoiling, financial support, relief of financial anxiety, sexual satisfaction.\n\nFor me, sex was pleasant (nice, but not mind blowing) but all I really needed from her was reliability: show up for dates, don\u2019t disappear in the middle of a text conversation. \n\nApparently, this was too much to ask.\n\nMy dawning realization was that she liked me, but didn\u2019t actually care about me.\n\nMy best POTs at this point just want spoiled gf-style situations. I wasn\u2019t averse to trying an actual sugar style relationship, but none of the women I tried doing that with from SA showed a hint of gratitude or appreciation.\n\nIncluding a couple of efforts to date off of this forum, with women who claimed that they were different. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are appreciative SB\u2019s, but my experience has not been consistent with that. \n\nAnyway, thank you for listening to my rant. I\u2019m trying to keep a positive attitude but I\u2019m pretty annoyed right now because she disappeared on me right before a major trip and unwinding the tickets and housing is a huge hassle.",

Believe me this is coming from an SB that sided with SDs more often than not. But women don\u2019t just walk away from such ideal and amazing arrangements for no reason. Something about it was not ideal for her and she didn\u2019t feel comfortable voicing it to you. \n\nDo you think possibly you may have thrown it in her face just how one sided or skewed in her favor your arrangement was? Did you mayhaps lead on that the sex was not mind blowing? The self respect is strong in some women and although I would never ghost a man I was unhappy or unsatisfied with (that\u2019s lame on her part) I would leave no matter how great if I felt disrespected in any way.",

                    "body": "Yeah, this is a smart take. I was astonished reading the OP as to why anyone would walk away from that, and also disappear right before a trip! You'd expect a flaky young girl to mess up something that good out of impulsivity, but not a 30 year old professional. \n\nBut, you reminded me that sometimes the relational piece of things can get really bad, and one might decide it's unfixable (generally because the other person refuses to listen or change) and that the money isn't worth it. It would also make a lot of sense to leave right before a trip, during which you'll be spending lots of time together with ample room for frustration.\n\nOP, I have no idea what happened with your SB, of course.  I remember walking away from an arrangement when I was 22, though, because of how bad I consistently felt around him. He was one of those attorneys who make arguing their whole personality and I didn't like that dynamic (esp given that I never won! Though things would have gotten even more unpleasant if I had) and didn't like how he would put me down and didn't like that he would predictably get upset with me when I was truly trying my best to make him happy. \n\nThe last straw (I'm sure you didn't do this with your SB, but I include it to illustrate how frustrating things got for me) was when I went to see him one weekend and he started talking about the fact that I am biracial in terms of my \"more dominant-acting White side, and your submissive Asian side.\" My jaw metaphorically dropped and I tried to kindly but firmly tell him that he really shouldn't equate Whiteness with dominance and Asianness with being submissive. He waved me off and insisted that his analysis was correct. \n\nI finished the weekend with him and didn't really think of it as the last weekend at the time, but once I got back home, I realized that the money just wasn't worth it for me. He could have paid me double and it still wouldn't have been worth it. So, I ghosted him. Only time I have ever done that to anyone I've dated. My idea was that talking about things with him would have just led to the mother of all arguments. I know I shouldn't have done it, I should have just sent him a brief message saying it was over and blocked him. That's what I would do now, but it is what it is. \n\nI wonder what your last series of interactions with your SB may have been like? What do you think they might have been like, from her perspective?\n\nUsually, both people contribute to things falling apart somehow. Regardless, I'm sorry that you've been having such crappy experiences in the bowl.",

As soon as she had other opportunities or another guy someone she was probably actually attracted to she disappeared.\n\nAnd did she walk away from it? Or did he end it after feeling disrespected.  Or  did she expect him to accept it because she is hot, and younger and he should be greatful to be with her.\n\nI have had a few great SR with SB who actually like me as a person and want to spend time with me and enjoy the time we spend together, in these sitatuations the SR tends to last much longer as in a couple of years. I have sadly run into people like the SB described by the OP. Someone who never actually liked me as a person and when the opportunity to move on came they did, or the acting was bad and I could see they didn't care about me and I dropped them. \n\nRemember for every amazing SB there are many bad/disengenous/fake people out there. Just like for every good SD there are many cheap/bad/fake people out there.",

I learned my lesson at a certain point and just started paying for my portion of things, but she *still* insisted on paying the whole check sometimes, haha. She was an awesome person- friends like that are very valuable, and I guess if she had always let me pay the tab like I was trying to, then the friendship may have felt a bit different. \n\nI'm sure that when you're actually well off and can invest in someone's business idea, as opposed to just picking up the tab for their sushi, the schemers become thick on the ground and very underhanded in their attempts to get close to you.

I was late to our dates, my mood was never happy around him. I, too, kept telling him that I\u2019ll get better. Granted, it was his own fault that the chemistry left.. if you knew the immature ways he would tell me he wanted sex, it made me gag and feel like an object.",

Alas, the only good she did for me was in her own mind.  I never felt that good, no matter how much she told me it existed.  The last day we were together, I showed up early at her place to pick her up to go tubing. In a paniced voice, she refused to open up the door, saying that I had to leave at once.  I left, and took a walk in the woods drinking a cup of delicious coffee.  On the way home from tubing, she broke up with me complaining that I complained too much.  \n\nShe later said that she wouldnt open the door cause she didnt want me to be upset about her having bought new furniture.  Whatever \ud83d\ude44.\n\nNo matter how into her I was, she had never been into me.  She lied about so very many things.  My subconscious knew this, wouldnt allow my mind to rest which was reflected in my mood and attitude.\n\nAs the final proof of the reality of our relationship, she disrespected me by stealing $2,500 out of my account, cause, \"I owed her.\"  I shit you not, at the moment that I had found out, my finger had been hovering over the send money button, because I wanted to prevent her from experiencing any discomfort.",

Career women are busy\u2014mentally and physically. They have deadlines to meet and ladders to climb. \nI had the opportunity of an experience like this before. Being available for work trips; especially last minute international ones, are no joke. I did it for 2 years, but I had a job I had the privilege of quitting. Career women don\u2019t always have that privilege. \nYou probably need someone in their limbo stage 23-26. They\u2019re done with college and have an hourly job. You seem like you mesh well professionally with a career woman. But the outcome you spoke of above is the possible trade off. A 23-26 might not be super well rounded professionally but she\u2019d be teachable, available, flexible and has the mental capacity to place you at the forefront of her mind.",

Reward good behavior, *but* punish bad ones (don't meet until the next week, be busy, stop texting, remain distant and passive). You gotta approach this from a position of power and strength, not like a little cat who wants milk. \n\nThe best way to do this is to date multiple SBs, because otherwise you'll get attached and she will exploit you and ruin the dynamics of the SR. \n\nYou're paying for this man, not the other way around.",

You'd expect a flaky young girl to mess up something that good out of impulsivity, but not a 30 year old professional. \n\nBut, you reminded me that sometimes the relational piece of things can get really bad, and one might decide it's unfixable (generally because the other person refuses to listen or change) and that the money isn't worth it. It would also make a lot of sense to leave right before a trip, during which you'll be spending lots of time together with ample room for frustration.\n\nOP, I have no idea what happened with your SB, of course.  I remember walking away from an arrangement when I was 22, though, because of how bad I consistently felt around him. He was one of those attorneys who make arguing their whole personality and I didn't like that dynamic (esp given that I never won! Though things would have gotten even more unpleasant if I had) and didn't like how he would put me down and didn't like that he would predictably get upset with me when I was truly trying my best to make him happy. \n\nThe last straw (I'm sure you didn't do this with your SB, but I include it to illustrate how frustrating things got for me) was when I went to see him one weekend and he started talking about the fact that I am biracial in terms of my \"more dominant-acting White side, and your submissive Asian side.\" My jaw metaphorically dropped and I tried to kindly but firmly tell him that he really shouldn't equate Whiteness with dominance and Asianness with being submissive. He waved me off and insisted that his analysis was correct. \n\nI finished the weekend with him and didn't really think of it as the last weekend at the time, but once I got back home, I realized that the money just wasn't worth it for me. He could have paid me double and it still wouldn't have been worth it. So, I ghosted him. Only time I have ever done that to anyone I've dated. My idea was that talking about things with him would have just led to the mother of all arguments. I know I shouldn't have done it, I should have just sent him a brief message saying it was over and blocked him. That's what I would do now, but it is what it is. \n\nI wonder what your last series of interactions with your SB may have been like? What do you think they might have been like, from her perspective?\n\nUsually, both people contribute to things falling apart somehow. Regardless, I'm sorry that you've been having such crappy experiences in the bowl.",

She was an awesome person- friends like that are very valuable, and I guess if she had always let me pay the tab like I was trying to, then the friendship may have felt a bit different. \n\nI'm sure that when you're actually well off and can invest in someone's business idea, as opposed to just picking up the tab for their sushi, the schemers become thick on the ground and very underhanded in their attempts to get close to you.

I say this because when I see men argue in favor of paying less to SBs in various situations (a common one is travel allowance), they often make the point that she's not actually working for the money, but instead is getting paid to be herself and hang out with someone she likes. Even if the second part of that is true, though, the first part is not.",

You would be surprised of the catfishing I've seen on MGs. \n\nAnd it is not a fantasy for me, I like ordinary girls which I would date vanilla as well. That my taste. Never had a thing for the bombshells 6 foot tall model. Been there done that and not my cup of tea.\n\nI know we're a moving ATM I just wish that sbs don't just see us like that because it doesn't last on the long run. Allowance in my opinion it's there to stimulate the relationship and make her life easier. Sadly lots of sbs see this as a job and that is fine plenty of men like that.

I learned my lesson at a certain point and just started paying for my portion of things, but she *still* insisted on paying the whole check sometimes, haha. She was an awesome person- friends like that are very valuable, and I guess if she had always let me pay the tab like I was trying to, then the friendship may have felt a bit different. \n\nI'm sure that when you're actually well off and can invest in someone's business idea, as opposed to just picking up the tab for their sushi, the schemers become thick on the ground and very underhanded in their attempts to get close to you. I've heard that this is the main reason wealthy folks tend to hang out with each other. Seems frustrating and lonely to have reason not to trust nice people who seem to like you.",

I say this because when I see men argue in favor of paying less to SBs in various situations (a common one is travel allowance), they often make the point that she's not actually working for the money, but instead is getting paid to be herself and hang out with someone she likes.

I say this because when I see men argue in favor of paying less to SBs in various situations (a common one is travel allowance), they often make the point that she's not actually working for the money, but instead is getting paid to be herself and hang out with someone she likes. Even if the second part of that is true, though, the first part is not.",

You would be surprised of the catfishing I've seen on MGs. \n\nAnd it is not a fantasy for me, I like ordinary girls which I would date vanilla as well. That my taste. Never had a thing for the bombshells 6 foot tall model. Been there done that and not my cup of tea.\n\nI know we're a moving ATM I just wish that sbs don't just see us like that because it doesn't last on the long run. Allowance in my opinion it's there to stimulate the relationship and make her life easier. Sadly lots of sbs see this as a job and that is fine plenty of men like that.
