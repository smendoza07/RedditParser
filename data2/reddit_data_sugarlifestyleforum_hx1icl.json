    "body": "I another thread, I told a POT SB complaining about the lack of quality SD's \"There are many supportive, caring, mentoring, appreciative, and generous SD's out there. We are just not easy to spot. Look for the ones a little older. Us granddaddies can be great sugar daddies.\"\n\nThe comment got me thinking about my interaction with my SB's over the last 15 or so years. After my own children and grandchildren, my sugar babies are the best thing to ever happen to me. They have brought such joy into my life. Made my senior years the best of my life.\n\nI love seeing the world through their eyes. Their excitement at the things that are old hat to me. You ladies have made me appreciate my world and my life in ways I could not have imagined. So ladies, don't give up. Know that us SD's need you at least as much as you need us. Keep looking. We are out there.",

Almost all of the SD\u2019s that hit me up are on the \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be transactional\u201d or they will hit me up and start dirty talking and call me a money crazed b*tch when I politely express that I\u2019m not comfortable talking about those things unless we have some form of arrangement or understanding laid out. They say that they don\u2019t want PPM\u2019s but then say that they can\u2019t \u201ctrust me enough\u201d yet to give an allowance -__-. And then they say I am also not the \u201cideal\u201d SB, and tell me that I\u2019m not worthy enough to be an SB because I\u2019m AA :/... so yeah, these SD\u2019s have all been wack and I hope our hard work pays off.",

Not sure why they are registered on a sugar dating site yet disagree with everything associated with sugar dating. They are time wasters with zero to offer in benefits. I've interacted with many idiots. Also they have no photo yet quick to want to see our private images and disappear when you challenge them. I believe lots of them are time wasters enjoying paying a membership fee to pass time. I can think of better things to do!",

But I found two great sb\u2019s recently.    One doesn\u2019t want money (but lots of gifts and holidays).   The other more about the money as she\u2019s saving for a masters.   Both get lots of sugar.    So there are people out there.   Persevere and be focused on what you are looking for.",

Unfortunately I have not seen any evidence of such benefits. I pay for my own things and he only drives me to locations I'm unable to get to. Not very good at all.

My last SR was platonic (again, pure luck). I\u2019m nearly 30, POC, indicated \u201ccurvy\u201d on my profile and have private photos which were simply full face photos. I prefer discretion. With that being said, I found a legit SD that I am attracted to, had a m&g, and had a successful first date within 3weeks. Again, I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE NORM in the bowl. My point in stating this is to remind SBs to stay positive and don\u2019t be discouraged. I see so many of you counting yourself out because you don\u2019t fit the 20 year old skinny Barbie looking girl and you shouldn\u2019t. Sometimes we are our own biggest enemy. \nFor every quality that you think is putting you at a disadvantage, there is someone that is into it. Confidence is key. Know what you want and be able to verbalize it. Create a profile that truly reflects YOU. Being genuine, confident and firm in your requirements will weed out a lot of scammers. I know that it\u2019s easier said than done but defining your wants and needs and standing firm in that will take you far. Good luck to all you beautiful ladies!",

My first m&ms went really well and things seemed to go nice so we decided to meet at his house for the second or well I guess first date since m&g is like an interview. Well at the m&g we discussed allowances and things we were and weren\u2019t comfortable. The man was extremely handsome and I was attracted to him. I told him that sex wasn\u2019t off the table but I wanted to wait a few dates and us both be tested for std\u2019s and I even said I don\u2019t expect an allowance or anything for just going on dates. But he insisted and said at our first date (the one at his house) he would give me 100. Well I came over for dinner and a movie and he ended up sexually assaulting me and stealing my wallet. So I don\u2019t know if I should continue in this world or not anymore",
