    "body": "https://imgur.com/a/79vnvfQ\n\nBefore I got into the bowl, I thought all SBs looked like the girl on the left in the photo. And of course, some of them do, but what I\u2019ve learned is that there is demand for all kinds of women in the bowl. With that being said, we get a lot of questions like \u201cI have XYZ body characteristic, will I be successful in the bowl?\u201d But no one ever tells anyone what successful SB\u2019s actually look like, so you have no point of reference. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have some success in the bowl, so I wanted to post a picture of myself to give some perspective and hopefully encourage anyone who thinks/feels like I did (that they don\u2019t have a chance!) before I got into the bowl. If I can ever help you in any way, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out! Always happy to spread good vibes and positivity and kindness and have conversations with advice or otherwise.",

She responded and I explained I would be making several trips to Florida to her town over the next year. 2018 a total of 16 week long trips for business. I traded my pic and she was interested. I\u2019m 45M, over 6ft and no six pack abs. Still she was interested. We spoke on the phone she 24f and really hit it off. We agreed on the arrangement and enjoyed 16 fun filled weeks, mostly evenings of dinner but a few weekends of her showing me around her town and plenty of beach time. She dressed like a model every time we were together. I was amazed at how she had learned to put her best self forward all the time. Ironically she didn\u2019t see herself as confident.Normally I would have assumed the girl on the left would not be interested in a good ole country gentleman but she luved being treated like a southern belle and we are goods friends now. I just need to land another project in Florida.",

We are also not talking about location, expectations, etc - which cause further variances.  But at its' most basic level - slim, fit, conventionally attractive women - of all races - have success.  \n\nNow, if we start talking overweight/curvy, do white women have an advantage?  I don't know.  I think when you start talking that body type - ALL women have difficulty.",

Looking at that picture the thought that enters my mind is that she's high maintenance, others will make their own judgements. Clothes do ultimately say a lot about a person, especially women because women have soooo much more choice in what they wear (sure a man can wear cyberpunk clothes but its not socially acceptable).\n\nIts rather silly when you object to men saying they'd prefer you for valid reasons isnt it?",

They have ranged from decent looking to 10+ and the ones that have stayed in my memories are the ones with real personality.  I had the pleasure of having an arrangement with one that was one of those 10+'s but after meeting her I realized that her best quality was the chemistry that we had.  She messaged me one day, we met the next and it was like we knew each other our entire lives.  It was the perfect arrangement.  I met one other that was very close and we had a great time but she went flaky over Covid 19 so there went that one. I've met others in this same category (10+) that had the personality of a lamp post.  They believed that a pretty face was all it took and they were wrong.  I've met some that were average in the looks department at best but they also were great fun and interesting to talk to.  To me that's the most important part.  SB's need to realize this and know that looks aren't everything, it takes more, at least for me it does.",

My impression is that she is not someone I would want to spend a lot of time with. \n* beautiful dress although my personal preference would have a more subdued print.  I could picture myself on a date with her at a dinner or show. \n* personal preference - I hate her earrings.  My preference is for jewelry to provide a graceful accent and not be a overpowering focal point\n* personal preference - I hate the sunglasses as pictured.  I see sunglasses as a functional tool to be used outside to protect your vision.\n\nBefore I even open her profile I have decided that she would be nice eye candy but our personal preferences would not line up for a long term arrangement.  It would take a strong  profile to change my mind. \n\nMy first impression if the woman on the left. \n\n* she is smiling and looking at the camera (me).  My impression is that she would be fun to spend time with. \n* picture shows her body well. From the one picture I would question how she would look dressed up.  I can picture myself on a casual date with her. \n* she could have picked a better background for the picture. \n\nBefore I open her profile my impression of her is \"the girl next door\".  I definitely would want to open her profile to learn more about her.  I would start from a slightly positive impression.",

We should applaud them for their confidence and love of looking their best.\nAt the same time, we shouldn't beat people up when they don't want to try as hard as everyone else, maybe they're just happy with the way they are and it is not our job to give them crap for it. Instead, if we must say something, we can give them praise for how confident they must be in just being themself, or maybe try to flatter them into trying a new look, but we should not force them to do anything they aren't comfortable with.\n\nMy tits aren't too big, nor too small, my hips are wide, I've got a booty, my thighs are phat as fuck, and I've got a pocket tummy that sticks out...I can barely fit into my pants anymore and I've since had to size up.

We are also not talking about location, expectations, etc - which cause further variances.

I don't know.  I think when you start talking that body type - ALL women have difficulty.",

Clothes do ultimately say a lot about a person, especially women because women have soooo much more choice in what they wear (sure a man can wear cyberpunk clothes but its not socially acceptable).\n\nIts rather silly when you object to men saying they'd prefer you for valid reasons isnt it?",
