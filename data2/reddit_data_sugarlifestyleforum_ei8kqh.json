    "body": "So, there I am, sweaty palms and all in a 45 minute long Uber ride.  I am divulging as much baseball information as I can with the Uber driver before he says that the person that sent the Uber told him I was precious cargo.  Apparently, my POT told him he would tip him well if he got me to my date safely and he thanked him even before he picked me up.  So, so sweet and classy.\n\nAs I enter the sweet little place he picked out, I can tell that he put a lot of thought and effort into the date.  Big smiles all around.  He waits for me to sit before he takes a seat (ugh, how do I already want to kiss him?).  Having worked in the service industry before, I appreciate how kind he is to the staff.  It's the little things.\n\nIt takes no more than five minutes of conversation and laughter before I decide I would gladly sit on his face right then and there if he asked me to.  We laughed the night away and couldn't keep our eyes off each other.  Despite the long and hectic work day and how hungry I was, I forgot all about the delicious food and wine in front of me.  At one point, we just sat there in silence staring and smiling from ear to ear at each other... both just at a loss for words and indulging in each other's presence.  A delicious moment to savor; the kind you want to put in your pocket for a rainy day.\n\nThe rest of the night was as sweet as can be and I am already hoping to see him again ASAP.  In a moment of pause--and because I am a serial what-are-you-thinking?er--he said something like \"it took so many little decisions to get us here... and we just happened to make all the right ones.\" Floodgates.\n\nI already feel so comfortable with him, and I would vanilla date him in a heartbeat.  Cheers to chemistry-filled, easy connections.\n\n2020 is looking fantastic.  I just want to share with you all how grateful I am for this community!  Without it, I wouldn't have reactivated my account and found this amazing POT I had an incredible date with last night.\n\nHappy New Year, loves!",
