Hiruzen gave him financially and education support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>spoiled milk most of the time\n\nYou mean one time where Naruto drink that milk on his own mistake? Naruto said himself he loves ramen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> All while being super cold and distant, and at times kinda mean, to that orphaned and bullied kid\n\nI suppose you mean just fillers.  \nHell, in the very same fillers we see Hiruzen also being the only one [spending free time](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9d/22/d0/9d22d040fa1ae271d304222fb0c74942.jpg) with Naruto. \n\nIn canon, Naruto in childhood was neglected/ignored. Not bullied.  \n(with some [inconsistency](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0154-014.png) with sometimes being [friends](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0154-015.png) with Shikamaru/kiba/Choji)\n\nHiruzen can't force people to love Naruto.  \nAnd before you say \"what about Konohmaru? he got Ebisu\"  \nWhat were first thought of Ebisu when he saw Naruto?\n\n\"there he is, that fox demon child\"\n\nPeople were afraid of what Naruto has inside him. Which clan would take him? Third can't change human nature.",

Not bullied.  \n(with some [inconsistency](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0154-014.png) with sometimes being [friends](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0154-015.png) with Shikamaru/kiba/Choji)\n\nHiruzen can't force people to love Naruto.  \nAnd before you say \"what about Konohmaru? he got Ebisu\"  \nWhat were first thought of Ebisu when he saw Naruto?\n\n\"there he is, that fox demon child\"\n\nPeople were afraid of what Naruto has inside him.
