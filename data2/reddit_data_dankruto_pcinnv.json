We also see the Hokage involved with village management decisions, like when Tobirama established an Uchiha police force and when Hiruzen moved the entire Uchiha clan outside of the village walls. \n\nI think the villages are reasonably autonomous within their respective nations. The Feudal Lord appoints the Hokage and is in charge of international affairs (like approving the Shinobi Alliance), but he seems pretty hands off after that. This matches the general notion of feudalism too, various semi-independant lords/nobles whose holdings are granted by a higher lord in exchange for fealty.",

Aside from dealing with the Uchiha issue (which Hiruzen basically didn't do anything for anyway), Hiruzen was mostly just managing shinobi contracts and overseeing the village military/security forces. \n\nNaruto created a time of peace, which meant an explosion of economic and social growth. Populations boomed, technology advanced, and businesses thrived. There was suddenly need for all the traditional services we expect in a modern city: zoning, coordinated waste disposal, building inspection, electrical utility management, large-scale plumbing systems, etc. And that's probably where most of Naruto's paperwork comes from. \n\nTsunade had plenty of paperwork too, but I think most of that was probably backlog from the gap between Hiruzen and Tsunade's terms. That and her desire for radical political changes like abolishing Root (attempting to anyway) and probably reforming the medical ninjutsu school.\n\nEdit: not to say that Naruto is individually reviewing every zoning request (though he might be), just that he's probably the final decisionmaker (probably veto or ratification) for any committee decisions. He's the one who puts the final decisions on the Chunin Exam rules, and I imagine he does the same for any other major decision affecting the village.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her. She wouldn't be able to get a hit in.\n\n\nFor her regeneration we already seen cutting her in half is enough to nearly kill her even with it going.\n\n\n\nTsunade was only impressive when she was first introduced because her ridiculous strength was unheard of. Now that that specific feat isn't all that great I think kakashi easily out classes her.\n\n\nI think kakashi vs hiruzen would be a closer and more fun match.",

It didn\u2019t kill her, but it did defeat her completely. Also, while you are correct that Kakashi\u2019s aim with Kamui isn\u2019t perfect(which isn\u2019t exactly true, you\u2019re basing that off of his first time using it against the most mobile of the akatsuki members, when in reality he\u2019s been able to delicately Kamui tiny rasengan from long distance while moving, along with other similar things of that nature), Kakashi is aware of that weakness. Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance. I\u2019d say she wins 3/5 times, maybe 7/10 at best.",

The fact that it comes from chakra and not really DNA is why (I start to get into fanfic territory after this) I wish that Kekkei Genkai weren't in the story clan locked and instead something you could learn but the clans taught it much better and knew how they worked and usually restricted the info making wood style not just something no one knows but instead really hard to control. With Naruto getting a Sharingan he can't quite use on his own at tier one in the Haku fight and a mangekyo at pain that he also doesn't know how to use.",

Assuming Sasuke was going full speed kakashi would be at least the speed of raikage at that time because Sasuke can go as fast as raikage. At That time pre war. We can only assume kakashi got stronger, more stamina because no more chakra drain. Tsunade literally got split in half and got sewed together I have no doubt war arc kakashi> war arc Tsunade, Boruto kakashi > Boruto Tsunade",

But, jokes aside, the fact that people in this sub think Tsunade(and Sakura) are just \u201cpunch kick regenerate\u201d is absolutely absurd lmao this is one of the legendary sannin, a hokage, and repeatedly proclaimed by just about everyone as the strongest kunoichi of all time. She\u2019s, in canon repeatedly, stated to be as powerful as orochimaru and Jiraiya. Kakashi, as strong as he is, only matches those two at his absolute peak, and even then I don\u2019t if he could beat either of them. \n\nKakashi without the sharingan does not match well against tsunade. I don\u2019t know that he has a jutsu that can defeat her 100 healings, and any of his intelligent trap strategies he repeatedly employs isn\u2019t effective against someone who can break down boulders and buildings with an average punch(by their standards). \n\nLike I said somewhere else, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wipe for either, but I\u2019m pretty sure Tsunade just matches up against kakashi too well for him to beat her more than 40% of the time.",

So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

Jutsu and he's extremely smart, and he doesn't have any chakra problems which he did when he had sharingan. Tsunades only abilities are punch kick and mitotic regeneration in war arc he literally fought seven ninja swordsmen, tanked a hit from ten tails, helped fight Madara and Obito, fought Obito then fought kaguya. sure one punch Tsunade will probably kill kakashi but he jumped outta nowhere and saved Sakura when Sasuke tried to chidori her. Assuming Sasuke was going full speed kakashi would be at least the speed of raikage at that time because Sasuke can go as fast as raikage. At That time pre war. We can only assume kakashi got stronger, more stamina because no more chakra drain. Tsunade literally got split in half and got sewed together I have no doubt war arc kakashi> war arc Tsunade, Boruto kakashi > Boruto Tsunade",

Pain was the perfect counter to Jiraiya but all these dick sucking power scaling retards in fandoms dont understand after 30 years of power scaling that it is not like 10 is higher than 5 but more like pokemon where fire beats grass, grass beats water and water beats fire. Jiraiya was incredibly strong but had an unlucky matchup. And Kakashi would have won against tendo pain by himself like twice in the fight but the first time Pain used the \"Rinnegan plot device\" as I call it where he missed the Chidori and hit the wall and the second time the robo pain took the second hit. Kakashi gets beaten by fucking Uchiha and Senju Gods, by Uzumakis with Rinnegans and whatnot lmao. Its not like he lost against fodder lol. Another example is how Kakashi won against Obito even tho Obito thought of himself tied or little stronger than Itachi lol.",

That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi.

If it comes to destructive power, Tsunade easily has the edge. If it's stamina and chakra reserves, she at least rivals him. If it's defence, her 100 healings could probably last as long as the lightning armour. Her punches were able to destroy Madara's ribcage Susano'o that even an enormous sage mode rasengan couldn't scratch. I imagine she should be able to rip through the lightning armor with that or even bypass it through her nervous system scrambling technique. The only category that poses a significant threat to her is speed, both from his physical movement and black lightning techniques. It's debatable whether or not she could react and at least partially block the techniques even though she's not in the same **movement** speed tier as the raikage. We don't have good scaling to determine how sharp her reflexes are.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo. If you're going to argue with that feat, 4th raikage stopped one of those susanoo with a single hand, so 4th raikage and Tsunade have similar strength.

I will say she does some crazy shit in that fight but they\u2019re really only strength/durability feats. She may have medical analytical abilities but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to combat ability. She has never really shown herself to be strategic, at least in the manga/show. She\u2019s more of a sweeper/tank. Kakashi on the other hand got an asspull strength/stamina/chakra boost in the late war arc. He goes from being unable to fight the pains without completely depleting his chakra to being able to fight the seven ninja swordsmen, and then several tailed beasts (even tanking a blow from one of them), and then obito, and then help in the fight against jubito and then jubimadara and then played a big role in the fight against Kaguya. Hokage Kakashi may not have the sharingan (and arguably may not have the 1000 jutsu tho I personally don\u2019t agree with that), but he should still have the asspull strength/stamina boost (pre DMS perfect Susanoo) and since he no longer has the sharingan, there\u2019s no longer a constant drain on his chakra. I still think Kakashi takes the win. If you look at his fights, he nearly always is a precise fighter who goes out of his way to not make mistakes since he was historically hampered with low stamina/low chakra reserves. He\u2019s not gonna let Tsunade tag him with one of her Susanoo busting punches.\n\nEdit: holy shit my bad for the rant, didn\u2019t realize I wrote so much",

She also nearly got manhandled by Kabuto, which is an argument in itself.\n\n\n>\nKakashi only managed to assist because Obito gifted him DMS. Kakashi gets exactly 0 praise/merit for that because it was literally a random, bs, gifted power up.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's BS it's a feat he had and that has to be taken into consideration when talking strength. You can't just disregard something, becaus you don't like it.\n\n>\nYes, but having sharp analytical skills is extremely helpful in realizing at least partially your opponent's intentions. You can at least partially unravel their plans by carefully observing them.\n\nAnd how do we know she's good at that?? Curing people and quickly analyzing midnight are 2 very different things. Also, if we're talking strategy, Kakashi is literally known for both that and having a Sharingan which can literally analyse quickly!",

Like I said before, we don't have scaling of sufficient quality to determine whether or not she would be able to react despite not being in the same movement speed tier as the raikage. \n\n>And also: she didnt create shit lol. Hashirama created that jutsu and had it active passively all the time stated by Madara and all that without weaving handsigns. \n\nHashirama did not create the 100 healings. The recovery is an innate power in his cells as demonstrated by people who have them grafted (Obito and Madara). In other words, his body did it for him. \n\nIn the end, this just makes Tsunade's feat even more impressive. She managed to perfectly emulate one of the abilities of the \"God of Shinobi\" by developing the 100 healings. That would be the same as Yamato using wood style on the same level as Hashirama for example. \n\n>And \"unrivaled\" during the second war isnt really relevant since there werent tons of strong fighters. \n\nAre you kidding me? The second war had Hanzo, Hiruzen, the 2nd Mizukage and Tsuchikage (maybe), Chiyo, the Uchiha Clan. \n\n>Look at the third world war. Kakashis Father, Chiyo (took over a country by herself lol), Sasukes Father, Minato, A and Bee and most seven swordsmen (who were alive at that point) were also absolute beasts.\n\nSee above. Also how are the seven swordsmen even worth mentioning at all here. Literally all fodder except Kisame.\n\n>Yes Tsunade may be stronger than some\n\nThere we go you said it yourself.",

Just a couple arcs before, he was completely depleted after a fight against the Paths of Pain that lasted maybe five minutes. And now he\u2019s fighting all these strong opponents/boss battles one after the other? Yes his Kamui became stronger and he got more control of it, but the Kamui itself isn\u2019t the reason for his increased abilities, it\u2019s literally just an ability. Dude is legendary; he was able to react to Juubi Madara, a person who was relative to KCM Naruto who casually dodged a laser that was stated to be light speed. Kakashi as a fighter is slept on. Gai never would have done as well as he did if Kakashi hadn\u2019t kamuid everything away from Gai, and that took extremely precise, extremely quick reaction time, precise control of the ability, chakra, and the stamina to do this after having fought against famous ninja, the tailed beasts, and obito/juubito. I\u2019m tired of arguing this so I\u2019m peacing out, thanks for the discussion",

There *were* downsides to Naruto having Kurama before the war arc. He was basically the whole reason Naruto sucked as a ninja. You could argue that if Naruto wasn't being held back like that, he'd be a much smarter fighter.\n\nIn my opinion, he could have been more like Minato and sooner, too, if Kurama wasn't holding him back during his development years(outcast and bad chakra balance).",

Like Might Guy, he says he became stronger since the war, but he's weaker and that's also a fact(until he shows otherwise), dude's missing an entire leg even though his specialty is taijutsu which isn't even as big a loss as a Mangekyo Sharingan, so he's more than likely still in better shape than Kakashi.",

If anything, the sharingan was holding him back because it forced him to rely on it and build his combat techniques around something he has limited affinity for and functionality of. Without it, all the limitations it put on him are gone, freeing up his chakra reserves and encouraging him to develop and refine techniques he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have to. Don\u2019t forget that chidori is an incomplete jutsu, but he never improved it because his sharingan covered up its problems. Without sharingan, he developed the purple version which is much, much more powerful and effective. That\u2019s the kind of improvement you\u2019d see across the board.

He has his own skills like purple lightning but he chooses to over use his sharingan, hence causing his charka to deplete extremely fast. But if he only saved his sharingan for emergency situations he would be the strongest. Because he can easily get out of situations using his 1000 copied Justus when in tight spots but can also just close one eye and use his original jutsus, which is also powerful. So kakashi is not weaker without sharingan, he just overused it",

The Feudal Lord appoints the Hokage and is in charge of international affairs (like approving the Shinobi Alliance), but he seems pretty hands off after that. This matches the general notion of feudalism too, various semi-independant lords/nobles whose holdings are granted by a higher lord in exchange for fealty.",

Aside from dealing with the Uchiha issue (which Hiruzen basically didn't do anything for anyway), Hiruzen was mostly just managing shinobi contracts and overseeing the village military/security forces. \n\nNaruto created a time of peace, which meant an explosion of economic and social growth. Populations boomed, technology advanced, and businesses thrived. There was suddenly need for all the traditional services we expect in a modern city: zoning, coordinated waste disposal, building inspection, electrical utility management, large-scale plumbing systems, etc. And that's probably where most of Naruto's paperwork comes from. \n\nTsunade had plenty of paperwork too, but I think most of that was probably backlog from the gap between Hiruzen and Tsunade's terms. That and her desire for radical political changes like abolishing Root (attempting to anyway) and probably reforming the medical ninjutsu school.\n\nEdit: not to say that Naruto is individually reviewing every zoning request (though he might be), just that he's probably the final decisionmaker (probably veto or ratification) for any committee decisions. He's the one who puts the final decisions on the Chunin Exam rules, and I imagine he does the same for any other major decision affecting the village.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her. She wouldn't be able to get a hit in.\n\n\nFor her regeneration we already seen cutting her in half is enough to nearly kill her even with it going.\n\n\n\nTsunade was only impressive when she was first introduced because her ridiculous strength was unheard of.

It didn\u2019t kill her, but it did defeat her completely. Also, while you are correct that Kakashi\u2019s aim with Kamui isn\u2019t perfect(which isn\u2019t exactly true, you\u2019re basing that off of his first time using it against the most mobile of the akatsuki members, when in reality he\u2019s been able to delicately Kamui tiny rasengan from long distance while moving, along with other similar things of that nature), Kakashi is aware of that weakness. Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance. I\u2019d say she wins 3/5 times, maybe 7/10 at best.",

Assuming Sasuke was going full speed kakashi would be at least the speed of raikage at that time because Sasuke can go as fast as raikage. At That time pre war. We can only assume kakashi got stronger, more stamina because no more chakra drain.

She\u2019s, in canon repeatedly, stated to be as powerful as orochimaru and Jiraiya. Kakashi, as strong as he is, only matches those two at his absolute peak, and even then I don\u2019t if he could beat either of them. \n\nKakashi without the sharingan does not match well against tsunade. I don\u2019t know that he has a jutsu that can defeat her 100 healings, and any of his intelligent trap strategies he repeatedly employs isn\u2019t effective against someone who can break down boulders and buildings with an average punch(by their standards). \n\nLike I said somewhere else, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wipe for either, but I\u2019m pretty sure Tsunade just matches up against kakashi too well for him to beat her more than 40% of the time.",

So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

Assuming Sasuke was going full speed kakashi would be at least the speed of raikage at that time because Sasuke can go as fast as raikage. At That time pre war. We can only assume kakashi got stronger, more stamina because no more chakra drain. Tsunade literally got split in half and got sewed together I have no doubt war arc kakashi> war arc Tsunade, Boruto kakashi > Boruto Tsunade",

Jiraiya was incredibly strong but had an unlucky matchup. And Kakashi would have won against tendo pain by himself like twice in the fight but the first time Pain used the \"Rinnegan plot device\" as I call it where he missed the Chidori and hit the wall and the second time the robo pain took the second hit. Kakashi gets beaten by fucking Uchiha and Senju Gods, by Uzumakis with Rinnegans and whatnot lmao. Its not like he lost against fodder lol. Another example is how Kakashi won against Obito even tho Obito thought of himself tied or little stronger than Itachi lol.",

As a result, you can also apply this feat to Tsunade which is a clear indicator of intelligence. The proof is in this video at 9:06 https://youtu.be/BxTgwsaDzQU",

Minato guessed it was a space-time ability that also teleports the user and not just erasing \"part of the user's body\" but making them a ghost as a whole until the user decides to attack (therefore deactivating the ability), Minato figured that out in the heat of the action and with a few interactions (two iirc).

Minato guessed it was a space-time ability that also teleports the user and not just erasing \"part of the user's body\" but making them a ghost as a whole until the user decides to attack (therefore deactivating the ability), Minato figured that out in the heat of the action and with a few interactions (two iirc).\n\nDid you even watch the video? That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi. As a result, the village would never have been blown up and with the assistance of two other powerful shinobi, casualties would have been at a minimum.",

If it comes to destructive power, Tsunade easily has the edge. If it's stamina and chakra reserves, she at least rivals him. If it's defence, her 100 healings could probably last as long as the lightning armour. Her punches were able to destroy Madara's ribcage Susano'o that even an enormous sage mode rasengan couldn't scratch. I imagine she should be able to rip through the lightning armor with that or even bypass it through her nervous system scrambling technique. The only category that poses a significant threat to her is speed, both from his physical movement and black lightning techniques. It's debatable whether or not she could react and at least partially block the techniques even though she's not in the same **movement** speed tier as the raikage. We don't have good scaling to determine how sharp her reflexes are.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo. If you're going to argue with that feat, 4th raikage stopped one of those susanoo with a single hand, so 4th raikage and Tsunade have similar strength. In terms of speed, her speed is laughable compared to any legendary ninja.",

She has the name and some reasoning for being tanky but she doesnt have ANY jutsus learned from those clans. She never learned sage jutsu, no fuin jutsu from the Uzumakis or the chakra chains that Uzumakis have (like Karin, Kushina and Nagato). She never developed any jutsu besides that chakra seal and she only had the idea because Hashirama always had it on without weaving handsigns. She has an incredibly weak failed Student and another student who only has the seal as the only viable jutsu. Meanwhile Orochimaru had Sasuke and Kabuto, 2 strong Shinobis, Kabuto started the war, was a Genius who also mastered the sage art and survived a hit by 4 tails naruto pretty easily while the same hit gave Jiraiya a big ass scar. Jiraiya trained Minato an absolute Genius in all aspects and Naruto whos well.. Naruto. He also trained Nagato, Konan and Yahiko. 3 Orphans who decided the future of a small country and boosted its reputation and power so much that Konoha had to sneakily attack them together with Hanzo (who fought the Sannins too lol) and yet they nearly all died Hanzo and Danzo running away. Comparing Tsunade to Orochimaru and Jiraiya she is an absolute weak shit stain lol.",

I will say she does some crazy shit in that fight but they\u2019re really only strength/durability feats. She may have medical analytical abilities but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to combat ability. She has never really shown herself to be strategic, at least in the manga/show. She\u2019s more of a sweeper/tank. Kakashi on the other hand got an asspull strength/stamina/chakra boost in the late war arc. He goes from being unable to fight the pains without completely depleting his chakra to being able to fight the seven ninja swordsmen, and then several tailed beasts (even tanking a blow from one of them), and then obito, and then help in the fight against jubito and then jubimadara and then played a big role in the fight against Kaguya. Hokage Kakashi may not have the sharingan (and arguably may not have the 1000 jutsu tho I personally don\u2019t agree with that), but he should still have the asspull strength/stamina boost (pre DMS perfect Susanoo) and since he no longer has the sharingan, there\u2019s no longer a constant drain on his chakra. I still think Kakashi takes the win. If you look at his fights, he nearly always is a precise fighter who goes out of his way to not make mistakes since he was historically hampered with low stamina/low chakra reserves. He\u2019s not gonna let Tsunade tag him with one of her Susanoo busting punches.\n\nEdit: holy shit my bad for the rant, didn\u2019t realize I wrote so much",

She's a keen analyst and her eye notices tons of shit just at a glance, even from a distance.

It's obviously true, but taking someone's key strength away makes most characters in the series garbage. Besides, even without the mark she's able to oneshot Orochimaru (in the manga) in a rusty and hemophobic state in addition to completely rewiring an opponent's nervous system thereby scrambling their movement. \n\n>she also hasn't amounted to much in the show, she was hyped up so hard and never won an important fight in the whole show.\n\nShe literally only had 2 fights, the first of which she was out of combat for 20 years, out of shape and hemophobic yet STILL managed to put Orochimaru out of commission with one hit. In the second she went up against fucking Madara. None of the hokage would do any better than her against him except Hashirama and Naruto. \n\n>Meanwhile Kakashi literally helped kill a god but yeah sure Tsunade is better an all.\n\nKakashi only managed to assist because Obito gifted him DMS. Kakashi gets exactly 0 praise/merit for that because it was literally a random, bs, gifted power up.\n\n>Book smart doesn't mean battle smart. Just bcs someone knows how to create medicine doesn't mean they know how to quickly develop a strategy to battle and counter the enemies attacks.\n\nYes, but having sharp analytical skills is extremely helpful in realizing at least partially your opponent's intentions. You can at least partially unravel their plans by carefully observing them.",

She also nearly got manhandled by Kabuto, which is an argument in itself.\n\n\n>\nKakashi only managed to assist because Obito gifted him DMS. Kakashi gets exactly 0 praise/merit for that because it was literally a random, bs, gifted power up.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's BS it's a feat he had and that has to be taken into consideration when talking strength. You can't just disregard something, becaus you don't like it.\n\n>\nYes, but having sharp analytical skills is extremely helpful in realizing at least partially your opponent's intentions.

Like I said before, we don't have scaling of sufficient quality to determine whether or not she would be able to react despite not being in the same movement speed tier as the raikage. \n\n>And also: she didnt create shit lol. Hashirama created that jutsu and had it active passively all the time stated by Madara and all that without weaving handsigns. \n\nHashirama did not create the 100 healings. The recovery is an innate power in his cells as demonstrated by people who have them grafted (Obito and Madara). In other words, his body did it for him. \n\nIn the end, this just makes Tsunade's feat even more impressive. She managed to perfectly emulate one of the abilities of the \"God of Shinobi\" by developing the 100 healings. That would be the same as Yamato using wood style on the same level as Hashirama for example. \n\n>And \"unrivaled\" during the second war isnt really relevant since there werent tons of strong fighters. \n\nAre you kidding me? The second war had Hanzo, Hiruzen, the 2nd Mizukage and Tsuchikage (maybe), Chiyo, the Uchiha Clan. \n\n>Look at the third world war. Kakashis Father, Chiyo (took over a country by herself lol), Sasukes Father, Minato, A and Bee and most seven swordsmen (who were alive at that point) were also absolute beasts.\n\nSee above. Also how are the seven swordsmen even worth mentioning at all here. Literally all fodder except Kisame.\n\n>Yes Tsunade may be stronger than some\n\nThere we go you said it yourself.",

Just a couple arcs before, he was completely depleted after a fight against the Paths of Pain that lasted maybe five minutes. And now he\u2019s fighting all these strong opponents/boss battles one after the other? Yes his Kamui became stronger and he got more control of it, but the Kamui itself isn\u2019t the reason for his increased abilities, it\u2019s literally just an ability. Dude is legendary; he was able to react to Juubi Madara, a person who was relative to KCM Naruto who casually dodged a laser that was stated to be light speed. Kakashi as a fighter is slept on. Gai never would have done as well as he did if Kakashi hadn\u2019t kamuid everything away from Gai, and that took extremely precise, extremely quick reaction time, precise control of the ability, chakra, and the stamina to do this after having fought against famous ninja, the tailed beasts, and obito/juubito. I\u2019m tired of arguing this so I\u2019m peacing out, thanks for the discussion",

But Kakashi, strength wise? He's weaker and that's a fact. Like Might Guy, he says he became stronger since the war, but he's weaker and that's also a fact(until he shows otherwise), dude's missing an entire leg even though his specialty is taijutsu which isn't even as big a loss as a Mangekyo Sharingan, so he's more than likely still in better shape than Kakashi.",

The Feudal Lord appoints the Hokage and is in charge of international affairs (like approving the Shinobi Alliance), but he seems pretty hands off after that. This matches the general notion of feudalism too, various semi-independant lords/nobles whose holdings are granted by a higher lord in exchange for fealty.",

Aside from dealing with the Uchiha issue (which Hiruzen basically didn't do anything for anyway), Hiruzen was mostly just managing shinobi contracts and overseeing the village military/security forces. \n\nNaruto created a time of peace, which meant an explosion of economic and social growth. Populations boomed, technology advanced, and businesses thrived. There was suddenly need for all the traditional services we expect in a modern city: zoning, coordinated waste disposal, building inspection, electrical utility management, large-scale plumbing systems, etc. And that's probably where most of Naruto's paperwork comes from. \n\nTsunade had plenty of paperwork too, but I think most of that was probably backlog from the gap between Hiruzen and Tsunade's terms. That and her desire for radical political changes like abolishing Root (attempting to anyway) and probably reforming the medical ninjutsu school.\n\nEdit: not to say that Naruto is individually reviewing every zoning request (though he might be), just that he's probably the final decisionmaker (probably veto or ratification) for any committee decisions. He's the one who puts the final decisions on the Chunin Exam rules, and I imagine he does the same for any other major decision affecting the village.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her. She wouldn't be able to get a hit in.\n\n\nFor her regeneration we already seen cutting her in half is enough to nearly kill her even with it going.\n\n\n\nTsunade was only impressive when she was first introduced because her ridiculous strength was unheard of. Now that that specific feat isn't all that great I think kakashi easily out classes her.\n\n\nI think kakashi vs hiruzen would be a closer and more fun match.",

It didn\u2019t kill her, but it did defeat her completely. Also, while you are correct that Kakashi\u2019s aim with Kamui isn\u2019t perfect(which isn\u2019t exactly true, you\u2019re basing that off of his first time using it against the most mobile of the akatsuki members, when in reality he\u2019s been able to delicately Kamui tiny rasengan from long distance while moving, along with other similar things of that nature), Kakashi is aware of that weakness. Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance. I\u2019d say she wins 3/5 times, maybe 7/10 at best.",

But, jokes aside, the fact that people in this sub think Tsunade(and Sakura) are just \u201cpunch kick regenerate\u201d is absolutely absurd lmao this is one of the legendary sannin, a hokage, and repeatedly proclaimed by just about everyone as the strongest kunoichi of all time. She\u2019s, in canon repeatedly, stated to be as powerful as orochimaru and Jiraiya. Kakashi, as strong as he is, only matches those two at his absolute peak, and even then I don\u2019t if he could beat either of them. \n\nKakashi without the sharingan does not match well against tsunade. I don\u2019t know that he has a jutsu that can defeat her 100 healings, and any of his intelligent trap strategies he repeatedly employs isn\u2019t effective against someone who can break down boulders and buildings with an average punch(by their standards). \n\nLike I said somewhere else, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wipe for either, but I\u2019m pretty sure Tsunade just matches up against kakashi too well for him to beat her more than 40% of the time.",

So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

Jiraiya was incredibly strong but had an unlucky matchup. And Kakashi would have won against tendo pain by himself like twice in the fight but the first time Pain used the \"Rinnegan plot device\" as I call it where he missed the Chidori and hit the wall and the second time the robo pain took the second hit. Kakashi gets beaten by fucking Uchiha and Senju Gods, by Uzumakis with Rinnegans and whatnot lmao. Its not like he lost against fodder lol.

Pain knew all of jirayas abilities but jiraya knew none of his. he could kill at least 2 of the pains with 0 knowledge and was stronger than naruto even in sage mode because he could merge and keep sage mode longer. \n\n> the intel he got was pretty instrumental in Naruto being able to take Pain down\n\nthey had to repeat the intel to him again when he is summoned to the village, this is false.",

As a result, you can also apply this feat to Tsunade which is a clear indicator of intelligence. The proof is in this video at 9:06 https://youtu.be/BxTgwsaDzQU",

That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi. As a result, the village would never have been blown up and with the assistance of two other powerful shinobi, casualties would have been at a minimum.",

If it comes to destructive power, Tsunade easily has the edge. If it's stamina and chakra reserves, she at least rivals him. If it's defence, her 100 healings could probably last as long as the lightning armour. Her punches were able to destroy Madara's ribcage Susano'o that even an enormous sage mode rasengan couldn't scratch. I imagine she should be able to rip through the lightning armor with that or even bypass it through her nervous system scrambling technique. The only category that poses a significant threat to her is speed, both from his physical movement and black lightning techniques. It's debatable whether or not she could react and at least partially block the techniques even though she's not in the same **movement** speed tier as the raikage. We don't have good scaling to determine how sharp her reflexes are.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo. If you're going to argue with that feat, 4th raikage stopped one of those susanoo with a single hand, so 4th raikage and Tsunade have similar strength.

She never developed any jutsu besides that chakra seal and she only had the idea because Hashirama always had it on without weaving handsigns. She has an incredibly weak failed Student and another student who only has the seal as the only viable jutsu. Meanwhile Orochimaru had Sasuke and Kabuto, 2 strong Shinobis, Kabuto started the war, was a Genius who also mastered the sage art and survived a hit by 4 tails naruto pretty easily while the same hit gave Jiraiya a big ass scar. Jiraiya trained Minato an absolute Genius in all aspects and Naruto whos well.. Naruto. He also trained Nagato, Konan and Yahiko. 3 Orphans who decided the future of a small country and boosted its reputation and power so much that Konoha had to sneakily attack them together with Hanzo (who fought the Sannins too lol) and yet they nearly all died Hanzo and Danzo running away. Comparing Tsunade to Orochimaru and Jiraiya she is an absolute weak shit stain lol.",

I will say she does some crazy shit in that fight but they\u2019re really only strength/durability feats. She may have medical analytical abilities but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to combat ability. She has never really shown herself to be strategic, at least in the manga/show. She\u2019s more of a sweeper/tank. Kakashi on the other hand got an asspull strength/stamina/chakra boost in the late war arc. He goes from being unable to fight the pains without completely depleting his chakra to being able to fight the seven ninja swordsmen, and then several tailed beasts (even tanking a blow from one of them), and then obito, and then help in the fight against jubito and then jubimadara and then played a big role in the fight against Kaguya. Hokage Kakashi may not have the sharingan (and arguably may not have the 1000 jutsu tho I personally don\u2019t agree with that), but he should still have the asspull strength/stamina boost (pre DMS perfect Susanoo) and since he no longer has the sharingan, there\u2019s no longer a constant drain on his chakra. I still think Kakashi takes the win. If you look at his fights, he nearly always is a precise fighter who goes out of his way to not make mistakes since he was historically hampered with low stamina/low chakra reserves. He\u2019s not gonna let Tsunade tag him with one of her Susanoo busting punches.\n\nEdit: holy shit my bad for the rant, didn\u2019t realize I wrote so much",

It's obviously true, but taking someone's key strength away makes most characters in the series garbage. Besides, even without the mark she's able to oneshot Orochimaru (in the manga) in a rusty and hemophobic state in addition to completely rewiring an opponent's nervous system thereby scrambling their movement. \n\n>she also hasn't amounted to much in the show, she was hyped up so hard and never won an important fight in the whole show.\n\nShe literally only had 2 fights, the first of which she was out of combat for 20 years, out of shape and hemophobic yet STILL managed to put Orochimaru out of commission with one hit. In the second she went up against fucking Madara. None of the hokage would do any better than her against him except Hashirama and Naruto. \n\n>Meanwhile Kakashi literally helped kill a god but yeah sure Tsunade is better an all.\n\nKakashi only managed to assist because Obito gifted him DMS. Kakashi gets exactly 0 praise/merit for that because it was literally a random, bs, gifted power up.\n\n>Book smart doesn't mean battle smart.

You can at least partially unravel their plans by carefully observing them.",

She also nearly got manhandled by Kabuto, which is an argument in itself.\n\n\n>\nKakashi only managed to assist because Obito gifted him DMS.

Also, if we're talking strategy, Kakashi is literally known for both that and having a Sharingan which can literally analyse quickly!",

Like I said before, we don't have scaling of sufficient quality to determine whether or not she would be able to react despite not being in the same movement speed tier as the raikage. \n\n>And also: she didnt create shit lol. Hashirama created that jutsu and had it active passively all the time stated by Madara and all that without weaving handsigns. \n\nHashirama did not create the 100 healings. The recovery is an innate power in his cells as demonstrated by people who have them grafted (Obito and Madara). In other words, his body did it for him. \n\nIn the end, this just makes Tsunade's feat even more impressive. She managed to perfectly emulate one of the abilities of the \"God of Shinobi\" by developing the 100 healings. That would be the same as Yamato using wood style on the same level as Hashirama for example. \n\n>And \"unrivaled\" during the second war isnt really relevant since there werent tons of strong fighters. \n\nAre you kidding me? The second war had Hanzo, Hiruzen, the 2nd Mizukage and Tsuchikage (maybe), Chiyo, the Uchiha Clan. \n\n>Look at the third world war. Kakashis Father, Chiyo (took over a country by herself lol), Sasukes Father, Minato, A and Bee and most seven swordsmen (who were alive at that point) were also absolute beasts.\n\nSee above. Also how are the seven swordsmen even worth mentioning at all here. Literally all fodder except Kisame.\n\n>Yes Tsunade may be stronger than some\n\nThere we go you said it yourself.",

Yes his Kamui became stronger and he got more control of it, but the Kamui itself isn\u2019t the reason for his increased abilities, it\u2019s literally just an ability. Dude is legendary; he was able to react to Juubi Madara, a person who was relative to KCM Naruto who casually dodged a laser that was stated to be light speed. Kakashi as a fighter is slept on. Gai never would have done as well as he did if Kakashi hadn\u2019t kamuid everything away from Gai, and that took extremely precise, extremely quick reaction time, precise control of the ability, chakra, and the stamina to do this after having fought against famous ninja, the tailed beasts, and obito/juubito.

The Feudal Lord appoints the Hokage and is in charge of international affairs (like approving the Shinobi Alliance), but he seems pretty hands off after that. This matches the general notion of feudalism too, various semi-independant lords/nobles whose holdings are granted by a higher lord in exchange for fealty.",

Aside from dealing with the Uchiha issue (which Hiruzen basically didn't do anything for anyway), Hiruzen was mostly just managing shinobi contracts and overseeing the village military/security forces. \n\nNaruto created a time of peace, which meant an explosion of economic and social growth. Populations boomed, technology advanced, and businesses thrived. There was suddenly need for all the traditional services we expect in a modern city: zoning, coordinated waste disposal, building inspection, electrical utility management, large-scale plumbing systems, etc. And that's probably where most of Naruto's paperwork comes from. \n\nTsunade had plenty of paperwork too, but I think most of that was probably backlog from the gap between Hiruzen and Tsunade's terms. That and her desire for radical political changes like abolishing Root (attempting to anyway) and probably reforming the medical ninjutsu school.\n\nEdit: not to say that Naruto is individually reviewing every zoning request (though he might be), just that he's probably the final decisionmaker (probably veto or ratification) for any committee decisions. He's the one who puts the final decisions on the Chunin Exam rules, and I imagine he does the same for any other major decision affecting the village.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her. She wouldn't be able to get a hit in.\n\n\nFor her regeneration we already seen cutting her in half is enough to nearly kill her even with it going.\n\n\n\nTsunade was only impressive when she was first introduced because her ridiculous strength was unheard of.

It didn\u2019t kill her, but it did defeat her completely. Also, while you are correct that Kakashi\u2019s aim with Kamui isn\u2019t perfect(which isn\u2019t exactly true, you\u2019re basing that off of his first time using it against the most mobile of the akatsuki members, when in reality he\u2019s been able to delicately Kamui tiny rasengan from long distance while moving, along with other similar things of that nature), Kakashi is aware of that weakness. Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance. I\u2019d say she wins 3/5 times, maybe 7/10 at best.",

He basically puts his chakra into kakashi despite already being dead(and thus breaks continuity on everything we\u2019ve ever seen in regards to sharingan in Naruto) and turns kakashis normal eyes into fully powered and the understanding and ability to use them to their full power.",

But, jokes aside, the fact that people in this sub think Tsunade(and Sakura) are just \u201cpunch kick regenerate\u201d is absolutely absurd lmao this is one of the legendary sannin, a hokage, and repeatedly proclaimed by just about everyone as the strongest kunoichi of all time. She\u2019s, in canon repeatedly, stated to be as powerful as orochimaru and Jiraiya. Kakashi, as strong as he is, only matches those two at his absolute peak, and even then I don\u2019t if he could beat either of them. \n\nKakashi without the sharingan does not match well against tsunade. I don\u2019t know that he has a jutsu that can defeat her 100 healings, and any of his intelligent trap strategies he repeatedly employs isn\u2019t effective against someone who can break down boulders and buildings with an average punch(by their standards). \n\nLike I said somewhere else, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wipe for either, but I\u2019m pretty sure Tsunade just matches up against kakashi too well for him to beat her more than 40% of the time.",

So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

Jiraiya was incredibly strong but had an unlucky matchup. And Kakashi would have won against tendo pain by himself like twice in the fight but the first time Pain used the \"Rinnegan plot device\" as I call it where he missed the Chidori and hit the wall and the second time the robo pain took the second hit. Kakashi gets beaten by fucking Uchiha and Senju Gods, by Uzumakis with Rinnegans and whatnot lmao. Its not like he lost against fodder lol. Another example is how Kakashi won against Obito even tho Obito thought of himself tied or little stronger than Itachi lol.",

As a result, you can also apply this feat to Tsunade which is a clear indicator of intelligence. The proof is in this video at 9:06 https://youtu.be/BxTgwsaDzQU",

Minato guessed it was a space-time ability that also teleports the user and not just erasing \"part of the user's body\" but making them a ghost as a whole until the user decides to attack (therefore deactivating the ability), Minato figured that out in the heat of the action and with a few interactions (two iirc).\n\nDid you even watch the video? That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi. As a result, the village would never have been blown up and with the assistance of two other powerful shinobi, casualties would have been at a minimum.",

If it comes to destructive power, Tsunade easily has the edge. If it's stamina and chakra reserves, she at least rivals him. If it's defence, her 100 healings could probably last as long as the lightning armour. Her punches were able to destroy Madara's ribcage Susano'o that even an enormous sage mode rasengan couldn't scratch. I imagine she should be able to rip through the lightning armor with that or even bypass it through her nervous system scrambling technique. The only category that poses a significant threat to her is speed, both from his physical movement and black lightning techniques. It's debatable whether or not she could react and at least partially block the techniques even though she's not in the same **movement** speed tier as the raikage. We don't have good scaling to determine how sharp her reflexes are.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo. If you're going to argue with that feat, 4th raikage stopped one of those susanoo with a single hand, so 4th raikage and Tsunade have similar strength.

She never developed any jutsu besides that chakra seal and she only had the idea because Hashirama always had it on without weaving handsigns. She has an incredibly weak failed Student and another student who only has the seal as the only viable jutsu. Meanwhile Orochimaru had Sasuke and Kabuto, 2 strong Shinobis, Kabuto started the war, was a Genius who also mastered the sage art and survived a hit by 4 tails naruto pretty easily while the same hit gave Jiraiya a big ass scar. Jiraiya trained Minato an absolute Genius in all aspects and Naruto whos well.. Naruto. He also trained Nagato, Konan and Yahiko. 3 Orphans who decided the future of a small country and boosted its reputation and power so much that Konoha had to sneakily attack them together with Hanzo (who fought the Sannins too lol) and yet they nearly all died Hanzo and Danzo running away.

I will say she does some crazy shit in that fight but they\u2019re really only strength/durability feats. She may have medical analytical abilities but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to combat ability. She has never really shown herself to be strategic, at least in the manga/show. She\u2019s more of a sweeper/tank. Kakashi on the other hand got an asspull strength/stamina/chakra boost in the late war arc. He goes from being unable to fight the pains without completely depleting his chakra to being able to fight the seven ninja swordsmen, and then several tailed beasts (even tanking a blow from one of them), and then obito, and then help in the fight against jubito and then jubimadara and then played a big role in the fight against Kaguya. Hokage Kakashi may not have the sharingan (and arguably may not have the 1000 jutsu tho I personally don\u2019t agree with that), but he should still have the asspull strength/stamina boost (pre DMS perfect Susanoo) and since he no longer has the sharingan, there\u2019s no longer a constant drain on his chakra. I still think Kakashi takes the win. If you look at his fights, he nearly always is a precise fighter who goes out of his way to not make mistakes since he was historically hampered with low stamina/low chakra reserves. He\u2019s not gonna let Tsunade tag him with one of her Susanoo busting punches.\n\nEdit: holy shit my bad for the rant, didn\u2019t realize I wrote so much",

Like I said before, we don't have scaling of sufficient quality to determine whether or not she would be able to react despite not being in the same movement speed tier as the raikage. \n\n>And also: she didnt create shit lol. Hashirama created that jutsu and had it active passively all the time stated by Madara and all that without weaving handsigns. \n\nHashirama did not create the 100 healings. The recovery is an innate power in his cells as demonstrated by people who have them grafted (Obito and Madara). In other words, his body did it for him. \n\nIn the end, this just makes Tsunade's feat even more impressive. She managed to perfectly emulate one of the abilities of the \"God of Shinobi\" by developing the 100 healings. That would be the same as Yamato using wood style on the same level as Hashirama for example. \n\n>And \"unrivaled\" during the second war isnt really relevant since there werent tons of strong fighters. \n\nAre you kidding me? The second war had Hanzo, Hiruzen, the 2nd Mizukage and Tsuchikage (maybe), Chiyo, the Uchiha Clan. \n\n>Look at the third world war. Kakashis Father, Chiyo (took over a country by herself lol), Sasukes Father, Minato, A and Bee and most seven swordsmen (who were alive at that point) were also absolute beasts.\n\nSee above. Also how are the seven swordsmen even worth mentioning at all here. Literally all fodder except Kisame.\n\n>Yes Tsunade may be stronger than some\n\nThere we go you said it yourself.",

Just a couple arcs before, he was completely depleted after a fight against the Paths of Pain that lasted maybe five minutes. And now he\u2019s fighting all these strong opponents/boss battles one after the other? Yes his Kamui became stronger and he got more control of it, but the Kamui itself isn\u2019t the reason for his increased abilities, it\u2019s literally just an ability. Dude is legendary; he was able to react to Juubi Madara, a person who was relative to KCM Naruto who casually dodged a laser that was stated to be light speed. Kakashi as a fighter is slept on. Gai never would have done as well as he did if Kakashi hadn\u2019t kamuid everything away from Gai, and that took extremely precise, extremely quick reaction time, precise control of the ability, chakra, and the stamina to do this after having fought against famous ninja, the tailed beasts, and obito/juubito.

That one is connected to the movie, road to ninja. The one I'm talking about is more of a combined what if. Its what if Minato never died and what if the Uchiha massacre didn't happen. Which I don't think it would've with Minato as hokage because he was smart unlike \"the professor\"\n\nBut ye boruto is a stereotypical entitled rich kid and sucks balls with a shitty motivation for the first like.  .  . Most the anime. He wasn't always like that though and was actually you know . . . A decent person. That was before Naruto became hokage though. He was still a brat but to a lesser extent and actually MADE FUCKING SENSE! \n\nBut ye I see your point.",

Aside from dealing with the Uchiha issue (which Hiruzen basically didn't do anything for anyway), Hiruzen was mostly just managing shinobi contracts and overseeing the village military/security forces. \n\nNaruto created a time of peace, which meant an explosion of economic and social growth. Populations boomed, technology advanced, and businesses thrived. There was suddenly need for all the traditional services we expect in a modern city: zoning, coordinated waste disposal, building inspection, electrical utility management, large-scale plumbing systems, etc. And that's probably where most of Naruto's paperwork comes from. \n\nTsunade had plenty of paperwork too, but I think most of that was probably backlog from the gap between Hiruzen and Tsunade's terms. That and her desire for radical political changes like abolishing Root (attempting to anyway) and probably reforming the medical ninjutsu school.\n\nEdit: not to say that Naruto is individually reviewing every zoning request (though he might be), just that he's probably the final decisionmaker (probably veto or ratification) for any committee decisions. He's the one who puts the final decisions on the Chunin Exam rules, and I imagine he does the same for any other major decision affecting the village.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her. She wouldn't be able to get a hit in.\n\n\nFor her regeneration we already seen cutting her in half is enough to nearly kill her even with it going.\n\n\n\nTsunade was only impressive when she was first introduced because her ridiculous strength was unheard of. Now that that specific feat isn't all that great I think kakashi easily out classes her.\n\n\nI think kakashi vs hiruzen would be a closer and more fun match.",

Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance.

                            "body": "I don\u2019t really understand his argument to be honest. So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

As a result, you can also apply this feat to Tsunade which is a clear indicator of intelligence. The proof is in this video at 9:06 https://youtu.be/BxTgwsaDzQU",

That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi. As a result, the village would never have been blown up and with the assistance of two other powerful shinobi, casualties would have been at a minimum.",

If it's stamina and chakra reserves, she at least rivals him. If it's defence, her 100 healings could probably last as long as the lightning armour. Her punches were able to destroy Madara's ribcage Susano'o that even an enormous sage mode rasengan couldn't scratch. I imagine she should be able to rip through the lightning armor with that or even bypass it through her nervous system scrambling technique. The only category that poses a significant threat to her is speed, both from his physical movement and black lightning techniques. It's debatable whether or not she could react and at least partially block the techniques even though she's not in the same **movement** speed tier as the raikage. We don't have good scaling to determine how sharp her reflexes are.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

It's always hilarious when people bring up the byakugo seal which is just an asset used for critical moments only, lifelong gathered chakra for one or few fights, it's like arguing Gai is stronger than everyone because of his 8 gates form but nobody is throwing that because it's just one time use ability. Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo. If you're going to argue with that feat, 4th raikage stopped one of those susanoo with a single hand, so 4th raikage and Tsunade have similar strength. In terms of speed, her speed is laughable compared to any legendary ninja.",

Yes his Kamui became stronger and he got more control of it, but the Kamui itself isn\u2019t the reason for his increased abilities, it\u2019s literally just an ability. Dude is legendary; he was able to react to Juubi Madara, a person who was relative to KCM Naruto who casually dodged a laser that was stated to be light speed. Kakashi as a fighter is slept on. Gai never would have done as well as he did if Kakashi hadn\u2019t kamuid everything away from Gai, and that took extremely precise, extremely quick reaction time, precise control of the ability, chakra, and the stamina to do this after having fought against famous ninja, the tailed beasts, and obito/juubito.

What he lost was it\u2019s enhanced perception and kamui, which are things he can easily overcome by further developing and refining his techniques (like Chidori) so that they don\u2019t have to rely on those things. His speed was his own prior to receiving the eye, as was his skill with taijutsu. The sharingan doesn\u2019t inherently buff those things, the Uchiha just have naturally heightened physicality. And without the Sharingan as a crutch he can improve himself to get around that loss. Yeah, his raw observational ability is worse without it, but his intellectual ability to analyze what he sees isn\u2019t, and he\u2019s much smarter than Hiruzen.",

Aside from dealing with the Uchiha issue (which Hiruzen basically didn't do anything for anyway), Hiruzen was mostly just managing shinobi contracts and overseeing the village military/security forces. \n\nNaruto created a time of peace, which meant an explosion of economic and social growth. Populations boomed, technology advanced, and businesses thrived. There was suddenly need for all the traditional services we expect in a modern city: zoning, coordinated waste disposal, building inspection, electrical utility management, large-scale plumbing systems, etc. And that's probably where most of Naruto's paperwork comes from. \n\nTsunade had plenty of paperwork too, but I think most of that was probably backlog from the gap between Hiruzen and Tsunade's terms. That and her desire for radical political changes like abolishing Root (attempting to anyway) and probably reforming the medical ninjutsu school.\n\nEdit: not to say that Naruto is individually reviewing every zoning request (though he might be), just that he's probably the final decisionmaker (probably veto or ratification) for any committee decisions. He's the one who puts the final decisions on the Chunin Exam rules, and I imagine he does the same for any other major decision affecting the village.",

I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her.

Also, while you are correct that Kakashi\u2019s aim with Kamui isn\u2019t perfect(which isn\u2019t exactly true, you\u2019re basing that off of his first time using it against the most mobile of the akatsuki members, when in reality he\u2019s been able to delicately Kamui tiny rasengan from long distance while moving, along with other similar things of that nature), Kakashi is aware of that weakness. Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance.

So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi. As a result, the village would never have been blown up and with the assistance of two other powerful shinobi, casualties would have been at a minimum.",

If it's stamina and chakra reserves, she at least rivals him. If it's defence, her 100 healings could probably last as long as the lightning armour. Her punches were able to destroy Madara's ribcage Susano'o that even an enormous sage mode rasengan couldn't scratch. I imagine she should be able to rip through the lightning armor with that or even bypass it through her nervous system scrambling technique. The only category that poses a significant threat to her is speed, both from his physical movement and black lightning techniques. It's debatable whether or not she could react and at least partially block the techniques even though she's not in the same **movement** speed tier as the raikage. We don't have good scaling to determine how sharp her reflexes are.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo. If you're going to argue with that feat, 4th raikage stopped one of those susanoo with a single hand, so 4th raikage and Tsunade have similar strength.

She has the name and some reasoning for being tanky but she doesnt have ANY jutsus learned from those clans. She never learned sage jutsu, no fuin jutsu from the Uzumakis or the chakra chains that Uzumakis have (like Karin, Kushina and Nagato). She never developed any jutsu besides that chakra seal and she only had the idea because Hashirama always had it on without weaving handsigns. She has an incredibly weak failed Student and another student who only has the seal as the only viable jutsu. Meanwhile Orochimaru had Sasuke and Kabuto, 2 strong Shinobis, Kabuto started the war, was a Genius who also mastered the sage art and survived a hit by 4 tails naruto pretty easily while the same hit gave Jiraiya a big ass scar. Jiraiya trained Minato an absolute Genius in all aspects and Naruto whos well.. Naruto. He also trained Nagato, Konan and Yahiko. 3 Orphans who decided the future of a small country and boosted its reputation and power so much that Konoha had to sneakily attack them together with Hanzo (who fought the Sannins too lol) and yet they nearly all died Hanzo and Danzo running away. Comparing Tsunade to Orochimaru and Jiraiya she is an absolute weak shit stain lol.",

Yes his Kamui became stronger and he got more control of it, but the Kamui itself isn\u2019t the reason for his increased abilities, it\u2019s literally just an ability. Dude is legendary; he was able to react to Juubi Madara, a person who was relative to KCM Naruto who casually dodged a laser that was stated to be light speed. Kakashi as a fighter is slept on. Gai never would have done as well as he did if Kakashi hadn\u2019t kamuid everything away from Gai, and that took extremely precise, extremely quick reaction time, precise control of the ability, chakra, and the stamina to do this after having fought against famous ninja, the tailed beasts, and obito/juubito.

His speed was his own prior to receiving the eye, as was his skill with taijutsu. The sharingan doesn\u2019t inherently buff those things, the Uchiha just have naturally heightened physicality. And without the Sharingan as a crutch he can improve himself to get around that loss.

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her.

Also, while you are correct that Kakashi\u2019s aim with Kamui isn\u2019t perfect(which isn\u2019t exactly true, you\u2019re basing that off of his first time using it against the most mobile of the akatsuki members, when in reality he\u2019s been able to delicately Kamui tiny rasengan from long distance while moving, along with other similar things of that nature), Kakashi is aware of that weakness. Look at the zabuza fight, literally the first fight in the show. He knows chidoris linear limitation, and compensates by trapping Zabuza with his summons to lock him down. While the summons wouldn\u2019t do much against Tsunades strength, a similar strategy would fix that problem. \n\nI think tsunade *probably* beats prime Kakashi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 100% chance.

Kakashi wouldn\u2019t be able to pull of something as big as that, so she\u2019d def summon katsuyu right away and heal the fuck out of herself\n\n\ndms kakashi stomps tho",

So Kakashi without good stamina has barely one move to be able to kill Tsunade with, and even using it he doesn\u2019t really have a way to tie her down and hit her with it due to her absurd strength, but having \u201cunlimited stamina\u201d(which, while supported by Kishi\u2019s awful continuity writing in the war arc, is just an absurd thing to assume he has lol) he can? The idea that he can just avoid tsunade for hours until he finally gets lucky and tricks her or something and can kamui her in the head isn\u2019t really a surefire and quantifiable argument. \n\nSwag makes great videos, always has, but sometimes he gets a bit too caught up in one side of a vs battle and tends to think of the other one as an inanimate fighter with no brain of their own. Tsunade isn\u2019t the smartest character in the show, but she\u2019s still absurdly intelligent in her own right. The idea that she would just let kakashi continually attempt to trap her and blip her head away doesn\u2019t hold up at all lol. \n\nHe literally explains for the prewar argument why Kakashi doesn\u2019t really stand a chance, and the only thing that changes between that and war arc kakashi is his stamina. His speed, strength, jutsu, and capabilities are the same, and there\u2019s no reason why stamina would change his inability to trap Tsunade long enough to send her head to kamuiland, not when she has equally infinite stamina and can tank any other damage that he throws at her, and willingly does tank damage to avoid getting tied down. \n\nDMS does have a chance, mostly because we don\u2019t actually know what the full capabilities would be theoretically. DMS Kakashi fighting a goddess is a very different fighter to the one who would face another normal human.",

Minato guessed it was a space-time ability that also teleports the user and not just erasing \"part of the user's body\" but making them a ghost as a whole until the user decides to attack (therefore deactivating the ability), Minato figured that out in the heat of the action and with a few interactions (two iirc).\n\nDid you even watch the video? That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade. If Danzo hadn't intervened, Naruto would have had the entire leaf to back him up in addition to Tsunade and Kakashi. As a result, the village would never have been blown up and with the assistance of two other powerful shinobi, casualties would have been at a minimum.",

The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Now when it comes to Tsunade, she barely cracked Madara's tier 1 susanoo that didn't even form entirely, and she barely damaged one of Madara's dozens of shdow clones' susanoo.

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

He's already experienced the ground shattering when he tested Sakura at the beginning of Shippuden so she won't even get the drop on him. I'd bet he's way faster than her. She wouldn't be able to get a hit in.\n\n\nFor her regeneration we already seen cutting her in half is enough to nearly kill her even with it going.\n\n\n\nTsunade was only impressive when she was first introduced because her ridiculous strength was unheard of. Now that that specific feat isn't all that great I think kakashi easily out classes her.\n\n\nI think kakashi vs hiruzen would be a closer and more fun match.",

Minato guessed it was a space-time ability that also teleports the user and not just erasing \"part of the user's body\" but making them a ghost as a whole until the user decides to attack (therefore deactivating the ability), Minato figured that out in the heat of the action and with a few interactions (two iirc).\n\nDid you even watch the video? That's **exactly** what Sakura figured out in similarly dire circumstances (chasing after Sasuke). She correctly theorized Kamui teleported away parts of your body **before** Kakashi, another genius, even realized. Just watch the video, the proof is right there. You should also read the wiki's page, it debunks this Kamui ghost thing you mentioned which is wrong. \n\n>I'm not even going to talk how he managed to defend the village the perfect way with all the timed decisions.\n\nSo did Tsunade.

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

The one I'm talking about is more of a combined what if. Its what if Minato never died and what if the Uchiha massacre didn't happen. Which I don't think it would've with Minato as hokage because he was smart unlike \"the professor\"\n\nBut ye boruto is a stereotypical entitled rich kid and sucks balls with a shitty motivation for the first like.  .  . Most the anime. He wasn't always like that though and was actually you know . . . A decent person. That was before Naruto became hokage though. He was still a brat but to a lesser extent and actually MADE FUCKING SENSE! \n\nBut ye I see your point.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",

I just told you that there is no indication that the 3rd raikage is physically stronger than the 4th. The nature of his damage being piercing rather than crushing has nothing to do with regards to physical strength. Therefore, there is no credible reason to reliably claim she does not best him in physical strength.\n\nTo address your second point, I imagine Madara's Susano'o is a lot more durable than the Eight tails flesh. Don't forget that a fresh MS Sasuke was able to cut one clean with his chidori spear which is relative to the rasengan in power. As we've seen before, even a giant sage mode rasengan couldn't even chip Madara's ribcage Susano'o whereas Tsunade shattered it completely and sent him flying in as little as 2 hits. The only logical conclusion to this is that Tsunade's punches scale far higher than Chidori and its spear variant which themselves were able to effortlessly pierce and slice through the eight tails.",

Still, Kakashi was a jonin at twelve years old, even before he received Obito's sharingan (granted, he got the sharingan on his first mission after being promoted). I think he still has a shot against Tsunade, but not against any of the other Kage. \n\nNo sharingan means chidori is now impractical (so says Minato anyway), but Kakashi should still have access to: rasengan, water dragon, shadow clones, earth walls, dog pack summoning, skilled taijutsu (nerfed since he can't as easily track opponents), purple lightning, lightning blade (the version that relies on a shadow clone to clothesline targets), and any other techniques he's memorized. \n\nIn one scene, which may be filler (I'm just not sure), we even see Kakashi open the first of the 8 gates while training; and Might Guy would probably be more than happy to teach Kakashi how to use the full set. \n\nKakashi should also have access to way more stamina now that his Sharingan is gone. Even just having it out drained his chakra, and even minor use of kamui was putting him in the hospital or killing him pre-war. \n\nAnd we shouldn't forget that Kakashi's own father, the White Fang, was basically Kakashi without a sharingan. Dude was so feared that he was given a unique epithet; something only super strong people like Sasori, Minato, Kisame, and Kakashi pulled off (and Zabuza too, but Zabuza's power suffers from early antagonist syndrome). Point is, Kakashi comes from good genes and was on track to surpass his dad with or without that hax eyeball. \n\nIn sum: Kakashi got nerfed when he lost his eye, but he's still one of the strongest non-uchiha and non-senju Shinobi in Konoha history.",
