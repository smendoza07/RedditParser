When you reach parts that you can't play to speed, slow them down and use them as exercises. \n\nTry avoiding tension. If you feel your muscles tense up or if you get frustrated just take a break.\nAlso try avoiding unnecessary movement on both your picking and fretting hand. It's all muscle memory, try slowing down and pay attention to your hand movements, what do you do wrong, is it that your fingers are too far off the fretboard, or maybe you are moving your picking hand to much to play a note. Try finding these out and stay disciplined. Good luck.\n",

When you reach parts that you can't play to speed, slow them down and use them as exercises. \n\nTry avoiding tension. If you feel your muscles tense up or if you get frustrated just take a break.\nAlso try avoiding unnecessary movement on both your picking and fretting hand. It's all muscle memory, try slowing down and pay attention to your hand movements, what do you do wrong, is it that your fingers are too far off the fretboard, or maybe you are moving your picking hand to much to play a note. Try finding these out and stay disciplined. Good luck.\n",

When you reach parts that you can't play to speed, slow them down and use them as exercises. \n\nTry avoiding tension. If you feel your muscles tense up or if you get frustrated just take a break.\nAlso try avoiding unnecessary movement on both your picking and fretting hand. It's all muscle memory, try slowing down and pay attention to your hand movements, what do you do wrong, is it that your fingers are too far off the fretboard, or maybe you are moving your picking hand to much to play a note. Try finding these out and stay disciplined. Good luck.\n",

When you reach parts that you can't play to speed, slow them down and use them as exercises. \n\nTry avoiding tension. If you feel your muscles tense up or if you get frustrated just take a break.\nAlso try avoiding unnecessary movement on both your picking and fretting hand. It's all muscle memory, try slowing down and pay attention to your hand movements, what do you do wrong, is it that your fingers are too far off the fretboard, or maybe you are moving your picking hand to much to play a note. Try finding these out and stay disciplined. Good luck.\n",
