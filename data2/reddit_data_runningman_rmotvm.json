Thehe only RM members to usually get nominated the award are YJS and KJK. Back then even with RM's popularity, YJS was still the only one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRM did get a best variety show awards from SBS because of how good the show itself is. Last time, the mothers of MUD got the daesang award so it's similar now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrazy thing is, KJK technically won 2x in a row.",

If the guys was deserving of the Daesang shouldn't they win best variety show also?\n\nThat's like giving BTS the grand award but they won't win the best male group award.

It existed a few times in past years too and past winners include Yang Sehyun and Seo Janghoon.\n\nAs much as JSJ has done a great job this year, I didn't feel it was daesang caliber. It only felt possible because there was no individual standout performance from anybody else. Compare it to what Yoo Jaesuk did last year for MBC to win the most obvious daesang in recent memory -- he's not on that level. Just being nominated (winning the Entertainer of the Year award) was a pretty good recognition. And let's face it, MUD's viewership rating has been incredible and I thought it was highly unlikely the daesang would go to any other show.\n\nThat being said, I'm not defending SBS's decision this year. Maybe not a daesang, but JSJ's performance still deserved a \"second-half\" award. I kinda appreciate what Lee Kyungkyu did there, saying that he wouldn't accept the award even if he got it. It sounds belittling but afterwards it felt like he's airing JSJ's grievances when JSJ couldn't do it himself.\n\nAlso how daesang itself was handled was weird. I understand that the award should probably go to MUD, but the team award diminishes the weight of the daesang. I would've supported KJK winning it again, either Tak Jaehoon or Lee Sangmin winning it, or Shin Dongyup winning it as a nod to MUD and the other shows he's doing for SBS.",

So, to me, he still win the highest individual award as the Daesang was given to a team. The most important thing is, his effort is recognized by the public and that means a lot more for him. Remember when he said he needs only 5 people to acknowledge him as an entertainer in Ep 550",
