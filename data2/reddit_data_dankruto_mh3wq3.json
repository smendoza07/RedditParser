They have these cool af skills and never have chances to use them in actual fights. \n\nSakura has her cool fight with Sasori and that's it until the war arc, despite being a **main character**. I can kind of understand the other kunouchi being ignored since they're side charcters, but Sakura? She's one of the main three characters. She's so underused.",

In fact Sakura was on a bunch of the missions in shippuden giving her more. For instance, choji, shino, and Lina got little screen time in shippuden. Heck Sakura faught an akatsuki member, who cares if it was at the beginning. Hinata marries naruto, and fights to protect him against pain, which causes the nine tails vs pain fight, so she\u2019s pretty important and gets some better scenes than a lot of the other male side characters. You\u2019re basically just mad because the girls didn\u2019t get enough showcase of their power, and think that because there\u2019s more male characters overall. I mean tsunade was the hokage ffs. Like for most of the entire series. Only good argument point would be ino or tenten, but their abilities are boring anyways don\u2019t really deserve screen time.",

Winry is literally sakura, but doesn\u2019t do anything of importance in the entire show besides giving Ed an arm and a leg, being send away somewhere for the most of the show and just brought back to fix up Ed\u2018s arm so they can build up a romance. Riza doesn\u2019t really have her own motivation and just follows Mustang around. Lust just fucks a guy and then gets roasted. Olivier doesn\u2019t really have a motivation either as far as I remember, is only introduced to give mustang an army at the end and then beats up her brother which made absolutely no sense, but \u201estrong wahman hell yeah!\u201c Izumi who didn\u2019t defeat anyone on her own. Isn\u2019t this what you guys always complain about? Mei is the only one which is actually good",

I understand that she wanted to eat their chakra or something, but with either reasoning, there's still the fact that she prolonged a fight against three of the only people that could actually stop her. I mean, I get arrogance, but this is supposed to be a replacement for Madara, who kept stunting on everybody except for Guy, Naruto and Sasuke after being sort-of revived by the SOSP, and Zetsu and Kaguya herself. With the little time she had to exist in the story, comparisons between the two are kind of inevitable. She didn't do it when she actually wanted to kill them either. At least Madara knew when to take someone seriously.\n\n>And kakashi and sasuke can both travel through dimensions and naruto punches holes through them.\n\nCan they? I sorta believe the Sharingan can do that because of course it can, but I definitely don't remember Naruto punching holes in dimensions. And even then, I don't think she knew that they could do that. And even then, she could just keep putting them back considering that I assume she has more chakra than all of them. Also, lava, gravity, and acid.\n\n>Both naruto and sasuke were way to strong to be killed by natural forces like gravity or lava.\n\nYeah, no. Lava is lava, and a dimension made of lava would kill them eventually through the actual lava or dehydration. A dimension made of gravity would eventually fold their spines under the strain. A dimension made of acid would melt them. Unlike Madara and probably Kaguya, Team 7 and Obito aren't immortal, and unlike specifically the former, they don't have infinite chakra to protect them. They'd run out eventually. Although if they can travel through dimensions, then who knows what that might do.\n\n>And you do realize that this is a show that is supposed to have entertaining fights, right? Naruto could have merked boruto in his fight in half a second but he didn\u2019t because plot.\n\nI get that. And that's fair enough. But I have to ask, why would you switch out your final boss for a completely new, previously relatively unseen character with new abilities, and then give the new final boss a abilities so overpowered that they have to actively avoid doing something obvious with it so they don't instantly win? Personally, that takes away a little bit of the entertainment value from me. Although I still think the fight was cool, it didn't make me think Kaguya was cool because I kept thinking \"Why isn't she just teleporting them into the lava or something? I mean, it seems like the obvious solution to me.\"\n\n>And madara wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTrue. But he still pretty much curb-stomped the second half of the war with relatively little help. He soloed an army, the Five Kage, and the main protagonists. Obito definitely helped, but Naruto and Sasuke needed a power boost from Ninja-God to fight Madara. And Kaguya had a sleeve demon that pretty much told her what the smart thing to do was every now and again.\n\n>Juubi madara had less screen time then kaguya in pretty sure.\n\nI don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Madara had more screentime. Or at the very least, I found Kaguya to be less memorable. Not in the sense that I couldn't remember her, but in that she felt less remarkable.\n\n>Not only that but it\u2019s much easier to seal someone rather then kill them if their invincible. Madara was basically immortal since he had prettt much instant regen and was super strong. So6p naruto and rinne sasuke were destroying madara before he turned into kaguya as well.\n\nYeah, you could seal them both, and they're both immortal (at least, I think Kaguya is). But I think Madara still felt like he was more of a threat, got more done, and was all around more... interesting than Kaguya.\n\nAll in all, I think that Kaguya, while powerful, didn't really make me invest in her as much as I would have liked. This is especially apparent to me because she was essentially the final boss of the anime (not counting the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that was more of a bookends), so I feel like she's supposed to feel like more of a main event. But she kinda just upstaged Madara, stole the spotlight, and did less with it than most other villains did. At least Nagato set his own stage. Although this is just my perspective.",

Nothing can change what kishi wrote sadly. I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

Although, admittedly, Naruto had the same problem there.\n\n- Having moments where she fails to do things like kill a wanted terrorist because of the aforementioned crush after trying to force everyone else to stop pursuing him because she was going to do it herself, and failing to slash a mass-murderer\u2019s eye out so it isn\u2019t used to end the world, making me wonder how she even managed to become a Chunin.\n\n- Having a lot of her character revolve around her one-sided crush on Sasuke, and how Naruto and Sasuke outclass her in every way without really changing it at all.\n\nAll in all, while there were a few improvements, such as her training with Tsunade, it kinda got thrown away in the end. She\u2019s weaker than Naruto and Sasuke, and she always stays like that. Naruto even got better healing powers than her. She has a crush on Sasuke for no real reason other than... well, no reason. She maintains that crush after her would-be lover repeatedly calls her out on having a crush on *him* of all people, and tries to kill her, even casually knocking her out by making a Genjutsu of him killing her after she poured her heart out to him. And she still likes him after that. Then he puts a baby in her and leaves. That\u2019s kinda... unsatisfactory.",

And she had multiple opportunities to do so in the situations she was in, so the problem wasn\u2019t the amount of episodes. In fact, I\u2019d say that 700 episodes is plenty (or 72 Volumes if we\u2019re going by what Kishimoto did). She could have actually resolved to try to kill Sasuke at any point. She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second. She could have had an ability pulled out of her ass like a good amount of the things the Sharingan can do. There were plenty of moments where she could have grown as a person or done something cool, but she barely did anything considering she was positioned in the story to have been a tritagonist.",

A poisoned kunai would be some straight-up Achilles bullshit.\n\nShisui got killed by poison (or rather, was driven to suicide because of the poison), and he was one of the strongest Uchiha we know about.\n\nArguably, it's a bit weird we never saw any major character actually get poisoned. Sharingan or Tailed Beast don't do anything to protect you against poison.\n\nFor real, if you wanna kill Naruto, it's probably easier to poison his ramen bowl rather than confront him in a fight.",

Your argument is that she escaped genjutsu twice... in the entire series... one of which genin were able to release.\n\nLike for real... what's going on here? Do you feel Sakura fully recognized her potential and had the agency befitting an alleged main character? Is it that you didn't want to see more of her? I really don't get why you're being hostile over this.",

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character.

It doesn't change the fact that Sasuke was an absent father and the only time he had an interaction with Sakura before his thirties was fucking her, then he went away. The only explanation to this is self preservation of his clan, nothing complicated, new Uchiha characters is fanservice. He probably didn't even have an official mariage and has still not kissed her so far. These are the realities and even if you interpret it weirdly, the moral of the story is a disaster and Sakura is a terrible character.",

Like i get the shows named \u201cNaruto\u201d and they couldve played on him giving her confidence but doesnt have to be the main motivation tbh\n\nSame with Temari who couldve made his brother\u2019s Mistreatment by his own father and as the eldest yet they aint Show one scene of that.\n\nAnd i agree about Mei, what a waste, shes the Kage that was coming out to end the Bloody Mist era and yet we aint have one scene to Show How she revolutionized that. Istg i Love this Show but How they treat women is one thing i really cant stand, they put romance as their motivation like aint these kids fighting for their damn lives and romance would be the last thing theyll be thinking, they couldve saved that shit on the last part tbh",

In fact Sakura was on a bunch of the missions in shippuden giving her more. For instance, choji, shino, and Lina got little screen time in shippuden. Heck Sakura faught an akatsuki member, who cares if it was at the beginning. Hinata marries naruto, and fights to protect him against pain, which causes the nine tails vs pain fight, so she\u2019s pretty important and gets some better scenes than a lot of the other male side characters. You\u2019re basically just mad because the girls didn\u2019t get enough showcase of their power, and think that because there\u2019s more male characters overall. I mean tsunade was the hokage ffs. Like for most of the entire series. Only good argument point would be ino or tenten, but their abilities are boring anyways don\u2019t really deserve screen time.",

I understand that she wanted to eat their chakra or something, but with either reasoning, there's still the fact that she prolonged a fight against three of the only people that could actually stop her. I mean, I get arrogance, but this is supposed to be a replacement for Madara, who kept stunting on everybody except for Guy, Naruto and Sasuke after being sort-of revived by the SOSP, and Zetsu and Kaguya herself. With the little time she had to exist in the story, comparisons between the two are kind of inevitable. She didn't do it when she actually wanted to kill them either. At least Madara knew when to take someone seriously.\n\n>And kakashi and sasuke can both travel through dimensions and naruto punches holes through them.\n\nCan they? I sorta believe the Sharingan can do that because of course it can, but I definitely don't remember Naruto punching holes in dimensions. And even then, I don't think she knew that they could do that. And even then, she could just keep putting them back considering that I assume she has more chakra than all of them. Also, lava, gravity, and acid.\n\n>Both naruto and sasuke were way to strong to be killed by natural forces like gravity or lava.\n\nYeah, no. Lava is lava, and a dimension made of lava would kill them eventually through the actual lava or dehydration. A dimension made of gravity would eventually fold their spines under the strain. A dimension made of acid would melt them. Unlike Madara and probably Kaguya, Team 7 and Obito aren't immortal, and unlike specifically the former, they don't have infinite chakra to protect them. They'd run out eventually. Although if they can travel through dimensions, then who knows what that might do.\n\n>And you do realize that this is a show that is supposed to have entertaining fights, right? Naruto could have merked boruto in his fight in half a second but he didn\u2019t because plot.\n\nI get that. And that's fair enough. But I have to ask, why would you switch out your final boss for a completely new, previously relatively unseen character with new abilities, and then give the new final boss a abilities so overpowered that they have to actively avoid doing something obvious with it so they don't instantly win? Personally, that takes away a little bit of the entertainment value from me. Although I still think the fight was cool, it didn't make me think Kaguya was cool because I kept thinking \"Why isn't she just teleporting them into the lava or something? I mean, it seems like the obvious solution to me.\"\n\n>And madara wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTrue. But he still pretty much curb-stomped the second half of the war with relatively little help. He soloed an army, the Five Kage, and the main protagonists. Obito definitely helped, but Naruto and Sasuke needed a power boost from Ninja-God to fight Madara. And Kaguya had a sleeve demon that pretty much told her what the smart thing to do was every now and again.\n\n>Juubi madara had less screen time then kaguya in pretty sure.\n\nI don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Madara had more screentime. Or at the very least, I found Kaguya to be less memorable. Not in the sense that I couldn't remember her, but in that she felt less remarkable.\n\n>Not only that but it\u2019s much easier to seal someone rather then kill them if their invincible. Madara was basically immortal since he had prettt much instant regen and was super strong. So6p naruto and rinne sasuke were destroying madara before he turned into kaguya as well.\n\nYeah, you could seal them both, and they're both immortal (at least, I think Kaguya is). But I think Madara still felt like he was more of a threat, got more done, and was all around more... interesting than Kaguya.\n\nAll in all, I think that Kaguya, while powerful, didn't really make me invest in her as much as I would have liked. This is especially apparent to me because she was essentially the final boss of the anime (not counting the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that was more of a bookends), so I feel like she's supposed to feel like more of a main event. But she kinda just upstaged Madara, stole the spotlight, and did less with it than most other villains did. At least Nagato set his own stage. Although this is just my perspective.",

Nothing can change what kishi wrote sadly. I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

Although, admittedly, Naruto had the same problem there.\n\n- Having moments where she fails to do things like kill a wanted terrorist because of the aforementioned crush after trying to force everyone else to stop pursuing him because she was going to do it herself, and failing to slash a mass-murderer\u2019s eye out so it isn\u2019t used to end the world, making me wonder how she even managed to become a Chunin.\n\n- Having a lot of her character revolve around her one-sided crush on Sasuke, and how Naruto and Sasuke outclass her in every way without really changing it at all.\n\nAll in all, while there were a few improvements, such as her training with Tsunade, it kinda got thrown away in the end. She\u2019s weaker than Naruto and Sasuke, and she always stays like that. Naruto even got better healing powers than her. She has a crush on Sasuke for no real reason other than... well, no reason. She maintains that crush after her would-be lover repeatedly calls her out on having a crush on *him* of all people, and tries to kill her, even casually knocking her out by making a Genjutsu of him killing her after she poured her heart out to him. And she still likes him after that. Then he puts a baby in her and leaves. That\u2019s kinda... unsatisfactory.",

After all there\u2019s 700 episodes of this, it\u2019s hard to be perfect.

The problem is that she barely changed, even when it would have been better, subjectively-speaking, if she had. And she had multiple opportunities to do so in the situations she was in, so the problem wasn\u2019t the amount of episodes. In fact, I\u2019d say that 700 episodes is plenty (or 72 Volumes if we\u2019re going by what Kishimoto did). She could have actually resolved to try to kill Sasuke at any point. She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second. She could have had an ability pulled out of her ass like a good amount of the things the Sharingan can do. There were plenty of moments where she could have grown as a person or done something cool, but she barely did anything considering she was positioned in the story to have been a tritagonist.",

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character. Not only she\u2019s a bad character, the author reflected his own outdated views on gender in his work.",

You still can't answer to Sakura emotionally blackmailing Naruto. \n\nRock Lee and Naruto genuinely fell in love for her, then they respected her choice and moved on. On the other hand Sakura jumped on the bandwagon of liking the cool Uchiha kid but let's say it's she was just being a child, why didn't she give up on the guy who treats her the worst in the world? Idk you should be offensed by several murder attempts if not by the crimes that person commited and if not by the insults they've thrown to you. \n\nYou can have your own headcannon and bend the reality if you want. It doesn't change the fact that Sasuke was an absent father and the only time he had an interaction with Sakura before his thirties was fucking her, then he went away. The only explanation to this is self preservation of his clan, nothing complicated, new Uchiha characters is fanservice. He probably didn't even have an official mariage and has still not kissed her so far. These are the realities and even if you interpret it weirdly, the moral of the story is a disaster and Sakura is a terrible character.",

You can't just ignore one of Naruto's flaws, its a flaw and it was bad writing on Kishi's part.",

For instance, choji, shino, and Lina got little screen time in shippuden. Heck Sakura faught an akatsuki member, who cares if it was at the beginning. Hinata marries naruto, and fights to protect him against pain, which causes the nine tails vs pain fight, so she\u2019s pretty important and gets some better scenes than a lot of the other male side characters. You\u2019re basically just mad because the girls didn\u2019t get enough showcase of their power, and think that because there\u2019s more male characters overall. I mean tsunade was the hokage ffs. Like for most of the entire series. Only good argument point would be ino or tenten, but their abilities are boring anyways don\u2019t really deserve screen time.",

                                    "body": ">For one, she was just revived, she probably wanted to have some fun.\n\nWas that implied? I understand that she wanted to eat their chakra or something, but with either reasoning, there's still the fact that she prolonged a fight against three of the only people that could actually stop her. I mean, I get arrogance, but this is supposed to be a replacement for Madara, who kept stunting on everybody except for Guy, Naruto and Sasuke after being sort-of revived by the SOSP, and Zetsu and Kaguya herself. With the little time she had to exist in the story, comparisons between the two are kind of inevitable. She didn't do it when she actually wanted to kill them either. At least Madara knew when to take someone seriously.\n\n>And kakashi and sasuke can both travel through dimensions and naruto punches holes through them.\n\nCan they? I sorta believe the Sharingan can do that because of course it can, but I definitely don't remember Naruto punching holes in dimensions. And even then, I don't think she knew that they could do that. And even then, she could just keep putting them back considering that I assume she has more chakra than all of them. Also, lava, gravity, and acid.\n\n>Both naruto and sasuke were way to strong to be killed by natural forces like gravity or lava.\n\nYeah, no. Lava is lava, and a dimension made of lava would kill them eventually through the actual lava or dehydration. A dimension made of gravity would eventually fold their spines under the strain. A dimension made of acid would melt them. Unlike Madara and probably Kaguya, Team 7 and Obito aren't immortal, and unlike specifically the former, they don't have infinite chakra to protect them. They'd run out eventually. Although if they can travel through dimensions, then who knows what that might do.\n\n>And you do realize that this is a show that is supposed to have entertaining fights, right? Naruto could have merked boruto in his fight in half a second but he didn\u2019t because plot.\n\nI get that. And that's fair enough. But I have to ask, why would you switch out your final boss for a completely new, previously relatively unseen character with new abilities, and then give the new final boss a abilities so overpowered that they have to actively avoid doing something obvious with it so they don't instantly win? Personally, that takes away a little bit of the entertainment value from me. Although I still think the fight was cool, it didn't make me think Kaguya was cool because I kept thinking \"Why isn't she just teleporting them into the lava or something? I mean, it seems like the obvious solution to me.\"\n\n>And madara wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTrue. But he still pretty much curb-stomped the second half of the war with relatively little help. He soloed an army, the Five Kage, and the main protagonists. Obito definitely helped, but Naruto and Sasuke needed a power boost from Ninja-God to fight Madara. And Kaguya had a sleeve demon that pretty much told her what the smart thing to do was every now and again.\n\n>Juubi madara had less screen time then kaguya in pretty sure.\n\nI don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Madara had more screentime. Or at the very least, I found Kaguya to be less memorable. Not in the sense that I couldn't remember her, but in that she felt less remarkable.\n\n>Not only that but it\u2019s much easier to seal someone rather then kill them if their invincible. Madara was basically immortal since he had prettt much instant regen and was super strong. So6p naruto and rinne sasuke were destroying madara before he turned into kaguya as well.\n\nYeah, you could seal them both, and they're both immortal (at least, I think Kaguya is). But I think Madara still felt like he was more of a threat, got more done, and was all around more... interesting than Kaguya.\n\nAll in all, I think that Kaguya, while powerful, didn't really make me invest in her as much as I would have liked. This is especially apparent to me because she was essentially the final boss of the anime (not counting the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that was more of a bookends), so I feel like she's supposed to feel like more of a main event. But she kinda just upstaged Madara, stole the spotlight, and did less with it than most other villains did. At least Nagato set his own stage. Although this is just my perspective.",

Nothing can change what kishi wrote sadly. I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

In fact, I\u2019d say that 700 episodes is plenty (or 72 Volumes if we\u2019re going by what Kishimoto did). She could have actually resolved to try to kill Sasuke at any point. She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second. She could have had an ability pulled out of her ass like a good amount of the things the Sharingan can do.

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character. Not only she\u2019s a bad character, the author reflected his own outdated views on gender in his work.",

There is more than enough reason for people to dislike Sakura and that should be okay. \n\nThere is like an air of elitism on both sides where we\u2019re unable to comprehend different opinions and then continue to shame each other for having said opinion. I liked that Sasori fight and was rooting for her, I think she was badass in that fight. Still wholeheartedly dislike everything about her due to a lot of things I disagree with.

I get it, people like \"swish swoosh big jutsu go boom\" and are afraid of catching cooties at the sight of a female character in their boyhood manga.

On the other hand Sakura jumped on the bandwagon of liking the cool Uchiha kid but let's say it's she was just being a child, why didn't she give up on the guy who treats her the worst in the world? Idk you should be offensed by several murder attempts if not by the crimes that person commited and if not by the insults they've thrown to you. \n\nYou can have your own headcannon and bend the reality if you want. It doesn't change the fact that Sasuke was an absent father and the only time he had an interaction with Sakura before his thirties was fucking her, then he went away. The only explanation to this is self preservation of his clan, nothing complicated, new Uchiha characters is fanservice. He probably didn't even have an official mariage and has still not kissed her so far. These are the realities and even if you interpret it weirdly, the moral of the story is a disaster and Sakura is a terrible character.",

I do agree with the side character, they get way less screentime than they should. Most prominently rock Lee. Everyone loved him back in OG Naruto, and he was having a great character arc.

                            "body": ">For one, she was just revived, she probably wanted to have some fun.\n\nWas that implied? I understand that she wanted to eat their chakra or something, but with either reasoning, there's still the fact that she prolonged a fight against three of the only people that could actually stop her. I mean, I get arrogance, but this is supposed to be a replacement for Madara, who kept stunting on everybody except for Guy, Naruto and Sasuke after being sort-of revived by the SOSP, and Zetsu and Kaguya herself. With the little time she had to exist in the story, comparisons between the two are kind of inevitable. She didn't do it when she actually wanted to kill them either. At least Madara knew when to take someone seriously.\n\n>And kakashi and sasuke can both travel through dimensions and naruto punches holes through them.\n\nCan they? I sorta believe the Sharingan can do that because of course it can, but I definitely don't remember Naruto punching holes in dimensions. And even then, I don't think she knew that they could do that. And even then, she could just keep putting them back considering that I assume she has more chakra than all of them. Also, lava, gravity, and acid.\n\n>Both naruto and sasuke were way to strong to be killed by natural forces like gravity or lava.\n\nYeah, no. Lava is lava, and a dimension made of lava would kill them eventually through the actual lava or dehydration. A dimension made of gravity would eventually fold their spines under the strain. A dimension made of acid would melt them. Unlike Madara and probably Kaguya, Team 7 and Obito aren't immortal, and unlike specifically the former, they don't have infinite chakra to protect them. They'd run out eventually. Although if they can travel through dimensions, then who knows what that might do.\n\n>And you do realize that this is a show that is supposed to have entertaining fights, right? Naruto could have merked boruto in his fight in half a second but he didn\u2019t because plot.\n\nI get that. And that's fair enough. But I have to ask, why would you switch out your final boss for a completely new, previously relatively unseen character with new abilities, and then give the new final boss a abilities so overpowered that they have to actively avoid doing something obvious with it so they don't instantly win? Personally, that takes away a little bit of the entertainment value from me. Although I still think the fight was cool, it didn't make me think Kaguya was cool because I kept thinking \"Why isn't she just teleporting them into the lava or something? I mean, it seems like the obvious solution to me.\"\n\n>And madara wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTrue. But he still pretty much curb-stomped the second half of the war with relatively little help. He soloed an army, the Five Kage, and the main protagonists. Obito definitely helped, but Naruto and Sasuke needed a power boost from Ninja-God to fight Madara. And Kaguya had a sleeve demon that pretty much told her what the smart thing to do was every now and again.\n\n>Juubi madara had less screen time then kaguya in pretty sure.\n\nI don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Madara had more screentime. Or at the very least, I found Kaguya to be less memorable. Not in the sense that I couldn't remember her, but in that she felt less remarkable.\n\n>Not only that but it\u2019s much easier to seal someone rather then kill them if their invincible. Madara was basically immortal since he had prettt much instant regen and was super strong. So6p naruto and rinne sasuke were destroying madara before he turned into kaguya as well.\n\nYeah, you could seal them both, and they're both immortal (at least, I think Kaguya is). But I think Madara still felt like he was more of a threat, got more done, and was all around more... interesting than Kaguya.\n\nAll in all, I think that Kaguya, while powerful, didn't really make me invest in her as much as I would have liked. This is especially apparent to me because she was essentially the final boss of the anime (not counting the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that was more of a bookends), so I feel like she's supposed to feel like more of a main event. But she kinda just upstaged Madara, stole the spotlight, and did less with it than most other villains did. At least Nagato set his own stage. Although this is just my perspective.",

Nothing can change what kishi wrote sadly. I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

Although, admittedly, Naruto had the same problem there.\n\n- Having moments where she fails to do things like kill a wanted terrorist because of the aforementioned crush after trying to force everyone else to stop pursuing him because she was going to do it herself, and failing to slash a mass-murderer\u2019s eye out so it isn\u2019t used to end the world, making me wonder how she even managed to become a Chunin.\n\n- Having a lot of her character revolve around her one-sided crush on Sasuke, and how Naruto and Sasuke outclass her in every way without really changing it at all.\n\nAll in all, while there were a few improvements, such as her training with Tsunade, it kinda got thrown away in the end. She\u2019s weaker than Naruto and Sasuke, and she always stays like that. Naruto even got better healing powers than her. She has a crush on Sasuke for no real reason other than... well, no reason. She maintains that crush after her would-be lover repeatedly calls her out on having a crush on *him* of all people, and tries to kill her, even casually knocking her out by making a Genjutsu of him killing her after she poured her heart out to him. And she still likes him after that. Then he puts a baby in her and leaves. That\u2019s kinda... unsatisfactory.",

And she had multiple opportunities to do so in the situations she was in, so the problem wasn\u2019t the amount of episodes. In fact, I\u2019d say that 700 episodes is plenty (or 72 Volumes if we\u2019re going by what Kishimoto did). She could have actually resolved to try to kill Sasuke at any point. She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second. She could have had an ability pulled out of her ass like a good amount of the things the Sharingan can do. There were plenty of moments where she could have grown as a person or done something cool, but she barely did anything considering she was positioned in the story to have been a tritagonist.",

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character. Not only she\u2019s a bad character, the author reflected his own outdated views on gender in his work.",

Even her good moments get shit on. \n\n>There is like an air of elitism on both sides where we\u2019re unable to comprehend different opinions and then continue to shame each other for having said opinion\n\nWhere is my elitism lol. What even is the \"other side\"? I'm just saying that's she gets criticized for way more than she should. That's not a hot take lol. Literally every other post in this sub is about how bad she is",

Maybe elitism isn\u2019t the word, English not my first language so what I really meant is the polarization around Sakura.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ll see that it is every other post because that\u2019s simply how many people dislike Sakura and there is a *huge* fan base. It would make sense as to why there is so much circulating opinion about her.",

Naruto's huge fan base plays a big role in how hated she is.\n\n>I think a lot of it is just memeing at this point but even in Japan, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s ranked dead last in terms of likability but I could be wrong about that.

Again, she absolutely could've been written better, but she's not as bad as people say",

You still can't answer to Sakura emotionally blackmailing Naruto. \n\nRock Lee and Naruto genuinely fell in love for her, then they respected her choice and moved on. On the other hand Sakura jumped on the bandwagon of liking the cool Uchiha kid but let's say it's she was just being a child, why didn't she give up on the guy who treats her the worst in the world? Idk you should be offensed by several murder attempts if not by the crimes that person commited and if not by the insults they've thrown to you. \n\nYou can have your own headcannon and bend the reality if you want. It doesn't change the fact that Sasuke was an absent father and the only time he had an interaction with Sakura before his thirties was fucking her, then he went away. The only explanation to this is self preservation of his clan, nothing complicated, new Uchiha characters is fanservice. He probably didn't even have an official mariage and has still not kissed her so far. These are the realities and even if you interpret it weirdly, the moral of the story is a disaster and Sakura is a terrible character.",

So Sakura should just be reduced to groveling in front of Naruto and Sasuke despite being one of the characters with the most screentime and being on team 7? You can't just ignore one of Naruto's flaws, its a flaw and it was bad writing on Kishi's part.",

For instance, choji, shino, and Lina got little screen time in shippuden. Heck Sakura faught an akatsuki member, who cares if it was at the beginning. Hinata marries naruto, and fights to protect him against pain, which causes the nine tails vs pain fight, so she\u2019s pretty important and gets some better scenes than a lot of the other male side characters. You\u2019re basically just mad because the girls didn\u2019t get enough showcase of their power, and think that because there\u2019s more male characters overall. I mean tsunade was the hokage ffs. Like for most of the entire series. Only good argument point would be ino or tenten, but their abilities are boring anyways don\u2019t really deserve screen time.",

                    "body": ">For one, she was just revived, she probably wanted to have some fun.\n\nWas that implied? I understand that she wanted to eat their chakra or something, but with either reasoning, there's still the fact that she prolonged a fight against three of the only people that could actually stop her. I mean, I get arrogance, but this is supposed to be a replacement for Madara, who kept stunting on everybody except for Guy, Naruto and Sasuke after being sort-of revived by the SOSP, and Zetsu and Kaguya herself. With the little time she had to exist in the story, comparisons between the two are kind of inevitable. She didn't do it when she actually wanted to kill them either. At least Madara knew when to take someone seriously.\n\n>And kakashi and sasuke can both travel through dimensions and naruto punches holes through them.\n\nCan they? I sorta believe the Sharingan can do that because of course it can, but I definitely don't remember Naruto punching holes in dimensions. And even then, I don't think she knew that they could do that. And even then, she could just keep putting them back considering that I assume she has more chakra than all of them. Also, lava, gravity, and acid.\n\n>Both naruto and sasuke were way to strong to be killed by natural forces like gravity or lava.\n\nYeah, no. Lava is lava, and a dimension made of lava would kill them eventually through the actual lava or dehydration. A dimension made of gravity would eventually fold their spines under the strain. A dimension made of acid would melt them. Unlike Madara and probably Kaguya, Team 7 and Obito aren't immortal, and unlike specifically the former, they don't have infinite chakra to protect them. They'd run out eventually. Although if they can travel through dimensions, then who knows what that might do.\n\n>And you do realize that this is a show that is supposed to have entertaining fights, right? Naruto could have merked boruto in his fight in half a second but he didn\u2019t because plot.\n\nI get that. And that's fair enough. But I have to ask, why would you switch out your final boss for a completely new, previously relatively unseen character with new abilities, and then give the new final boss a abilities so overpowered that they have to actively avoid doing something obvious with it so they don't instantly win? Personally, that takes away a little bit of the entertainment value from me. Although I still think the fight was cool, it didn't make me think Kaguya was cool because I kept thinking \"Why isn't she just teleporting them into the lava or something? I mean, it seems like the obvious solution to me.\"\n\n>And madara wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTrue. But he still pretty much curb-stomped the second half of the war with relatively little help. He soloed an army, the Five Kage, and the main protagonists. Obito definitely helped, but Naruto and Sasuke needed a power boost from Ninja-God to fight Madara. And Kaguya had a sleeve demon that pretty much told her what the smart thing to do was every now and again.\n\n>Juubi madara had less screen time then kaguya in pretty sure.\n\nI don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Madara had more screentime. Or at the very least, I found Kaguya to be less memorable. Not in the sense that I couldn't remember her, but in that she felt less remarkable.\n\n>Not only that but it\u2019s much easier to seal someone rather then kill them if their invincible. Madara was basically immortal since he had prettt much instant regen and was super strong. So6p naruto and rinne sasuke were destroying madara before he turned into kaguya as well.\n\nYeah, you could seal them both, and they're both immortal (at least, I think Kaguya is). But I think Madara still felt like he was more of a threat, got more done, and was all around more... interesting than Kaguya.\n\nAll in all, I think that Kaguya, while powerful, didn't really make me invest in her as much as I would have liked. This is especially apparent to me because she was essentially the final boss of the anime (not counting the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that was more of a bookends), so I feel like she's supposed to feel like more of a main event. But she kinda just upstaged Madara, stole the spotlight, and did less with it than most other villains did. At least Nagato set his own stage. Although this is just my perspective.",

Nothing can change what kishi wrote sadly. I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second.

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character. Not only she\u2019s a bad character, the author reflected his own outdated views on gender in his work.",

You still can't answer to Sakura emotionally blackmailing Naruto. \n\nRock Lee and Naruto genuinely fell in love for her, then they respected her choice and moved on. On the other hand Sakura jumped on the bandwagon of liking the cool Uchiha kid but let's say it's she was just being a child, why didn't she give up on the guy who treats her the worst in the world? Idk you should be offensed by several murder attempts if not by the crimes that person commited and if not by the insults they've thrown to you. \n\nYou can have your own headcannon and bend the reality if you want. It doesn't change the fact that Sasuke was an absent father and the only time he had an interaction with Sakura before his thirties was fucking her, then he went away. The only explanation to this is self preservation of his clan, nothing complicated, new Uchiha characters is fanservice. He probably didn't even have an official mariage and has still not kissed her so far. These are the realities and even if you interpret it weirdly, the moral of the story is a disaster and Sakura is a terrible character.",

            "body": ">For one, she was just revived, she probably wanted to have some fun.\n\nWas that implied? I understand that she wanted to eat their chakra or something, but with either reasoning, there's still the fact that she prolonged a fight against three of the only people that could actually stop her. I mean, I get arrogance, but this is supposed to be a replacement for Madara, who kept stunting on everybody except for Guy, Naruto and Sasuke after being sort-of revived by the SOSP, and Zetsu and Kaguya herself. With the little time she had to exist in the story, comparisons between the two are kind of inevitable. She didn't do it when she actually wanted to kill them either. At least Madara knew when to take someone seriously.\n\n>And kakashi and sasuke can both travel through dimensions and naruto punches holes through them.\n\nCan they? I sorta believe the Sharingan can do that because of course it can, but I definitely don't remember Naruto punching holes in dimensions. And even then, I don't think she knew that they could do that. And even then, she could just keep putting them back considering that I assume she has more chakra than all of them. Also, lava, gravity, and acid.\n\n>Both naruto and sasuke were way to strong to be killed by natural forces like gravity or lava.\n\nYeah, no. Lava is lava, and a dimension made of lava would kill them eventually through the actual lava or dehydration. A dimension made of gravity would eventually fold their spines under the strain. A dimension made of acid would melt them. Unlike Madara and probably Kaguya, Team 7 and Obito aren't immortal, and unlike specifically the former, they don't have infinite chakra to protect them. They'd run out eventually. Although if they can travel through dimensions, then who knows what that might do.\n\n>And you do realize that this is a show that is supposed to have entertaining fights, right? Naruto could have merked boruto in his fight in half a second but he didn\u2019t because plot.\n\nI get that. And that's fair enough. But I have to ask, why would you switch out your final boss for a completely new, previously relatively unseen character with new abilities, and then give the new final boss a abilities so overpowered that they have to actively avoid doing something obvious with it so they don't instantly win? Personally, that takes away a little bit of the entertainment value from me. Although I still think the fight was cool, it didn't make me think Kaguya was cool because I kept thinking \"Why isn't she just teleporting them into the lava or something? I mean, it seems like the obvious solution to me.\"\n\n>And madara wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nTrue. But he still pretty much curb-stomped the second half of the war with relatively little help. He soloed an army, the Five Kage, and the main protagonists. Obito definitely helped, but Naruto and Sasuke needed a power boost from Ninja-God to fight Madara. And Kaguya had a sleeve demon that pretty much told her what the smart thing to do was every now and again.\n\n>Juubi madara had less screen time then kaguya in pretty sure.\n\nI don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Madara had more screentime. Or at the very least, I found Kaguya to be less memorable. Not in the sense that I couldn't remember her, but in that she felt less remarkable.\n\n>Not only that but it\u2019s much easier to seal someone rather then kill them if their invincible. Madara was basically immortal since he had prettt much instant regen and was super strong. So6p naruto and rinne sasuke were destroying madara before he turned into kaguya as well.\n\nYeah, you could seal them both, and they're both immortal (at least, I think Kaguya is). But I think Madara still felt like he was more of a threat, got more done, and was all around more... interesting than Kaguya.\n\nAll in all, I think that Kaguya, while powerful, didn't really make me invest in her as much as I would have liked. This is especially apparent to me because she was essentially the final boss of the anime (not counting the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that was more of a bookends), so I feel like she's supposed to feel like more of a main event. But she kinda just upstaged Madara, stole the spotlight, and did less with it than most other villains did. At least Nagato set his own stage. Although this is just my perspective.",

Nothing can change what kishi wrote sadly. I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character. Not only she\u2019s a bad character, the author reflected his own outdated views on gender in his work.",

Naruto's huge fan base plays a big role in how hated she is.\n\n>I think a lot of it is just memeing at this point but even in Japan, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s ranked dead last in terms of likability but I could be wrong about that. So idk if it\u2019s an exaggeration or irrational hatred but I see a lot of reason to not like her as a character imo.\n\nI'm not sure about any polls so I can't really say either way. \n\n\nMy point was just that there are plenty of valid reasons to hate her, but people will also hate her for the good moments she has well which is what I find kinda stupid. Again, she absolutely could've been written better, but she's not as bad as people say",

Hinata marries naruto, and fights to protect him against pain, which causes the nine tails vs pain fight, so she\u2019s pretty important and gets some better scenes than a lot of the other male side characters. You\u2019re basically just mad because the girls didn\u2019t get enough showcase of their power, and think that because there\u2019s more male characters overall. I mean tsunade was the hokage ffs. Like for most of the entire series. Only good argument point would be ino or tenten, but their abilities are boring anyways don\u2019t really deserve screen time.",

I wish he never wrote boruto or handed his legacy to 3rd rate writers but I can\u2019t change that. The problem with madara is that kishi made him too strong and didn\u2019t know how to defeat him, so he had to buff naruto and sasuke. He wasn\u2019t prepared and sadly it just shows that he got as lazy as the boruto writers. Just buff after nerf after buff after nerf, it\u2019s sad to see. And yeah kakashi can use kamui, kamui it\u2019s self gives the user access to his own dimension from that dimension he can go pretty much anywhere from earth to Mars I\u2019m pretty sure lol, obito used kamui many times to teleport. An example was him going from the akatsuki hideout to the hidden rain with kamui. And he even spawned ninja tools from his dimension. I don\u2019t know how dms kakashi compares to 1ms obito but I think he can atleast use kamui like obito with the buff. And sasukes unique rinnegan ability was teleportation, he later was able to create real portals between dimensions. And both naruto and sasuke have tanked jutsus with susanoo and kuruma avatar that far surpass lava or acid and even gravity, and you can\u2019t really apply human logic to naruto because realistically no human can move faster then the human eye can see,cit would kill you pretty fast, yet both naruto and sasuke have fought and near light speed or even ftl so human logic don\u2019t apply. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, good discussion, good night.",

In fact, I\u2019d say that 700 episodes is plenty (or 72 Volumes if we\u2019re going by what Kishimoto did). She could have actually resolved to try to kill Sasuke at any point. She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second. She could have had an ability pulled out of her ass like a good amount of the things the Sharingan can do.

I think we can agree on that Sakura is infamously one of the most disliked and mocked characters in Naruto, and possibly, in all manga, given how popular the franchise is. And sadly that comes with unwarranted hatred that oftentimes turns misogynistic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I remind people it\u2019s Kishimoto\u2018s fault she sucks, because for more than a decade now I\u2019ve seen incessant vitriol against her. I seek to redirect the vitriol (people calling her a \u201cuseless bitch\u201d) to a discussion about how bad she is BECAUSE Kishimoto mishandled her and basically all other female characters.\n\nBut the hatred bordering on misogyny lashed against Sakura is, to an extent, a reflection of the misogyny permeating the whole Naruto franchise in general. She was written by a misogynistic man, so besides being weak and boring, she\u2019ll be considered hateful to  some people as she embodies negative gender stereotypes associated with women. I recommend watching this video that goes deeper in this topic: [How Naruto Failed Its Female Characters.](https://youtu.be/wNB05gdWRkI)\n\nLike I said in other comment, male side characters like Rock Lee, Gaara, Neji, Itachi and even the villains got much better treatment than Sakura, the only female main character. Not only she\u2019s a bad character, the author reflected his own outdated views on gender in his work.",

In fact, I\u2019d say that 700 episodes is plenty (or 72 Volumes if we\u2019re going by what Kishimoto did). She could have actually resolved to try to kill Sasuke at any point. She could have followed up on some of that \u201cGenjutsu talent\u201d that the story foreshadowed for a second. She could have had an ability pulled out of her ass like a good amount of the things the Sharingan can do. There were plenty of moments where she could have grown as a person or done something cool, but she barely did anything considering she was positioned in the story to have been a tritagonist.",
