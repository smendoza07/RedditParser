Frankly I find the Daimyo system stupid though, they were the cause of the warring states period.",

No homo.\n\nPeople here want to justify Sasuke cuz he had some ptsd shit or something. But ptsd or not, wanting to kill ur sensei with the same move he taught you is fucked up. Abandoning your comrades on Battlefield is just low key. Fuck Sasuke. Yeah itachi did genocide. not justifying it. But atleast he valued his agenda. Unlike this jerk who has no morale.",

Infiltration, data gathering, etc. He\u2019s still deeply battle oriented. I\u2019d argue that he wasn\u2019t meant to be a Kage either but they had to choose someone and he was closest to a Kage position. \nJiraiya\u2019s battle presence was a pretty big deal. Kisame didn\u2019t want anything to do with him when they met. \n\nIdk it\u2019s all speculation",

Kiba never could have done any of that because he isn't powerful enough. Naruto was born with the tools he needed to earn the title Hokage. Kiba could try having a heart to heart with the 5 kage and some rogue nin and he'd just be dead or laughed at.

No homo.\n\nPeople here want to justify Sasuke cuz he had some ptsd shit or something. But ptsd or not, wanting to kill ur sensei with the same move he taught you is fucked up. Abandoning your comrades on Battlefield is just low key. Fuck Sasuke. Yeah itachi did genocide. not justifying it. But atleast he valued his agenda. Unlike this jerk who has no morale.",

Infiltration, data gathering, etc. He\u2019s still deeply battle oriented. I\u2019d argue that he wasn\u2019t meant to be a Kage either but they had to choose someone and he was closest to a Kage position. \nJiraiya\u2019s battle presence was a pretty big deal. Kisame didn\u2019t want anything to do with him when they met. \n\nIdk it\u2019s all speculation",

Kiba can only say one of these things. He never stood a chance. Inversely Naruto was slated to be top ninja from birth.\n\nEdit: I said Kiba can only say 1 of these things.

Kiba never could have done any of that because he isn't powerful enough. Naruto was born with the tools he needed to earn the title Hokage. Kiba could try having a heart to heart with the 5 kage and some rogue nin and he'd just be dead or laughed at.

Sasuke didn't mean it the same way though, he said the Hokage is the one that accepts all the hate and he was going to be enemy of the world as long as it wanted one. That way they'd stop fighting each other.\n\nAnd it's not the same, the Hokage is the highest military position. Frankly I find the Daimyo system stupid though, they were the cause of the warring states period.",

Infiltration, data gathering, etc. He\u2019s still deeply battle oriented. I\u2019d argue that he wasn\u2019t meant to be a Kage either but they had to choose someone and he was closest to a Kage position. \nJiraiya\u2019s battle presence was a pretty big deal. Kisame didn\u2019t want anything to do with him when they met. \n\nIdk it\u2019s all speculation",

Kiba never could have done any of that because he isn't powerful enough. Naruto was born with the tools he needed to earn the title Hokage. Kiba could try having a heart to heart with the 5 kage and some rogue nin and he'd just be dead or laughed at. You can't be hokage without being at least one of the most powerful ninja in the village, even if that's not what its supposed to be about.",

Abandoning your comrades on Battlefield is just low key. Fuck Sasuke. Yeah itachi did genocide. not justifying it. But atleast he valued his agenda. Unlike this jerk who has no morale.",

The ninja world only gives Naruto a chance because he's extremely powerful(either that or Naruto only lives long enough to form such relations because he's powerful ie. Garra and Nagato). Kiba never could have done any of that because he isn't powerful enough. Naruto was born with the tools he needed to earn the title Hokage. Kiba could try having a heart to heart with the 5 kage and some rogue nin and he'd just be dead or laughed at. You can't be hokage without being at least one of the most powerful ninja in the village, even if that's not what its supposed to be about.",
