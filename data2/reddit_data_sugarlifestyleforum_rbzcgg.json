    "body": "After 7 years in the bowl and 100+ meetings, I\u2019ve finalized the steps to be a sugar daddy and sugar date attractive college-aged women.\n\nIf you\u2019re a busy guy running a business, with a successful career, or with some fun hobbies you\u2019re going to love this process. You\u2019re paying money for this so it\u2019ll be easy peesy, set and forget \n\nSteps \n1. sign up for SA. Pay your membership fee and start sending messages. Many of the women will be of lower attractiveness than you will match with on a vanilla dating app but still expect that spoiling. Spend your time sorting.\n\n2. Send likely 100+ back-and-forth messages every couple weeks to the few women you find attractive. Find that many of them created a profile on whim and never will login again. Find that many others have no idea how to have a sugar relationship or want platonic or online-only (\u201cbuy pics\u201d?)\n\n3. Text to try to schedule a date. Find that many of them are impossible to meet up with or have no time in their schedule. It\u2019s like they never even thought they\u2019d have to meet up! Find that others are PROs and just want to meet in a hotel that very night. \n\n4. Schedule date, find that many ask you to send money to them even before meeting (rinsers). There\u2019s apparently a shocking number that need fifty bucks to turn their cell phone back on so they can meet you \n\n5. Go on date with those that make it through the above steps. Expect for SBs to cancel last minute, be 30 min to an hour late, and sometimes show up completely under-dressed, not wearing makeup or otherwise putting minimal effort into the date. Expect to drive much of the conversation and for it to be like pulling teeth sometimes. Expect that many of them will also then ask (demand) for money at the end of the platonic date regardless if you are interested or not in them \n\n6. Of those that you like enough from the first date, try to start an arrangement and schedule another date with an allowance. Find that many of them are shocked at this stage that you wanted intimacy despite wanting an allowance and you being upfront about a needed mutual physical attraction. Find that many SBs feel this is too close to sex work for their liking \n\n7. Of those that get the dynamic, find that some of them are totally sexually boring and you\u2019ll quickly lose the attraction. Others have terrible personalities that wear on you and make dates no fun\n\n8. Eventually land on one or two that you enjoy, you\u2019re attracted to and who understand the dynamic. Success\n\n9. Spend up to tens of thousands on them plus gifts. \n\n10. Find that many of them are unable to keep a regular meetup schedule or even see you regularly. Find that others get too attached, have major personal life drama that bleeds into your life, or that they otherwise become a drain on the experience\n\n11. You or SB end things. You\u2019ve maybe given her more than anyone else in her life (outside family).  You\u2019ve hopefully gotten some great dates with someone gorgeous you became attached to. \n\n12. Repeat, go to number 1, because you had so much fun the first time\n\nThis is obviously snark and there are some great experiences to be had, but point is the bowl is really a shit show and really becoming barely worth it for any guy with other things in life",

And here in Spain it's the same: girls who disappear after two days, girls who after days of conversation don't dare to meet, girls who meet and you get a big disappointment because of their personality, girls who shortly before the date ask you for money in advance and if you tell them nicely no, they get offended or act aggrieved,... Girls that you get to bed with them and they suffer or are not at all participative, girls that seem wonderful but after three or four dates they \"don't feel ready\"... Uffffff, complicated world, and complicated job the one of Sugar Datting. But when you finnally get the girl... please don let her run away, my friend!!",

And this is very true for social situations. Though, if I dress better than usual, I'm more \"on\" and focused on selling my personality.\n\nFor students and creatives; as well as, really all of the the GenZ/youngest Milennial group, they might socialize dressed in a relaxed way.\n\nIf I could have everyone show up exactly as they dress normal, and no extra (and even no) makeup, I personally would like this best.\n\nSo -- the question: I know you were leaning into writing in an entertaining way (and succeeded,) but is there a formula reason for wanting the higher-caliber dress and makeup. Specifically, are you finding there is a correlation between this level of effort and the POT' internal processing that this SB /SD is getting real and that events are carrying them forward to a deal?",

Some salesperson in NYC with a grad degree from MIT will do better in tech device sales than another salesperson at the same company in Michigan with a state degree. These variances have nothing to do with whether the system design is good.\n\n\\--\n\nIf I can press a bit deeper on your casual vs dress reply (which was richly detailed and spot-on a direct response:)\n\n...And I realize there's no way you would have a solid answer for this ....so just intuitvely....:\n\nDo you find that how they dress -- even badly -- has any correlation to whether things work out with them? Young women have chaotic lives -- juggling so much stuff -- and their showing up, to my view (until you correct me, which I would appreciate) is their way of showing you that they really wanted to meet you. Otherwise they would have cancelled, realizing they just didn't have the focus/breathing room to get all the right pieces together....they don't have time to dress or brush their teeth.\n\nTo my view, the examples you give show someone who really wanted to meet you....hence I'm wondering if there is even a positivie correlation between the people who can barely pull it off to get there (making things work even though they are barefly above water.)\n\nThere's a cool scene in one of Will Smith's movies which underscores this point -- that, sometimes, if someone shows up to a stress meeting and they know they don't look their best, it's that they *really* want to be there. \n\n[https://youtu.be/UUDKEbX5OQw](https://youtu.be/UUDKEbX5OQw) (link to scene)",

While your counter argument is valid, showing up dressed so casually you may as well be wearing pjs, and have it reasoned as \"yes but she/they *really really* want to be there, because you're important!\" Just really isn't right. \n\nShowing up because you really want to be there is of course the truth. That is the point of the meeting. And yes, our lives do get chaotic. I will openly admit I've done similar things, (though not perhaps to such an extent where I showed up to an important meeting in slippers and sweats) where I prioritized comfort over aesthetic. \n\nBut if, as you say, this woman/person really and truly felt you as the POT were so important that they had to meet you no matter what, they should have still put in effort. \n\nI didn't memories which number this is under, but if the lady that OP mentioned in his earlier replies, woke up 5mins before their meeting, she could have called (hoping she did) to apologize for being tardy, and that she'd be there in XY minutes. \n\nGiving herself enough time to run some dry shampoo through her hair, put on some light make up, picked a nicer outfit, brushed her teeth, and met OP looking like she wanted to be there and *showing* that she wanted to be there. \n\nIt happens. Sometimes life is cruel to all your carefully laid out plans. \n\nBut regardless, meeting a POT for the 1st time is really more akin to a job interview (hence the stress). And I don't know about other women, but even if I didn't want to be there, I'd still show up, and be dressed appropriately. \n\nI never got to be an SB though I've always wanted to be one. I wouldn't have minded the intimacy, and honestly an allowance would have helped so many of my current financial issues. \n\nBut SB type relationships aren't really a thing in my country. Well, they are, but only with a very very specific looking type of woman, and sadly, I am not such a woman. And online SDs are majorly a scam, and not plausible anyway because of the long distance. \n\nBut I know that had I been lucky enough to have someone interested in me like that, I would have put in the maximum of all efforts. Because they chose me, and chose to help me. And the next best thing I can do to show gratitude is do my best to meet their expectations and make them happy and content. \n\nSo sad that some women take this chance for granted. \n\nSorry for the rant \ud83d\ude05",

Which is why I said what I do on the side shouldn't have had any bearing to what I was referring to in my previous comments.

So I asked for that money before going to meet him, even the first time. If you are going to do this just ask for photo proof that they are headed to you if you\u2019re suspicious \n2) you want to prove to her that you are not a time waster/Splenda daddy. Maybe send her $25 for her weekly Starbucks or $60 to get her nails done.\nApparently there\u2019s a lot of scammers on SA now but I remember how good and cared for this made me feel when my SD did this before we had even met :). Some of you might say that it was a rookie move but it sealed the deal for me and made me feel comfortable enough to take the plunge and go meet my first SD!",

Some salesperson in NYC with a grad degree from MIT will do better in tech device sales than another salesperson at the same company in Michigan with a state degree. These variances have nothing to do with whether the system design is good.\n\n\\--\n\nIf I can press a bit deeper on your casual vs dress reply (which was richly detailed and spot-on a direct response:)\n\n...And I realize there's no way you would have a solid answer for this ....so just intuitvely....:\n\nDo you find that how they dress -- even badly -- has any correlation to whether things work out with them? Young women have chaotic lives -- juggling so much stuff -- and their showing up, to my view (until you correct me, which I would appreciate) is their way of showing you that they really wanted to meet you. Otherwise they would have cancelled, realizing they just didn't have the focus/breathing room to get all the right pieces together....they don't have time to dress or brush their teeth.\n\nTo my view, the examples you give show someone who really wanted to meet you....hence I'm wondering if there is even a positivie correlation between the people who can barely pull it off to get there (making things work even though they are barefly above water.)\n\nThere's a cool scene in one of Will Smith's movies which underscores this point -- that, sometimes, if someone shows up to a stress meeting and they know they don't look their best, it's that they *really* want to be there. \n\n[https://youtu.be/UUDKEbX5OQw](https://youtu.be/UUDKEbX5OQw) (link to scene)",

While your counter argument is valid, showing up dressed so casually you may as well be wearing pjs, and have it reasoned as \"yes but she/they *really really* want to be there, because you're important!\" Just really isn't right. \n\nShowing up because you really want to be there is of course the truth. That is the point of the meeting. And yes, our lives do get chaotic. I will openly admit I've done similar things, (though not perhaps to such an extent where I showed up to an important meeting in slippers and sweats) where I prioritized comfort over aesthetic. \n\nBut if, as you say, this woman/person really and truly felt you as the POT were so important that they had to meet you no matter what, they should have still put in effort. \n\nI didn't memories which number this is under, but if the lady that OP mentioned in his earlier replies, woke up 5mins before their meeting, she could have called (hoping she did) to apologize for being tardy, and that she'd be there in XY minutes. \n\nGiving herself enough time to run some dry shampoo through her hair, put on some light make up, picked a nicer outfit, brushed her teeth, and met OP looking like she wanted to be there and *showing* that she wanted to be there. \n\nIt happens. Sometimes life is cruel to all your carefully laid out plans. \n\nBut regardless, meeting a POT for the 1st time is really more akin to a job interview (hence the stress). And I don't know about other women, but even if I didn't want to be there, I'd still show up, and be dressed appropriately. \n\nI never got to be an SB though I've always wanted to be one. I wouldn't have minded the intimacy, and honestly an allowance would have helped so many of my current financial issues. \n\nBut SB type relationships aren't really a thing in my country. Well, they are, but only with a very very specific looking type of woman, and sadly, I am not such a woman. And online SDs are majorly a scam, and not plausible anyway because of the long distance. \n\nBut I know that had I been lucky enough to have someone interested in me like that, I would have put in the maximum of all efforts. Because they chose me, and chose to help me. And the next best thing I can do to show gratitude is do my best to meet their expectations and make them happy and content. \n\nSo sad that some women take this chance for granted. \n\nSorry for the rant \ud83d\ude05",

This a snarky slice at the difficulties that come with it, mostly so newer SDs can see where it fails. I like sugaring enough to keep at it; the successes make it worth it\n\nSBs should always ask \u201cwhy isn\u2019t this guy just vanilla dating instead of spending money\u201d. For me, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s boyfriend or spend a huge amount of time together. I would vanilla date if I wanted that. So yes, I want a relationship with less attachment than a GF and I think that should be okay in sugaring. I don\u2019t like when SBs don\u2019t respect that",

            "body": "One reason why some commenters to your post seem to be missing the point -- or overlooking the point -- is that you seem to have high level sales experience.\n\nOne aspect I find immensely useful/clarifying is that you've structured the process into the sort of sales system that helps put the right context to the minute-by-minute ups and downs of what is a meandering, rejection-filled and circular process.\n\nWhat's not your point is whether X salesperson (SD) has Y or Z level of relative efficiency. Some salesperson in NYC with a grad degree from MIT will do better in tech device sales than another salesperson at the same company in Michigan with a state degree. These variances have nothing to do with whether the system design is good.\n\n\\--\n\nIf I can press a bit deeper on your casual vs dress reply (which was richly detailed and spot-on a direct response:)\n\n...And I realize there's no way you would have a solid answer for this ....so just intuitvely....:\n\nDo you find that how they dress -- even badly -- has any correlation to whether things work out with them? Young women have chaotic lives -- juggling so much stuff -- and their showing up, to my view (until you correct me, which I would appreciate) is their way of showing you that they really wanted to meet you. Otherwise they would have cancelled, realizing they just didn't have the focus/breathing room to get all the right pieces together....they don't have time to dress or brush their teeth.\n\nTo my view, the examples you give show someone who really wanted to meet you....hence I'm wondering if there is even a positivie correlation between the people who can barely pull it off to get there (making things work even though they are barefly above water.)\n\nThere's a cool scene in one of Will Smith's movies which underscores this point -- that, sometimes, if someone shows up to a stress meeting and they know they don't look their best, it's that they *really* want to be there. \n\n[https://youtu.be/UUDKEbX5OQw](https://youtu.be/UUDKEbX5OQw) (link to scene)",

While your counter argument is valid, showing up dressed so casually you may as well be wearing pjs, and have it reasoned as \"yes but she/they *really really* want to be there, because you're important!\" Just really isn't right. \n\nShowing up because you really want to be there is of course the truth. That is the point of the meeting. And yes, our lives do get chaotic. I will openly admit I've done similar things, (though not perhaps to such an extent where I showed up to an important meeting in slippers and sweats) where I prioritized comfort over aesthetic. \n\nBut if, as you say, this woman/person really and truly felt you as the POT were so important that they had to meet you no matter what, they should have still put in effort. \n\nI didn't memories which number this is under, but if the lady that OP mentioned in his earlier replies, woke up 5mins before their meeting, she could have called (hoping she did) to apologize for being tardy, and that she'd be there in XY minutes. \n\nGiving herself enough time to run some dry shampoo through her hair, put on some light make up, picked a nicer outfit, brushed her teeth, and met OP looking like she wanted to be there and *showing* that she wanted to be there. \n\nIt happens. Sometimes life is cruel to all your carefully laid out plans. \n\nBut regardless, meeting a POT for the 1st time is really more akin to a job interview (hence the stress). And I don't know about other women, but even if I didn't want to be there, I'd still show up, and be dressed appropriately. \n\nI never got to be an SB though I've always wanted to be one. I wouldn't have minded the intimacy, and honestly an allowance would have helped so many of my current financial issues. \n\nBut SB type relationships aren't really a thing in my country. Well, they are, but only with a very very specific looking type of woman, and sadly, I am not such a woman. And online SDs are majorly a scam, and not plausible anyway because of the long distance. \n\nBut I know that had I been lucky enough to have someone interested in me like that, I would have put in the maximum of all efforts. Because they chose me, and chose to help me. And the next best thing I can do to show gratitude is do my best to meet their expectations and make them happy and content. \n\nSo sad that some women take this chance for granted. \n\nSorry for the rant \ud83d\ude05",

While your counter argument is valid, showing up dressed so casually you may as well be wearing pjs, and have it reasoned as \"yes but she/they *really really* want to be there, because you're important!\" Just really isn't right. \n\nShowing up because you really want to be there is of course the truth. That is the point of the meeting. And yes, our lives do get chaotic. I will openly admit I've done similar things, (though not perhaps to such an extent where I showed up to an important meeting in slippers and sweats) where I prioritized comfort over aesthetic. \n\nBut if, as you say, this woman/person really and truly felt you as the POT were so important that they had to meet you no matter what, they should have still put in effort. \n\nI didn't memories which number this is under, but if the lady that OP mentioned in his earlier replies, woke up 5mins before their meeting, she could have called (hoping she did) to apologize for being tardy, and that she'd be there in XY minutes. \n\nGiving herself enough time to run some dry shampoo through her hair, put on some light make up, picked a nicer outfit, brushed her teeth, and met OP looking like she wanted to be there and *showing* that she wanted to be there. \n\nIt happens. Sometimes life is cruel to all your carefully laid out plans. \n\nBut regardless, meeting a POT for the 1st time is really more akin to a job interview (hence the stress). And I don't know about other women, but even if I didn't want to be there, I'd still show up, and be dressed appropriately. \n\nI never got to be an SB though I've always wanted to be one. I wouldn't have minded the intimacy, and honestly an allowance would have helped so many of my current financial issues. \n\nBut SB type relationships aren't really a thing in my country. Well, they are, but only with a very very specific looking type of woman, and sadly, I am not such a woman. And online SDs are majorly a scam, and not plausible anyway because of the long distance. \n\nBut I know that had I been lucky enough to have someone interested in me like that, I would have put in the maximum of all efforts. Because they chose me, and chose to help me. And the next best thing I can do to show gratitude is do my best to meet their expectations and make them happy and content. \n\nSo sad that some women take this chance for granted. \n\nSorry for the rant \ud83d\ude05",
