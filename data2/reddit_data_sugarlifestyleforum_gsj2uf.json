A humble brag?  \n\nHe clearly put No Sex as the first two words - so he was trying to emphasize that.  Manipulation is perhaps too strong of a word - but it seems aimed at something.  It was intentional.  Either karma, fishing for DMs, just to stir the pot and see a reaction.  \n\nChecking his post history, now I'm wondering if it's a honey pot attempt.
