    "body": "I\u2019m gonna get blasted for this probably, but idgaf. \n\nGround rules: if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. SDs, this affects you too and you should be ashamed if you think forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy she doesn\u2019t want is appropriate. \n\nTo all the SBs who are [grieving the loss of your rights today](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/supreme-court-decision-roe-v-wade-6-24-2022), please know that I\u2019m here for you and sending you a virtual hug if you want one. We\u2019re in this together and you deserve to have autonomy over your life and your body. \n\nIt\u2019s an important issue in the bowl since this is something that happens (and we\u2019ve seen it happen). \n\nI know some of you are gonna say \u201cwell it doesn\u2019t affect you if you still have access or can travel\u201d and that\u2019s still a shit take.\n\nLove you all and sending you good vibes to stay safe and that your birth control never fails. SDs step up that pull out game while it\u2019s wrapped up and make that appt to get snipped. Don\u2019t put your SB at unnecessary risk. \n\nMy DMs are open if anyone wants to talk or needs support.\n\nEdit to add: thank you all for supporting others and the awards. Please make sure you donate to your local communities and organize. Give the people who can make a difference your support. Your wallets really have the power here. \n\nFor those of you celebrating or saying that this isn\u2019t that bad: marital privacy is on the chopping block now (looking at you married SDs). So are interracial marriages and relationships. So is sodomy (anal). You\u2019ve been warned. Your GOP doesn\u2019t care about you or your kids.",

Many other states are enacting laws that ban abortion after 6 weeks\u2026the time by which a woman would even know she\u2019s pregnant. \n\nThe TRUTH imo is they need more workers.

However, the left has relied on the fact that the courts leaned left for 50 years to push progressive policy through laws dictated from the bench. It doesn't work that way. \n\nHopefully this will function as a wake up call and the left will finally start doing the compromising they need to push for legitimate change. It's slower, harder, but it is far more lasting. Now that the courts are far to the right, get ready for most of the social progress made over the last century to be undone.",

That gives them too much power they are making a choice for 3 people not just themselves. If they have the right to terminate pregnancies at will then men shouldn't have to foot the bill if they choose to keep the kid. You all may think that affects just you but I had a gf who got an abortion with my child when I was young and she did tell me til afterwards. Fast forward 15 years and I haven't had a kid with anyone else and am pretty lonely/depressed. The decision doesn't only affect you but everyone else involved. And if you look at it in a black and white kind of way is murdering a baby for your own personal preferences right or wrong? I think we all know the answer to that.",
