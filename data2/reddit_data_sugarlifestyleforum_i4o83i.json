    "body": "I decided to give the sugar thing one more try, maybe my last. I wanted to give those new to the bowl, or anyone who doesn't fit the traditional SB image, hope. Stay true to you, and put your best attributes forward (personality counts!). I was ready to try vanilla dating, that's a no go now, so I thought why not sugar (I've had several arrangements over the years). I genuinely miss the company of a man and I have a bit of experience with kink so that's my angle in part.\n\nI decided to push forward, stop the POT's who endlessly chat, focus on the local ones who really want to meet, vetting the ones who I have compatibility with. One maybe two calls, a video meet, discuss allowance and then a platonic in person M & G. So, after a long dry spell I met two POT's one day apart. One younger close to my age who gave me 1/2 of a generous monthly allowance upfront (he offered and he came through)  and we had a nice dinner too! & the other in his 70's (his first time doing this) where I drove to him, some 30 miles, but as such he offered to help with gas/toll/time. He did this and doubled it as a gesture. I hope one or both will manifest, a hopeful sign! With the first POT, he's done this before, the older gentleman was overwhelmed by it all as he's new so he may back out, but I'm open to exploring as well;) I'll update in a couple of weeks!",

            "body": "Congrats! And you\u2019re right, personality definitely counts. Not only does it count, I\u2019d argue it is more of factor than physical appeal when it comes to long term. In the context of sugar dating, there\u2019s no shortage of beautiful women to engage with. If you\u2019re an \u201cabove average\u201d woman with a warm, engaging, personality that can wield the flirt and attention in a man\u2019s direction, you can do this SR thing well beyond the perceived \u201ctoo old\u201d time frame. Who cares if you get fewer messages? Those of us serious about SRs are looking for signals (hint: expressive profile with window into your personality and good pictures). \n\nI feel like this needs to said so everyone is processing the landscape via an accurate portrayal. Ladies, when in doubt if you have what it takes in looks and age department to attract legit SDs, keep this one important fact in mind to help keep you from getting disenchanted. While the ratio of SB to legit SD seems stacked against you, the 10-1 ratio in reality is 90% of this.\n\n\u201cI know my worth\u201d\n\u201cTime is money\u201d\n\u201cSpoil me like the princess/queen I am\u201d\n\u201cLet me be your arm candy\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a great listener\u201d\n\u201cOnline only until I\u2019m comfortable\u201d\n\u201cShow me that you\u2019re real\u201d\n\u201cSerious offers only\u201d\n\u201cTrying something new\u201d\n\u201cBaby looking for a daddy\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just off the top of my head. Now, does that look like stiff competition to you? The hardest part is this is the volume of noise we have to sift through to find someone that is a keeper. Make that profile count and with a basic headline like \u201clooking for traditional SR\u201d not only qualifies as original, it may as well be a big, shiny, spotlight in a sea of darkness. I hope this helps to illustrate why OP\u2019s success wasn\u2019t because she got lucky. At the end of the day, she\u2019s the ideal person we\u2019re actually looking for.",
