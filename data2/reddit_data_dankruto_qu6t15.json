Ignore the actual argument and derail it by pointing out how a mf in a universe with people who are supposed to have special abilities can beat my ass. \n\nHe's a ninja, He's supposed to be able to beat a regular dude's ass. It would be sad if he couldn't. It doesn't change the fact that your man crush is a weak ass ninja though. \n\nWe get it, Iruka cowering behind kid Naruto saving his bitch ass is your screensaver, and you like to pull on Iruka's ponytail when you hit from the back, but it doesn't change the fact that he's a weak ass ninja. That's why he is stuck in a classroom and no one is asking him to do any missions.",

Ignore the actual argument and derail it by pointing out how a mf in a universe with people who are supposed to have special abilities can beat my ass. \n\nHe's a ninja, He's supposed to be able to beat a regular dude's ass. It would be sad if he couldn't. It doesn't change the fact that your man crush is a weak ass ninja though. \n\nWe get it, Iruka cowering behind kid Naruto saving his bitch ass is your screensaver, and you like to pull on Iruka's ponytail when you hit from the back, but it doesn't change the fact that he's a weak ass ninja. That's why he is stuck in a classroom and no one is asking him to do any missions.",
