Dermatologist for hairloss asap, at your age it could be a vitamin defiency or your hormones, so going to a endocrinologist could be the key, the bloodtest they ask for is more specific than regular doctors, its the common bloodtest + hormone levels. Do not despair, there are treatments for alopecia.  \nBut also, you are very young, you can shave now, its a shock at first but everyone (including you) gets used to it. You can buzzcut while you do the treatment.",

Then they shake the mixture as part of a process called \u201cpotentization.\u201d They believe this step transfers the healing essence. Homeopaths also believe that the lower the dose, the more powerful the medicine. In fact, many of these remedies no longer contain any molecules of the original substance. They come in a variety of forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of the above sounds like something a reasonable person would do - rethink what you think a reasonable person is.",
