There was no such distinction between or even mention of not being an uzumaki in the manga or anime, mainly because Naruto did not know the significance of it. The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me. This whole discussion is something that I don't want to participate in lol.",

Each of the Sage's sons had half his chakra and N/S being their reincarnations had half his chakra.  When he met them in the 4th war, he gave them the half they were missing which unlocked their six paths powers. Sasuke(Indra) was given Asura's power which awakened his rinnegan and Naruto(Asura) was given Indra's which unlocked six paths sage mode.",

There was no such distinction between or even mention of not being an uzumaki in the manga or anime, mainly because Naruto did not know the significance of it. The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me. This whole discussion is something that I don't want to participate in lol.",

There was no such distinction between or even mention of not being an uzumaki in the manga or anime, mainly because Naruto did not know the significance of it. The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me. This whole discussion is something that I don't want to participate in lol.",

There was no such distinction between or even mention of not being an uzumaki in the manga or anime, mainly because Naruto did not know the significance of it. The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me. This whole discussion is something that I don't want to participate in lol.",

Each of the Sage's sons had half his chakra and N/S being their reincarnations had half his chakra.  When he met them in the 4th war, he gave them the half they were missing which unlocked their six paths powers. Sasuke(Indra) was given Asura's power which awakened his rinnegan and Naruto(Asura) was given Indra's which unlocked six paths sage mode.",

There was no such distinction between or even mention of not being an uzumaki in the manga or anime, mainly because Naruto did not know the significance of it. The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me. This whole discussion is something that I don't want to participate in lol.",

Which is why they have high reserves. No one in the series ever inherited his chakra in it's fullest.",

The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me.

The Japanese and Chinese are notorious for their emphasis on inheritance of name and family, so it was unlikely that a name, that the first hokage's wife shared would be given to a so called \"no name\" orphan. \n\n\nAlso, Its unlikely that Nagato himself knew much about the Uzumakis since he was orphaned in war, spent time with Jiraya, and then went back into the Civil war in Ame against Hanzo the Salamander(?). He likely never had time to study about his origins, so it would not have mattered if he knew that naruto was an uzumaki. Its more likely that he forgot about his surname since he was a four fucking year old kid in the middle of the war.\n\n\nEdit: Ignore me.

Kushina if she had to fight Minato would likely win since in addition to the chains, she still has the other clan powers of the Uzumaki clan like the accelerated healing.",
