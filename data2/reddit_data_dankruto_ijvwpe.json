Even though he was not stronger he was still a legend, a genius, the only person in the series who could use sharingan to that extent being a non uchiha. A genius who created his own jutsu when he was a kid. The youngest person to graduate the academy. Even if he has no info about the opponent he can still find his weakness in middle of a battle and make a plan to defeat him on the spot. Even if he never got his sharingan he would have been a legend. Sharingan is a double edged sword for a non uchiha. And Kakashi after war arc is the strongest version of Kakashi who has abundant Chakra and knows over 1000 jutsus. There are hardly and characters like Kakashi who even used his mangekyo with his own free will and Chakra. And in the war we have seen him outsmart someone like obito many times who was stronger than itachi. \n\n>Itachi soloed kakashi, Naruto, Sakura and the old lady with 1/5th of his power and almost won.\n\nI know itachi is strong but I didn't see him completely dominating all three with his 1/5 th power. They were just alert. They didn't want to let their guard down. I didn't see him doing any noticeable damage other than the genjutsu on naruto. The same happened with kisame and gai. But u can't say that gai was weak.",

U can see her true purpose and importance in the war arc where it was needed the most, and it wasn't about fighting.\n\nEven despite it Ino's fighting skills with her strategies aren't something to be underestimated either. maybe not at hidan and kakuzu's arc but later on.",

And if you don't win against him then I can pretty much tell you the same thing you said about naruto. Because that's the same case with  sage naruto vs rinnegan madara. The difference in power is too huge. But later on he gets so strong that he one shots madara with lava rasenshuriken leaving him on verge of death and forcing him to absorb the whole tree.\n\nYou clearly didn't understand the show.

Even though he was not stronger he was still a legend, a genius, the only person in the series who could use sharingan to that extent being a non uchiha. A genius who created his own jutsu when he was a kid. The youngest person to graduate the academy. Even if he has no info about the opponent he can still find his weakness in middle of a battle and make a plan to defeat him on the spot. Even if he never got his sharingan he would have been a legend. Sharingan is a double edged sword for a non uchiha. And Kakashi after war arc is the strongest version of Kakashi who has abundant Chakra and knows over 1000 jutsus. There are hardly and characters like Kakashi who even used his mangekyo with his own free will and Chakra. And in the war we have seen him outsmart someone like obito many times who was stronger than itachi. \n\n>Itachi soloed kakashi, Naruto, Sakura and the old lady with 1/5th of his power and almost won.\n\nI know itachi is strong but I didn't see him completely dominating all three with his 1/5 th power. They were just alert. They didn't want to let their guard down. I didn't see him doing any noticeable damage other than the genjutsu on naruto. The same happened with kisame and gai. But u can't say that gai was weak.",

U can see her true purpose and importance in the war arc where it was needed the most, and it wasn't about fighting.\n\nEven despite it Ino's fighting skills with her strategies aren't something to be underestimated either. maybe not at hidan and kakuzu's arc but later on.",

And if you don't win against him then I can pretty much tell you the same thing you said about naruto. Because that's the same case with  sage naruto vs rinnegan madara. The difference in power is too huge.

Even though he was not stronger he was still a legend, a genius, the only person in the series who could use sharingan to that extent being a non uchiha.

Even if he has no info about the opponent he can still find his weakness in middle of a battle and make a plan to defeat him on the spot. Even if he never got his sharingan he would have been a legend. Sharingan is a double edged sword for a non uchiha. And Kakashi after war arc is the strongest version of Kakashi who has abundant Chakra and knows over 1000 jutsus. There are hardly and characters like Kakashi who even used his mangekyo with his own free will and Chakra. And in the war we have seen him outsmart someone like obito many times who was stronger than itachi. \n\n>Itachi soloed kakashi, Naruto, Sakura and the old lady with 1/5th of his power and almost won.\n\nI know itachi is strong but I didn't see him completely dominating all three with his 1/5 th power.

Moreover her presence only had advantage as the spy and medic for the team, because she never became a hindrance/burden for her team in the canon fight.\n\nShe's a Yamanaka (a clan where members are not meant to fight in frontlines) AND a medical ninja (who are not supposed to fight in frontlines.) U can see her true purpose and importance in the war arc where it was needed the most, and it wasn't about fighting.\n\nEven despite it Ino's fighting skills with her strategies aren't something to be underestimated either. maybe not at hidan and kakuzu's arc but later on.",

Even though he was not stronger he was still a legend, a genius, the only person in the series who could use sharingan to that extent being a non uchiha.

Even if he has no info about the opponent he can still find his weakness in middle of a battle and make a plan to defeat him on the spot. Even if he never got his sharingan he would have been a legend. Sharingan is a double edged sword for a non uchiha. And Kakashi after war arc is the strongest version of Kakashi who has abundant Chakra and knows over 1000 jutsus. There are hardly and characters like Kakashi who even used his mangekyo with his own free will and Chakra. And in the war we have seen him outsmart someone like obito many times who was stronger than itachi. \n\n>Itachi soloed kakashi, Naruto, Sakura and the old lady with 1/5th of his power and almost won.\n\nI know itachi is strong but I didn't see him completely dominating all three with his 1/5 th power. They were just alert. They didn't want to let their guard down. I didn't see him doing any noticeable damage other than the genjutsu on naruto. The same happened with kisame and gai.

U can see her true purpose and importance in the war arc where it was needed the most, and it wasn't about fighting.\n\nEven despite it Ino's fighting skills with her strategies aren't something to be underestimated either. maybe not at hidan and kakuzu's arc but later on.",

Even if he has no info about the opponent he can still find his weakness in middle of a battle and make a plan to defeat him on the spot. Even if he never got his sharingan he would have been a legend. Sharingan is a double edged sword for a non uchiha. And Kakashi after war arc is the strongest version of Kakashi who has abundant Chakra and knows over 1000 jutsus. There are hardly and characters like Kakashi who even used his mangekyo with his own free will and Chakra. And in the war we have seen him outsmart someone like obito many times who was stronger than itachi. \n\n>Itachi soloed kakashi, Naruto, Sakura and the old lady with 1/5th of his power and almost won.\n\nI know itachi is strong but I didn't see him completely dominating all three with his 1/5 th power. They were just alert. They didn't want to let their guard down. I didn't see him doing any noticeable damage other than the genjutsu on naruto. The same happened with kisame and gai.
