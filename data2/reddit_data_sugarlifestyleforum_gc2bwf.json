    "body": "Sometimes I feel like he\u2019s more of a dad than a bf. \n\nwe are 6 weeks in on lockdown and I haven\u2019t seen my SD/BF of 3 years since but he makes an effort to continue to spoil me.\n\nEvery 1-2 weeks he would send his chauffeur over to buy and deliver essentials: fresh fruits and veggies, happy food (chips, sweets). He would also include masks , vitamin c, gloves, whatever I need. he is also very careful to sanitize/clean all the fresh produce before giving them to me. \n\nWhere we are at, mobility is very limited. there are police checkpoints on the way to my place. \n\nHis love language is giving and no pandemic is gonna stop him from expressing that, even if it is affecting his business.\n\nIs this a common thing? Do SDs do this? \n\n\nI think he likes me a lot.",

He\u2019s going out of his way to not only check on you and make sure that you have everything that you need. But more importantly he\u2019s going out of his way to show you how much he cares.\n\nDo *not* take it for granted. Make sure you\u2019re showing him the same love and appreciation in return. Not in a tit for tat way obviously but just in your relationship.\n\nAnd don\u2019t feel badly, I\u2019m sure it makes him feel good to do these things for you. Especially now more than ever it probably makes him feel a bit helpless to not be able to care for you or help you in person.",
