    "body": "I brought my Wii over to the W Hollywood.  I've known this SB almost a year, and she is still one of those optimistic \"mom said I can do anything\" types.  So I figured it was time to show her the truth. We live in a dystopian reality where there is only me, and inferior Mario Kart players.  It's a harsh lesson, but one that all people must learn sooner or later.  Just before the first race starts, I get up to chug the rest of my pear mojito, and then settle in to crush some electronic dreams.\n#\nThat's when I sat on my own testicle.\n#\nI kind of consider myself an expert in sitting down.  Even more so, I am a scrawny dude.  I don't even have an ass; its like a long back that just turns into some legs at some point back there.  Chairs are basically something I ride cowgirl style, so it should be mathematically impossible for me to injure myself.... but I did.  The pain was immeasurable, even in metric.  I prayed for sweet, sweet death to end my misery.\n#\nNow you guys know that I am into some kinky stuff.  But let me tell you, the weirdest sugar date ever, is hands down, a grown, old ass man sobbing loudly while almost lapping a girl on peach beach.  As a result of the fact that I was the victim of a testicular homicide, I am humiliated to say that I won only 4 out of 5 cups.\n#\nAfter that, I was able to power through sex like an absolute HERO.  I was such a champion, that they even did that thing where they throw gatorade on your head, like that super ball game that gets you guys all hot and bothered. It wasn't gatorade though, it was wine.  And it wasn't other people throwing it on me, it was me splashing wine on myself. And it was mainly because I tripped over my bag on the way to the shower. But other than that, it was exactly like a championship sports ball.\n#\nAs soon as I was out of the shower, my SB starts throwing wild, unsubstantiated accusations all over the place.  Including:\n#\nA.  It's unfair to use funky kong and baby Luigi, since they are faster than everyone else.\n#\nB. It's rude to push girls into penguins.  (Technically that's why I am not allowed within 500 feet of zoos, but if security can't get me to stop, it's only fair that a hot chick shouldn't be able to either.)\n#\nC. It's cheating to use a sweaty boost at the start of a race.  (Yeah, like LA driver's don't hold down the accelerator before the light turns green as part of normal operating procedure).\n#\nD. And worst of all - She accused me of FAKING my injury, to justify the fact that I didn't win every time.  Come on! A man can't fake being murdered from the waist down. Besides, if I was going to fake an injury to excuse my poor performance, it would have been the 30 or so times we had sex, not Mario Kart.  Hell, if that works, imma start telling girls my dick is normally bigger, when I don't have a stubbed toe.\n#\nIf you guys need me, I am going to be sitting on ice.",
