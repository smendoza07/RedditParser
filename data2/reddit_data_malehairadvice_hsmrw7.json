They recommend microdosing for the most part. In a nutshell, Finasteride remaining in your tissue (hair follicles/scalp) is  far more important than Finasteride in your blood stream. In your blood stream Finasteride dissipates quickly, but in your tissue it remains for about 30 days. That's why they recommend 1mg 3x a week for non aggressive balders. Tissue vs Bloodstream is the key here, and this is why research on how much one should take varies.",
