    "body": "\u201cSBs who aren\u2019t attracted to their SDs should just go be escorts, because a sugar relationship is supposed to be like a real relationship and you can make more money escorting.\u201d I\u2019ve seen this sentiment multiple times on this board and it\u2019s willfully ignorant. Not everything is about money. Escorts regularly have sex with random dudes they don\u2019t know, an activity that runs an extremely high risk of being raped/murdered/abused/catching STDs. The advantage of a sugar relationship is that you know and trust the person you are sleeping with. Not everyone wants to put their life on the line. \n\nExpecting all SBs to be genuinely attracted to their SDs is insanely unrealistic, and no, it\u2019s not at all \u201clike a real relationship\u201d for many people. Many people, both SDs and SBs, are looking for NSA relationships, and it\u2019s not your place to say those \u201caren\u2019t real sugar relationships.\u201d",

                    "body": "This. OP clearly doesn\u2019t understand the difference between an escort and a prostitute. There are escorts with multiple regulars and they can limit their intimacy strictly to that set of regulars, if they choose. Having intimacy with multiple strange men is not the norm for a lot of them. The \u201cmany people\u201d you speak of, fit that bill.\n\nThere\u2019s a girl on YouTube who calls herself an SB but she\u2019s an escort with regulars (she says SB for views). If you look on her website, the veil gets lifted as she advertises as an escort. She only takes new clients when she chooses and also has a close relationship with one of the guys and he calls her his SGF.\n\nSo while you\u2019re making this post for them to stop saying that, there\u2019s a reason they are. The bottom line is, there\u2019s very little reason for an SD to stay with you if there isn\u2019t a genuine attraction and solid relationship. There\u2019s far too many other options out there for them.",

Many SW practice regular safer sex and get tested regularly, so they are as safe, if not more, as any monogamous SB.

I think that's fair.\n\nDo I expect and require my SB and I to have mutual attraction and chemistry and interest? Yes.\n\nI've found its rarely \"about the money\". I have had great early starts to an SR, provided agreed upon allowance or PPM and the SB \"loses interest.\" It's not even a rinsing. I am not even mad about it. But the money wasn't enough to keep her \"interested or attracted to me\". On the flip side some women (and yes SB caliber) can't stop messaging me, wanting to find ways to hang out, etc. and don't require money.\n\nIf the attraction and mutual interest isn't there, then I am not interested and there is no SR. That's a page from my book.\n\nWith that being said, I agree with you. Nobody should escort-shame the way you described. Its often a tactic to try to manipulate a SB and not pay agreed on PPM/allowance. But many SBs treat the game as an escort-type situation. Moving from guy to guy, collecting PPM, and having no interest of finding a sustainable SR with an SD - and then they decry escorts. That's their business.\n\nAlso, plenty of men and women have sex with strangers in vanilla dating and practice the same \"dangerous\" lifestyle you describe.\n\nSet your own filters. If \"escorts shaming\" is a deal breaker, its a deal breaker. Move on. If attraction isn't a criteria you care about, that is ok. But, if you are not attracted to me, its a deal breaker for me.\n\nTL:DR - There are all sorts of antics in the bowl. The great intersection of money and sex. While the bowl has \"no rules\" and you can make it what you want, there are some best practices guidelines that increase odds of success.",

Mutual respect is there. Than again im a real sd. Giving a young girl a rich male ally and tutor does wonders for them. You build that trust. You don't be controlling and enjoy them for them and not only the sex. The reward is they truly appreciate you and will fight to keep you in their lives until real world hits fantasy world. I vet hard and I've found 3 great sb relationships over the years. And they are extremely different as the girls stopped using seeking normally looking for 1 guy or 2 they can trust and like. Escorts will fuck anyone that passes the screening process. Sex is impersonal and connection 0. Please escorts stop comparing the 2. Not even on the same level.",

The \u201cmany people\u201d you speak of, fit that bill.\n\nThere\u2019s a girl on YouTube who calls herself an SB but she\u2019s an escort with regulars (she says SB for views). If you look on her website, the veil gets lifted as she advertises as an escort. She only takes new clients when she chooses and also has a close relationship with one of the guys and he calls her his SGF.\n\nSo while you\u2019re making this post for them to stop saying that, there\u2019s a reason they are. The bottom line is, there\u2019s very little reason for an SD to stay with you if there isn\u2019t a genuine attraction and solid relationship.

Many SW practice regular safer sex and get tested regularly, so they are as safe, if not more, as any monogamous SB. Then there are other types of SW-like OF, web camming, stripping, and pro-Domme work that is much safer than sugaring-because there is less intimate sexual interaction. \n\nTristan Terimino has an excellent podcast called Sex Out Loud.

As I mentioned, it's the criminalization that makes SW more dangerous than anything else. \n\nTherefore, the type of SW will determine the exposure. Street workers are inherently more exposed than indoor workers. Higher end escorts are less exposed than lower end-and even many sugar workers. Many SW practice regular safer sex and get tested regularly, so they are as safe, if not more, as any monogamous SB. Then there are other types of SW-like OF, web camming, stripping, and pro-Domme work that is much safer than sugaring-because there is less intimate sexual interaction. \n\nTristan Terimino has an excellent podcast called Sex Out Loud. She's a leader in the sex positive movement.

As I mentioned, it's the criminalization that makes SW more dangerous than anything else. \n\nTherefore, the type of SW will determine the exposure. Street workers are inherently more exposed than indoor workers. Higher end escorts are less exposed than lower end-and even many sugar workers. Many SW practice regular safer sex and get tested regularly, so they are as safe, if not more, as any monogamous SB. Then there are other types of SW-like OF, web camming, stripping, and pro-Domme work that is much safer than sugaring-because there is less intimate sexual interaction. \n\nTristan Terimino has an excellent podcast called Sex Out Loud. She's a leader in the sex positive movement. I just finished listening to episode 96, where she had two long time scholars on SW rights were speaking to this very subject.\n https://sexoutloud.libsyn.com/scientists-for-sex-worker-rights-with-barb-and-ron",

As I mentioned, it's the criminalization that makes SW more dangerous than anything else. \n\nTherefore, the type of SW will determine the exposure. Street workers are inherently more exposed than indoor workers. Higher end escorts are less exposed than lower end-and even many sugar workers. Many SW practice regular safer sex and get tested regularly, so they are as safe, if not more, as any monogamous SB. Then there are other types of SW-like OF, web camming, stripping, and pro-Domme work that is much safer than sugaring-because there is less intimate sexual interaction. \n\nTristan Terimino has an excellent podcast called Sex Out Loud. She's a leader in the sex positive movement. I just finished listening to episode 96, where she had two long time scholars on SW rights were speaking to this very subject.\n https://sexoutloud.libsyn.com/scientists-for-sex-worker-rights-with-barb-and-ron",
