    "body": "Was reached out today with this message. Let me know your thoughts, was too good to not share:\n\nHey lovely, I\u2019m curious let\u2019s see if you can get me interested with your charm:) \n\nI do want you to understand why I don\u2019t share any photos. I served over 20 years in the military, have multiple reputable businesses and speak publicly. Then there\u2019s the transgender scam with photoshop. So, I won\u2019t put anything out there on the web. \n\nAs far as my looks, I\u2019ve heard if \u201cThe Rock\u201d looked a little better he\u2019d look like me. \ud83d\ude42\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a writer, life coach, fitness trainer, real estate trainer, trainer of business people and mentors clients that want the keys to winning bigger; I hope you are intuitive enough to see why I repel narcissistic women and why I\u2019ve been lucky enough to attract only the most beautiful and intelligent women on here and why you should at least give it a try. \n\nI\u2019m only on here for brief periods just to screen out a few women that don\u2019t believe women on here would go for what I share when truthfully it seems like I only attract the sweetest, smartest, most sensual, and beautiful women on the site. \n\nSo, I do have to repel a few rude women that think only ppm women are on here and there are no women that want a true mentor that can help them live their best life now. \n\nI know with so many messages coming in there are a lot of women that want something real with no strings attached. A true friend with benefits. You deserve that \n\nI\u2019m lucky there are lovely young ladies on here like you that understand ppm is not allowed and I only choose the cream of the crop that love to be treated like a queen and want to experience the kind of pleasure that makes you lose track of time. \n\nI see real potential and if you do as well, I can be a real friend with lifetime benefits for the young lady that deserve more. I hope it\u2019s you. \n\nI know some women are over experienced and they seemed to be upset that curious young ladies are on here just finding a great male role model. But I\u2019m good with that. \n\nIf you are that young beautiful women that knows that you joined the site for something exciting and new, for ways to be pleased that you may not even know exist, then you found the perfect fit. \n\nIt\u2019s seriously NO PPM for me the site prohibits it and I follow the rules to the letter. \n\nI only want the beautiful young woman that want to be treated like a queen that admires her king and gets to enjoy shopping and fine dining because you are grateful for every gift you receive. \n\nSomething tells me you are that young beautiful woman that wants to just explore things, everything, together discreetly with an older guy that makes you comfortable enough to moan immediately with no strings attached. \n\nSomeone you can learn things you didn\u2019t know you wanted until you felt them. \n\nYou are tired of the young or desperate guys that think you have to be in love to want to be explored thoroughly but I've learned that beautiful women like you are left out of the Vegas type moments because guys are intoxicated by your looks and have these vision of marrying you before knowing how to please you. \n\nI know it\u2019s emotional, spiritual, mental, and physical. Ways to become your best self and never be bored again but in a pleasurable way most women don\u2019t experience until there 50. You don\u2019t have to wait any longer. \n\nIf you\u2019re the 1 in a thousand that deserves what you desire and you\u2019re the kind of young lady that follows through on spontaneity and loves immediate thrills then leave your best number to call. \n\nI know you love being explored more than anything with a clean cut handsome man that allows you to be your naughtiest discreetly. \n\nIf that\u2019s really you and you want to experience the best days of your life and learn this new sensation that make you feel intoxicated with so much\ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udca6 you never want it to end while you learn the secrets to your best life ever. \n\nEven if you\u2019re the slight bit curious with what you read but know you would love this, leave your number and I will send you the TEXT MESSAGE that makes life changing sensations seem possible with the young lady that\u2019s already in a good place and wants better. \n\nI think it could be you, so Leave your number and let\u2019s see if you can get me from curious to interested. If that\u2019s ok.\n\nMy response: Lmao if you can\u2019t afford a Sugar Baby then all you had to do was say so \ud83d\ude02 It\u2019s funny how you\u2019re so open to talk about intimacy but can\u2019t talk about financials KNOWING that\u2019s what this is. You talk about financials in text. This is bs \ud83d\ude02\n\nHis response which I find hilarious: \nI might listen if I was broke like you and had to sell myself for money. But I don\u2019t want a cheap $xxx (low amount) whore. \n\nThe women I date on here want to go places do stuff together. Like trips to Cancun. Cabo. Cozumel. LA Vegas. \n\nThey don\u2019t give it up to every guy with a dollar. \n\nSorry honey my profile is written this way for a reason. It weeds out the trash. And from reading your comment it\u2019s doing a great job. \n\nNothing better than trash that takes itself out. \n\nGood luck. You\u2019ll be fine l. There are plenty of men with no standards that want you. Bye\n\nI think I hurt his little ego lol",
