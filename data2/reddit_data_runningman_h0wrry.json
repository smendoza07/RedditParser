            "body": "Although Running Man will always be my favourite variety program, KB is actually pretty good. Hodong has softened here and the episode featuring Somin (ep28) is one of the greats especially the skits. In fact this was actually filmed before she joined RM so this speaks volumes on her variety skills.\n\nI feel like KB is a better show for promoting idols tho. The humor in Running Man requires higher comedic ability (KB guests may not excel at RM, but those who are funny at RM are funny at KB too) and is something Somin is gifted at.",

                            "body": "Yeah basically this. KB is probably preferable for celebs to go on to promote than RM. Unless you're big enough and RM creates a themed mission/episode for you (eh Jung Woo Sung and the 100 CCTVs was epic). \n\nKB is talk show format, getting to know guests with questions, even have time to do proper dance/sing. So yeah it is an easy choice for celebs promoting dramas, movies and idols promoting songs. There is pretty much guaranteed screen time and promo time. The cast is also very varied and well connected so if all else fails just tell a story about the cast or exploit Ho Dong haha. \n\nHowever I think RM is a better show to launch variety careers/images, trend or show a different/humourous side esp for actors/actresses. Like who knew the variety gems behind Lee Da Hee, Lee Sang Yeob, Kang Han Na, Lee Do Hyun etc. While they can be funny on KB it doesn't show them in the full variety hijinks mixing with funny situations, game playing and betrayal and different personalities of the cast.",

Running Man kinda still represents the old style of reality shows like 1N2D and FO where it's really a big gamble on screentime. 2nd wave kpop groups like SNSD and Big Bang definitely excelled and were trained for them but the newer generation seems more suited for livestreams/social media and talk show promotion.",

There are pre interview qns, a standard format to interact with the members. Naturally she can protray her thoughts and light jokes from past episodes/ relationships can build from there. Its such a big difference to RM where they mostly listen to the rules,play the games. The general funny moments only happen when there are reactions, a witty answer to a casual qn, comedic dance highlights, body gags etc.",

Unless you're big enough and RM creates a themed mission/episode for you (eh Jung Woo Sung and the 100 CCTVs was epic). \n\nKB is talk show format, getting to know guests with questions, even have time to do proper dance/sing. So yeah it is an easy choice for celebs promoting dramas, movies and idols promoting songs. There is pretty much guaranteed screen time and promo time. The cast is also very varied and well connected so if all else fails just tell a story about the cast or exploit Ho Dong haha. \n\nHowever I think RM is a better show to launch variety careers/images, trend or show a different/humourous side esp for actors/actresses. Like who knew the variety gems behind Lee Da Hee, Lee Sang Yeob, Kang Han Na, Lee Do Hyun etc. While they can be funny on KB it doesn't show them in the full variety hijinks mixing with funny situations, game playing and betrayal and different personalities of the cast.",

Unless you're big enough and RM creates a themed mission/episode for you (eh Jung Woo Sung and the 100 CCTVs was epic). \n\nKB is talk show format, getting to know guests with questions, even have time to do proper dance/sing. So yeah it is an easy choice for celebs promoting dramas, movies and idols promoting songs. There is pretty much guaranteed screen time and promo time. The cast is also very varied and well connected so if all else fails just tell a story about the cast or exploit Ho Dong haha. \n\nHowever I think RM is a better show to launch variety careers/images, trend or show a different/humourous side esp for actors/actresses. Like who knew the variety gems behind Lee Da Hee, Lee Sang Yeob, Kang Han Na, Lee Do Hyun etc. While they can be funny on KB it doesn't show them in the full variety hijinks mixing with funny situations, game playing and betrayal and different personalities of the cast.",
