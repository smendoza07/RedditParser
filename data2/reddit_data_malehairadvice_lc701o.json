I've been refining my hair routine. Its essentially this: \n\nCold water wash (no shampoo or conditioner) on Thursday. \n\nCold water wash with conditioner on Sunday (no shampoo). And use American Crew Forming Creme while it's still damp and crunch hair. The following days, don't wash with water or anything. For the most part, it holds up real nice until I wash it out on Thursday. \n\nI also pat dry my hair and almost always let it air dry. Hair dryers tend to promote the mess you see with this picture lmao",

I've been refining my hair routine. Its essentially this: \n\nCold water wash (no shampoo or conditioner) on Thursday. \n\nCold water wash with conditioner on Sunday (no shampoo). And use American Crew Forming Creme while it's still damp and crunch hair. The following days, don't wash with water or anything. For the most part, it holds up real nice until I wash it out on Thursday. \n\nI also pat dry my hair and almost always let it air dry. Hair dryers tend to promote the mess you see with this picture lmao",
