(Think when giving a speech. If the guy is playing with his fingers and constantly moving them it makes him look nervous. You never want to look nervous). So many people do this, and typically the super nervous guys who refuse to talk to girls or talk to new people in general (maybe introverted? I really don't know these people well enough) are the people I see doing this the most.\n\nJust my two scents. Other that that, you look really good! Now it's all behavior brother\n\nEdit: i said something ",
