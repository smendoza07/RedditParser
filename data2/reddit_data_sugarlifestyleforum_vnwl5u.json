    "body": "Some SDs believe that if they spoil too much their SB, they might leave once they get what they want. WRONG! Spoiling is a way of showing that you value your SB and you appreciate her. Devaluing her is the quickest way to lose her and she will definitely replace you to someone better. Women are easy. Treat us right and we will treat you better.\nI really hate this kind of mindset of an SD! Like sir, you are missing out.\n\nEdit 1: some \u201cSDs\u201d got butthurt. Peace y\u2019all\n\nEdit 2: Spoiling does NOT necessarily mean luxury!!! Spoiling can be done through wisdom, knowledge, replying fast, your time and yes it can be paying for nails or a little gift that reminds of your SB. Stop talking with your stingy a**",

Or my dream date a vanilla milkshake and a bookstore!I would lose my mind lol. I think you should know your value of what you want and need but there's a difference between that and just draining somebody. There's joy in giving as well. So I will try to do little things as acts of giving..it makes me feel good and honestly it makes your partner feel good and in the end both end up putting in more. And if he doesn't ...well then you don't have to stay; but you can walk away knowing you were damn good to him and for him and he'll know it to.he can't say you were just using him. There's no give without take its a full circle. Know your worth to not accept less and walk away when needed.  but be so fierce that you can give in world of take.",

There is an inflection point, which differs for every SB, where giving any more increases her sense of entitlement and emboldens an anything goes attitude where she feels she has too much power, and giving less causes her to look elsewhere for a new relationship.\n\nRichard Kipling's IF poem, a particular favorite of mine, seems particularly apt for how to think about this. Maybe he just forgot the last few lines, which probably went something like this:\n\nIF you can help your SB with her car payment on top of her allowance, and not have her feel emboldened to ask for a new car for her best friend.\nIF you can pay for your SB's child's emergency appendectomy, but she not ask for a boob job for all her friends.\nIF you can assist your SB with airfare to see her dying mother, and avoid taking advantage of her by requesting a BJ on the way to the airport.\nIF you can help your SB with her must haves, but avoid being a POS SIMP.\nThen yours is the earth my friend and the SR will last longer than your last one, or until she gets sick of you old hairy ass.\nTHE END",

If you feel like the allowance doesn't suffice for the gap in vanilla compatibility, then you've done a poor job at selecting him.\n\nIf you are expecting someone to provide you with extras such as a new car, then the question really is to ask yourself if you are making similar gestures. Are you going on overnights without expecting anything? Are you making extra time for him? Are you doing thoughtful gestures like cooking or baking randomly?\n\nThere are many ways to express yourself and to put in extra effort into being a good sugar partner without expecting sex or money in return. That is what we mean by it. If you are the type to only motivate yourself to make an effort when the allowance is at play, then you are unlikely to be the type someone wants to spoil above and beyond. \n\nTake that coming from someone who provides an allowance 4-5 times the area average and who provides experiences with vacations and high cost dates all the time. If you specifically want something outside the agreement that is enjoyable only to you personally, you need to make effort to do things that the other person finds enjoyable.",

SDs can spend their money on multiple women, SBs can earn extra money having multiple SDs\n\nIt's heavily frowned upon if SBs have multiple SDs and we're considered \"pros\" if we do that. It's more easier to find ANY woman to be an SB and give sex and feigned attention than it is to find an SD who is financially capable of having an arrangement. \n\nWith respect, I can't blame SOME sbs for not providing certain things to SDs because sometimes, the PPM doesn't reflect it the requests that's being asked. This just happened to me yesterday, a POT SD who is married only wanted an oral sex arrangement. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, right? For 300 tacos, he wanted MONOGAMY as in  for me to not go on dates with other as well as no sex and he wasn't going to sexually satisfy me. Because I'm not a dirt bag, I couldn't promise him that and rather not put someone's health in jeopardy, but it wasn't enough for me to be monogamous to someone AND me not being sexually satisfied. \n\nIt's great that the men on Reddit are able to provide great allowances and if my monthly allowance was in the 2XXX range, best believe you wouldn't have to tell me twice or wait for me to suggest something. But in the real world, there's a lot of mediocre monthly allowances and outlandish demands on SDs expectations which is why some SDs have trouble finding SBs.",

However it\u2019s not like a sugar relationship is a marriage where everything must be disclosed. If I was a SB, I\u2019d have multiple SDs and just not tell them. \n\nAs for the rest, we seem to agree that it needs to be fair for the SB and the SD. 3XX isn\u2019t a fair agreement for an oral sex arrangement with monogamy.

We move back to PPM with the resolve to this time observe the reward system in return for good behavior only.\n\nThen we wait for the boyfriend to leave because we crave the affection you never gave us. Finally, we lose interest and move on, with or without telling you. \n\nSpooling doesn't work unless it's a reward for understanding our needs and attending to it.

I do expect more than the bare minimum of spoiling",

Then he gets mad at me for being cranky, complaining and saying that I don\u2019t feel well because of my low blood sugar. Claims I\u2019m ruining his daughter\u2019s trip and sends me away to get back home on my own 200 miles away. He literally said when we talked on the phone later that he\u2019s \u201cnot responsible for my blood sugar.\u201d A sugar daddy that won\u2019t even provide for basic needs while on vacation with him and puts my safety at risk by making me go home on my own is no sugar daddy at all. Talk about being devalued. That incident was very traumatic and I don\u2019t travel to or with SDs anymore. I was suicidal during and after this happened. The SDs here are complaining about feeling \u201ctaken for granted\u201d well I\u2019m sorry but that is nothing compared to something like this.

But if you actually go through the relationships in your whole extended friend group what you\u2019ll find is that literally every kind of strength is thoroughly rewarded.\n\nNice guys do really well.  I don\u2019t mean \u201cnice guys\u201d - Which means guys who dont know how to ever be assertive, and who women burden in subtle ways.\n\nAs far as the dominance relation between the man and woman, not letting her push you around is pretty much all you have to do.  That said, there are so many super hot women who marry guys and push them around or have a strong tendency to date guys they can push around.",

If you feel like the allowance doesn't suffice for the gap in vanilla compatibility, then you've done a poor job at selecting him.\n\nIf you are expecting someone to provide you with extras such as a new car, then the question really is to ask yourself if you are making similar gestures. Are you going on overnights without expecting anything? Are you making extra time for him? Are you doing thoughtful gestures like cooking or baking randomly?\n\nThere are many ways to express yourself and to put in extra effort into being a good sugar partner without expecting sex or money in return. That is what we mean by it. If you are the type to only motivate yourself to make an effort when the allowance is at play, then you are unlikely to be the type someone wants to spoil above and beyond. \n\nTake that coming from someone who provides an allowance 4-5 times the area average and who provides experiences with vacations and high cost dates all the time. If you specifically want something outside the agreement that is enjoyable only to you personally, you need to make effort to do things that the other person finds enjoyable.",

SDs can spend their money on multiple women, SBs can earn extra money having multiple SDs\n\nIt's heavily frowned upon if SBs have multiple SDs and we're considered \"pros\" if we do that. It's more easier to find ANY woman to be an SB and give sex and feigned attention than it is to find an SD who is financially capable of having an arrangement. \n\nWith respect, I can't blame SOME sbs for not providing certain things to SDs because sometimes, the PPM doesn't reflect it the requests that's being asked. This just happened to me yesterday, a POT SD who is married only wanted an oral sex arrangement. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, right? For 300 tacos, he wanted MONOGAMY as in  for me to not go on dates with other as well as no sex and he wasn't going to sexually satisfy me. Because I'm not a dirt bag, I couldn't promise him that and rather not put someone's health in jeopardy, but it wasn't enough for me to be monogamous to someone AND me not being sexually satisfied. \n\nIt's great that the men on Reddit are able to provide great allowances and if my monthly allowance was in the 2XXX range, best believe you wouldn't have to tell me twice or wait for me to suggest something. But in the real world, there's a lot of mediocre monthly allowances and outlandish demands on SDs expectations which is why some SDs have trouble finding SBs.",

If you are an SD taking your SB on vacation, you are responsible for her basic physiological needs such as food and water, and for her safety. You can\u2019t just suddenly decide you don\u2019t want to provide for those needs and force her to figure out a way home on her own. That is what happened to me and it\u2019s unacceptable.

SDs can spend their money on multiple women, SBs can earn extra money having multiple SDs\n\nIt's heavily frowned upon if SBs have multiple SDs and we're considered \"pros\" if we do that. It's more easier to find ANY woman to be an SB and give sex and feigned attention than it is to find an SD who is financially capable of having an arrangement. \n\nWith respect, I can't blame SOME sbs for not providing certain things to SDs because sometimes, the PPM doesn't reflect it the requests that's being asked. This just happened to me yesterday, a POT SD who is married only wanted an oral sex arrangement. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, right? For 300 tacos, he wanted MONOGAMY as in  for me to not go on dates with other as well as no sex and he wasn't going to sexually satisfy me. Because I'm not a dirt bag, I couldn't promise him that and rather not put someone's health in jeopardy, but it wasn't enough for me to be monogamous to someone AND me not being sexually satisfied. \n\nIt's great that the men on Reddit are able to provide great allowances and if my monthly allowance was in the 2XXX range, best believe you wouldn't have to tell me twice or wait for me to suggest something. But in the real world, there's a lot of mediocre monthly allowances and outlandish demands on SDs expectations which is why some SDs have trouble finding SBs.",

If you are an SD taking your SB on vacation, you are responsible for her basic physiological needs such as food and water, and for her safety. You can\u2019t just suddenly decide you don\u2019t want to provide for those needs and force her to figure out a way home on her own. That is what happened to me and it\u2019s unacceptable.

SDs can spend their money on multiple women, SBs can earn extra money having multiple SDs\n\nIt's heavily frowned upon if SBs have multiple SDs and we're considered \"pros\" if we do that. It's more easier to find ANY woman to be an SB and give sex and feigned attention than it is to find an SD who is financially capable of having an arrangement. \n\nWith respect, I can't blame SOME sbs for not providing certain things to SDs because sometimes, the PPM doesn't reflect it the requests that's being asked. This just happened to me yesterday, a POT SD who is married only wanted an oral sex arrangement. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, right? For 300 tacos, he wanted MONOGAMY as in  for me to not go on dates with other as well as no sex and he wasn't going to sexually satisfy me. Because I'm not a dirt bag, I couldn't promise him that and rather not put someone's health in jeopardy, but it wasn't enough for me to be monogamous to someone AND me not being sexually satisfied. \n\nIt's great that the men on Reddit are able to provide great allowances and if my monthly allowance was in the 2XXX range, best believe you wouldn't have to tell me twice or wait for me to suggest something. But in the real world, there's a lot of mediocre monthly allowances and outlandish demands on SDs expectations which is why some SDs have trouble finding SBs.",

If you are an SD taking your SB on vacation, you are responsible for her basic physiological needs such as food and water, and for her safety. You can\u2019t just suddenly decide you don\u2019t want to provide for those needs and force her to figure out a way home on her own. That is what happened to me and it\u2019s unacceptable.

It's more easier to find ANY woman to be an SB and give sex and feigned attention than it is to find an SD who is financially capable of having an arrangement. \n\nWith respect, I can't blame SOME sbs for not providing certain things to SDs because sometimes, the PPM doesn't reflect it the requests that's being asked. This just happened to me yesterday, a POT SD who is married only wanted an oral sex arrangement. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, right? For 300 tacos, he wanted MONOGAMY as in  for me to not go on dates with other as well as no sex and he wasn't going to sexually satisfy me. Because I'm not a dirt bag, I couldn't promise him that and rather not put someone's health in jeopardy, but it wasn't enough for me to be monogamous to someone AND me not being sexually satisfied. \n\nIt's great that the men on Reddit are able to provide great allowances and if my monthly allowance was in the 2XXX range, best believe you wouldn't have to tell me twice or wait for me to suggest something. But in the real world, there's a lot of mediocre monthly allowances and outlandish demands on SDs expectations which is why some SDs have trouble finding SBs.",

It's more easier to find ANY woman to be an SB and give sex and feigned attention than it is to find an SD who is financially capable of having an arrangement. \n\nWith respect, I can't blame SOME sbs for not providing certain things to SDs because sometimes, the PPM doesn't reflect it the requests that's being asked. This just happened to me yesterday, a POT SD who is married only wanted an oral sex arrangement. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, right? For 300 tacos, he wanted MONOGAMY as in  for me to not go on dates with other as well as no sex and he wasn't going to sexually satisfy me. Because I'm not a dirt bag, I couldn't promise him that and rather not put someone's health in jeopardy, but it wasn't enough for me to be monogamous to someone AND me not being sexually satisfied. \n\nIt's great that the men on Reddit are able to provide great allowances and if my monthly allowance was in the 2XXX range, best believe you wouldn't have to tell me twice or wait for me to suggest something. But in the real world, there's a lot of mediocre monthly allowances and outlandish demands on SDs expectations which is why some SDs have trouble finding SBs.",

I think the turbulence trait makes us resonate with each other much more. \n\nThe current guy is INFJ-A .. his assertive vibe gives me he\u2019s more like INTJ sometimes but later I got him to do the test and came out as INFJ.. also he\u2019s very expressive so I believe he\u2019s more feeler than thinker. \n\nWhat are you? I think you might be an INFP male? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude42",
