I don't know if I'll ever be able to stop completely but I've been pulling much less frequently lately. The important thing is staying away from the hairs on your head. Wearing a hat helped me for a while. Eventually I stopped having the urge to pull from there anymore. I think allowing myself to pluck body hair made it a lot easier to not pull my head hair. Ideally I wouldn't pull at all but you have to start somewhere.",
