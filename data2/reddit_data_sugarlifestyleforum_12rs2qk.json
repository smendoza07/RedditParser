We already know this.   You don\u2019t have to mention it, especially at the very beginning of your profile. \n- since you mentioned that you have a child, you might want to discuss your availability and ability to travel. \n\nGood luck in your search and be sure to remember the first rule in this lifestyle\u2026 BE CAREFUL!
