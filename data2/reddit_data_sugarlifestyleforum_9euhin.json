    "body": "Not kidding. My grandmother was a knock out when she was young. Still is at 75. She lived an amazing life. Became a model, had men throwing the best of everything at her to get her attention. She eventually met a wonderful man who hired her as his own personal model for his jewelry company. She would tell me the stories about the things he did for her. She worked hard, she was always on business trips. As I got older,  she revealed more intimate details of their relationship. The one thing I love most about her is the fact she is open minded. It didn't hit me until I was a little older that she was , in fact, a Sugar Baby. When I decided I wanted to do this , I asked her for confirmation about their relationship. She just smiled at me and said \"If you got it, go for it\". I met him once, very sweet man. Always made sure she had any thing she needed, plus extra..if it hadn't been for him, I wouldn't have had the experiences I did as a child. She was able to provide well for me because of his generosity.  They were inseparable and when he died, she was crushed. She had been with him for over 30 years. Met him in her 20's, he died when my grandmother was 54. So, needless to say her and I bond over that. I guess you can say it is in my blood. I think it's  awesome so just thought I'd share. ",
