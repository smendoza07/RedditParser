    "body": "I\u2019ve never asked for compensation to meet. I always see some SBs here saying they\u2019ll at least ask for associated travel costs, Uber, etc.\nI was once offered cash at a M&G which I declined because I knew I wouldn\u2019t see him again (and told him so). \n\nLast week I met with a very wealthy man. I was able to google him from some info he gave me so I was able to verify this. I drove over an hour to meet him. Prior to the meet I remembered some of the advice on here from SBs recommending trying to negotiate travel costs. I debated bringing it up but didn\u2019t because it\u2019s just not my style. \n\nWe met and had a lovely uncompensated meal. After it was over, and on my drive home, I doubted myself due to what I\u2019ve heard here because he didn\u2019t offer to reimburse travel after the meet was over. He said he wanted to move forward, but that was it. I told him we could discuss an arrangement after a good nights sleep. \n\nNow: I\u2019m positive some SBs here are rolling their eyes. But here\u2019s why this ended up working for me - and I\u2019m happy I ended up taking the opinions of some here with a grain of salt - and went with MY style. \n\nWe talked at length on the phone the next day. I already had a number in my mind on my ask based on travel. When we discussed logistics he said he thought he\u2019d travel to my city 50%, 25% to his city and the other 25% weekends away at his shore house. At this point, I\u2019m willing to accept less than my ask, because it would require less travel to him. \n\nThen he says he\u2019s thankful I didn\u2019t try to bleed him for the meet - he said he refuses to meet anyone who asks or demands for compensation up front. His thought: he\u2019d never pay to see goods he was planning on leasing, especially if he\u2019s already committing to the meal, etc. (paraphrasing, he wasn\u2019t as crass.) He said too many women have seen what he\u2019s worth and immediately asked for X to meet, or an Uber, a gift, or immediately start with the Amazon Wish list. \n\nSo we finally get around to talk of financials and I ask him what he\u2019s comfortable with. (I always do this, but am prepared to throw a number out if they refuse.) And his number is exactly my ask I had in mind for traveling to him 100% of the time. Now, my first thought is - SBs would want to negotiate higher or suggest doing so. Instead I tell him the number is perfectly acceptable. We both end the call pleased and we agree to meet (last night). (Collective eye roll for leaving money on the table.)\n\nSo - last night we go out for dinner and a show. At the beginning of the date he tells me he\u2019d like to hold off intimacy until it feels organic. As such he\u2019d like if we would just spend time together that night. I am happy to do so, since he seemed very genuine. We see a show I\u2019ve been dying to see, and at that point I\u2019d be willing to have the date unpaid. Instead, he hands me an envelope at the end of the date and kisses me goodbye. \n\nI look in the envelope when I get home and there\u2019s 25% more in there than we agreed on. I text him to say so - and his response is : I wanted to reimburse your travel and costs for the other day. (25% more covers way more than my travel expenses.)\n\nWe\u2019ve made plans to see each other again next week.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. Take what you see here on SLF into consideration. But don\u2019t let it change what you do if it\u2019s not who you are. If I\u2019d gone with my thought to change up my style, I never would\u2019ve met this man for our first meet. \n\nTL:DR - Be yourself. Do what feels natural. Don\u2019t get greedy. ",

I  don\u2018t  think  anything  you\u2018ve  stated  would  be  frowned  upon.\n\nExactly. In fact, the converse is generally frowned upon. It's like saying 'Unpopular Opinion: I brush my teeth every day' in a dentristry sub\n\nWe've had a million don't ask for M&G 'fees' threads. SD's/SB's alike will also say that a gentleman will reimburse your travel costs but it doesn't necessarily need to be mentioned unless you'll be out of a lot of money.\n\nAlso, it wasn't anything special that you did OP, you were just lucky. For every girl who doesn't mention travel costs but gets them reimburses a few days later, I'm sure there are many more that get ghosted leaving them out of gas money *and* a SD. \n\nCongrats, but the preachy tone of your post is kinda weird and misplaced.",

Even then there's never guarantee they're gonna show up or that they'll stick to their word. \n\n\nThe whole \"don't ask for travel cost or anything else for the m&g\" shouldn't be prescriptive on this sub imo. You don't know how far an SB has to travel to see a pot and you don't really know if the dent in gas or time and effort from travel could hurt her budget for the month or not. Maybe she's giving up a 3-4 hour babysitting gig or she has to drive 50-80 miles each way. It's why I think it's *more* important focus on getting the background from these girls before giving any kind of advice rather than focusing on what they should or shouldn't do to get an SD interested.\n\n\nThen you'd get an SB coming in who's afraid of asking for any kind of compensation for traveling 2 hours to meet a pot. It's not even a hyperbole these have been legit questions in the past.  \n\n\nAs an SB with a stable career I can afford to do whatever I want and risk losing $50-100 and a chunk of my day. Someone who is struggling with keeping a job or who lives off of a stipend can't afford to indulge. ",

            "body": "I'm glad this approach worked out for you but it's also important to maintain a balance because for every generous SD there are ten more who will take advantage of girls with this attitude. When I first entered the bowl I tried really hard to not come off as greedy and ended up getting screwed over a lot. Now I learned to ask for exactly what I want instead of taking \"don't worry babe I'll take good care of you\" as an answer or settling for less hoping to get a raise in allowance later (common scam is start off with low PPM with promises to move to a high monthly allowance). I've found that the guys who make big promises and make it seem like you don't need to worry about discussing the business side of things end up being the most stingy and they take advantage of young girls' apprehension with talking money or seeming greedy. \n\nI've found that genuine SDs are okay with dealing with the discomfort of talking money up front and dropping that illusion of \"she wants me for me not just my money\" while the salt daddies are the only ones who get truly offended by it. I never ask for paid M&G (besides travel) or anything I'm not entitled to but now I don't budge on requesting the allowance that would keep me happy (rather than just \"ok\" with it). Financially a couple hundred bucks difference isn't the end of the world, but psychologically selling yourself \"short\" can be damaging. ",

She arrived and claimed UBER couldn't arrive in time so she drove, just slow. Didn't want to ghost me. After lunch I walked her to car. She said sheepishly my tanks on \"E'. I felt embarrassed that I forgot to give her some token travel money and quickly gave her what I had  figured was 200% of what Uber costs and would easily fill her tank. A day later I get msg .. \"no chemistry\" which was a disappointment but OK. I just wonder if there had been chemistry, would the empty gas tank have been mentioned. \n\nAt the other end is a POT #2. Needs to fly in (1.25 hrs). I'm making all arrangements (see SNAFU next time rant/rave ha ha) for M&G to maybe move into arrangement. When asked about sugar for travel time, long distance M&G and possible starting an arrangement before next days flight back, response is \"I'll just go with the flow\".

Even then there's never guarantee they're gonna show up or that they'll stick to their word. \n\n\nThe whole \"don't ask for travel cost or anything else for the m&g\" shouldn't be prescriptive on this sub imo. You don't know how far an SB has to travel to see a pot and you don't really know if the dent in gas or time and effort from travel could hurt her budget for the month or not. Maybe she's giving up a 3-4 hour babysitting gig or she has to drive 50-80 miles each way. It's why I think it's *more* important focus on getting the background from these girls before giving any kind of advice rather than focusing on what they should or shouldn't do to get an SD interested.\n\n\nThen you'd get an SB coming in who's afraid of asking for any kind of compensation for traveling 2 hours to meet a pot. It's not even a hyperbole these have been legit questions in the past.  \n\n\nAs an SB with a stable career I can afford to do whatever I want and risk losing $50-100 and a chunk of my day. Someone who is struggling with keeping a job or who lives off of a stipend can't afford to indulge. ",

Even then there's never guarantee they're gonna show up or that they'll stick to their word. \n\n\nThe whole \"don't ask for travel cost or anything else for the m&g\" shouldn't be prescriptive on this sub imo. You don't know how far an SB has to travel to see a pot and you don't really know if the dent in gas or time and effort from travel could hurt her budget for the month or not. Maybe she's giving up a 3-4 hour babysitting gig or she has to drive 50-80 miles each way. It's why I think it's *more* important focus on getting the background from these girls before giving any kind of advice rather than focusing on what they should or shouldn't do to get an SD interested.\n\n\nThen you'd get an SB coming in who's afraid of asking for any kind of compensation for traveling 2 hours to meet a pot. It's not even a hyperbole these have been legit questions in the past.  \n\n\nAs an SB with a stable career I can afford to do whatever I want and risk losing $50-100 and a chunk of my day. Someone who is struggling with keeping a job or who lives off of a stipend can't afford to indulge. ",
