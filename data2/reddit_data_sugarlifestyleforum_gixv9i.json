    "body": "And this is how it went, typos and all. \n\nHim: hi! How\u2019s it going other than being bored lol excited that are some places that are now open, I am excited for that so that tells you that I I am so ready for this coronavirus to be over soon! I like your profile. You are very gorgeous and you look like you have a good personality but that\u2019s just from the looks but hoping you do have a good personality. I am open minded, discrete if need be. I am respectful, I am outgoing, and fun! I am looking forward to your reply.\n\nMe: Hey thanks!  I\u2019m actually enjoying the solitude. I can just hang out with myself all day. I love it. So, what kind of arrangement are you looking for?\n\nThis guy: oh so you are a loner! No I am not interested on loner, no personality and not very smart as well\n\n   And then he blocked me lol \n\nI was shocked and so amused at the fact that my response would warrant such a hasty and dramatic exit. I didn\u2019t realize my peaceful mental state would be so triggering for this dude! So, I don\u2019t really have a question but I am curious to know what he was thinking. Someone please make sense of this nonsense\n\nEdit: I know edits are corny but I just had to say that in all my years of being on reddit, you all have been THE most supportive,  positive, and funny group of strangers. And it just warms my cold, black heart. It might be the quarantine that\u2019s got me in my feels but either way, you all pass the vibe check",

I can just be left alone and I love it.  \n\n(aka-- leave me alone..).  \n\nI just responded in an odd way to another post yesterday and got burned at the stake about it.  I meant the exact opposite but said it wrong.  \n\nNow the blocking.. that's a bit extreme.  I don't think you did anything wrong but somehow they took it that way.  It happens.  All you can do is move on in life.  Life is waaaay too short.  I believe there shouldn't be a block button. It allows people to be rude at a whim :)",
