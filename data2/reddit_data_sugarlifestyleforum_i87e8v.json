    "body": "I don't know how many women I actually asked, but these are my hilarious results. I received replies varying from 'hehehehe' to 'I'm interested, tell me more'\n\n14 matches:\n- 7 chatted and flirted, but ultimately went nowhere\n- 2 catfish\n- 1 M&G scheduled that flaked last minute\n- 2 M&Gs actuated with sugar intentions  \n  - 1 used to sugar. We met. Got drunk. Went back to my hotel. Physical chemistry was \n    terrible once we started getting intimate. Quite possibly the worst foreplay I've \n    ever experienced in my life. Did not seal the deal since I wasn't feeling it. I \n    gave her our agreed to PPM and sent her on her way.\n  - 1 was new to sugar but interested. We met. Incredibly shy. No physical chemistry.\n- 2 vanilla dates(these two thought I was just being flirty asking about sugar)\n  - 1 very innocent dinner date where she played footsie with me and gazed at me the\n    entire time with her pretty brown eyes. I'm seeing her again next week.\n  - 1 not so innocent dinner date that ended with us fucking all night. I've since\n    hooked up with her more times than I can count on one hand. She charts high on \n    the crazy to hot scale and I had to end things.\n\n10/10 would do again.",

Like the poster suggested, I googled the hot/crazy line and the results it got me informed me that this is a misogynistic notion. Don't be verbally imprecise and then get mad at me for not reading you with the best intentions. Also let's not lose sight of the fact that we're in a sugaring subforum where lots of people exhibit misogynistic behavior on the daily. Assuming misogyny in an environment where it thrives is not only a form of rational self-protection but entirely reasonable. I think you're mistakenly laboring under the impression that \"you hate an entire gender\" is an a sick burn",

Got tested before I began my escapades. Results were negative so I proceeded.\n\n2. Had a conversation with every potential partner about Corona risks, worries, and how much exposure I've had. I also asked about their daily exposure to the general public. Luckily, we all work remotely and are limited in daily exposure. \n\n3. Was open and honest with each woman that I am seeing other women and how that could potentially be an issue.\n\n4. Met them in public and outdoors(outdoor dining is open in my area).\n\n\n\nI know my risks tolerance personally, and leave it up to my partners if they'd like to meet.",

Average to below-average men have trouble get matched with or even a single response from below-average women on tinder.  \n\nI'm successful with a prestigious career, in great shape, and very comfortable financially,  but I'm a solid 7... and 4 inches short of 6 feet.   Tinder was almost pointless for me.",

Was open and honest with each woman that I am seeing other women and how that could potentially be an issue.\n\n4.

Don't be verbally imprecise and then get mad at me for not reading you with the best intentions. Also let's not lose sight of the fact that we're in a sugaring subforum where lots of people exhibit misogynistic behavior on the daily. Assuming misogyny in an environment where it thrives is not only a form of rational self-protection but entirely reasonable. I think you're mistakenly laboring under the impression that \"you hate an entire gender\" is an a sick burn",

Also let's not lose sight of the fact that we're in a sugaring subforum where lots of people exhibit misogynistic behavior on the daily. Assuming misogyny in an environment where it thrives is not only a form of rational self-protection but entirely reasonable.
