            "body": "My first recommendation is to stop shampooing your hair as often. There's a lot of guys here who just want to plug the whole \"No Shampoo\" lifestyle (and I'm generally one of them), but your hair is really dry looking here. I would always get good results with dandruff shampoo, like Head and Shoulders. But again, less of it.\n\nNext, I would invest in some product. Some matte product, or a clay - preferably no oily pomades. Maybe Crew Fiber, Redken Outplay, or something to that effect. Lots of people swear by Claymation, Hans de Fuko. A hair dryer also helps with maintaining a particular hairstyle, as it helps form the hair, and control how it holds when it's dry.\n\nFor styling and cutting, there's a couple ways you could go.\n\nFirst, you could do the classic \"long on top, short sides and back\" that this sub recommends so often. It's a trendy look right now, and it fits a lot of different hair types and facial structures. I'd need to see some more angles of your current style at this length though, before I could send pics your way. At the very least, I'd look at some of the hairstyles Nick Jonas has had lately.\n\nPossibility number two, you go very short, and rock a messy top like [Jake Gyllenhaal](http://www.coolmenhairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/Mens-Hairstyles-For-Thick-Hair-50.jpg) in this picture. With practice, you could even start cutting your own hair, but you should really get more into styling before you start dicking around with cutting your own hair. Get a good grasp on styling first and foremost. Otherwise, this style is fairly low-maintenance, and will mostly just require a bit of product on the top. The sides and back will stay tame because it's not long enough to go wild.\n\nYou could try leaving some length on the top and sides and go for a kind of short, wild, messy look. You might be able to pull off something like [this](http://img.lum.dolimg.com/v1/images/ralph-headretina_f6ef0c9b.jpeg). That might be more maintenance than you want to put into your hair on a day to day basis. That would take blow drying and product, and you said you don't do either.\n\nYou could also always just buzz it. That's not a recommendation I generally make to people, but I feel like you could pull it off with your facial structure. This is more if you want super low maintenance, and aren't super attached to having lengthy hair. Just an option I'm throwing out there.\n\nGood luck!",

I don't think they necessarily have to be super tight or faded, but I strongly believe they need to be much shorter. The top is a bit more tricky. Honestly, I'd go for a shorter-medium hairstyle, but I'd consult your barber's opinion to see if you can get away with a longer top. \n\nWhat's your current hair routine? What shampoos (if any) and conditioners do you use and how often do you use them? Also, what's your hair type (wavy, straight, thin, thick) and do you use any hair oils for your hair? It appears to me that you may need a slight change in your current hair routine. Nothing major, but I think it can go a long way. ",

No, seriously though, I use female hair products on my hair because most of them tend to work better. For shampoo, you definitely want to go with a product that's sulfate-free that'll prevent damage to your hair and you definitely don't want to use it everyday. I'd personally avoid most male shampoos. Anything that's a 2 in 1 or a 5 in 1 (I can't believe I used to use those) are a big no no and should be avoided at all costs. Shampoo isn't something you need to spend a lot of money on because you shouldn't be using it that much anyways. I use shampoo like twice a week and my hair is find, but it all depends on your hair type so I'd start by shampooing every other day and then gradually seeing if you can get away with shampooing less throughout the week. For conditioner, I'd definitely hawk your mom's products. I use Big Sexy Hair since I have really thick hair and it works great for me. But for conditioner you definitely want something with arginine in it and like shampoo, you only need to use it as much as you shampoo. \n\nSince your hair is thick and wavy I think you'd be able to use heavier products like a clay or a wax. This is definitely a talk for your barber since it all depends on style and personal preference, but my personal opinion is you can use heavier products if you want to since it won't weigh your hair down like it would with thinner hair. \n\nI'd highly look into choosing a style you want to go for when you do decide to see a barber. Since you have thick hair, I'd recommend looking at pictures of thick haired celebrities like Zac Effron and Chris Hemmingworth to get an idea of what look you want to go for. \n\nSorry if my post is a bit of a formatting mess, I'm a bit tired but I really hope this helps!",

No, seriously though, I use female hair products on my hair because most of them tend to work better. For shampoo, you definitely want to go with a product that's sulfate-free that'll prevent damage to your hair and you definitely don't want to use it everyday. I'd personally avoid most male shampoos. Anything that's a 2 in 1 or a 5 in 1 (I can't believe I used to use those) are a big no no and should be avoided at all costs. Shampoo isn't something you need to spend a lot of money on because you shouldn't be using it that much anyways. I use shampoo like twice a week and my hair is find, but it all depends on your hair type so I'd start by shampooing every other day and then gradually seeing if you can get away with shampooing less throughout the week. For conditioner, I'd definitely hawk your mom's products. I use Big Sexy Hair since I have really thick hair and it works great for me. But for conditioner you definitely want something with arginine in it and like shampoo, you only need to use it as much as you shampoo. \n\nSince your hair is thick and wavy I think you'd be able to use heavier products like a clay or a wax. This is definitely a talk for your barber since it all depends on style and personal preference, but my personal opinion is you can use heavier products if you want to since it won't weigh your hair down like it would with thinner hair. \n\nI'd highly look into choosing a style you want to go for when you do decide to see a barber. Since you have thick hair, I'd recommend looking at pictures of thick haired celebrities like Zac Effron and Chris Hemmingworth to get an idea of what look you want to go for. \n\nSorry if my post is a bit of a formatting mess, I'm a bit tired but I really hope this helps!",

            "body": "If you still live with your parents, honestly I would just steal your mom's hair products. No, seriously though, I use female hair products on my hair because most of them tend to work better. For shampoo, you definitely want to go with a product that's sulfate-free that'll prevent damage to your hair and you definitely don't want to use it everyday. I'd personally avoid most male shampoos. Anything that's a 2 in 1 or a 5 in 1 (I can't believe I used to use those) are a big no no and should be avoided at all costs. Shampoo isn't something you need to spend a lot of money on because you shouldn't be using it that much anyways. I use shampoo like twice a week and my hair is find, but it all depends on your hair type so I'd start by shampooing every other day and then gradually seeing if you can get away with shampooing less throughout the week. For conditioner, I'd definitely hawk your mom's products. I use Big Sexy Hair since I have really thick hair and it works great for me. But for conditioner you definitely want something with arginine in it and like shampoo, you only need to use it as much as you shampoo. \n\nSince your hair is thick and wavy I think you'd be able to use heavier products like a clay or a wax. This is definitely a talk for your barber since it all depends on style and personal preference, but my personal opinion is you can use heavier products if you want to since it won't weigh your hair down like it would with thinner hair. \n\nI'd highly look into choosing a style you want to go for when you do decide to see a barber. Since you have thick hair, I'd recommend looking at pictures of thick haired celebrities like Zac Effron and Chris Hemmingworth to get an idea of what look you want to go for. \n\nSorry if my post is a bit of a formatting mess, I'm a bit tired but I really hope this helps!",
