The 2 phony Hokage Konoha got were PLACEHOLDERS and should have asterisks next to their names and be removed from the mountain. The first 4 Hokage had to ACTUALLY protect Konoha. ALL of them died protecting the village when no one else could. Konoha's existence rested entirely on their shoulders...that's what the real Hokage's responsibilities are.  Naruto was the real Hokage and Itachi before him. I cringe when they show Kakashi and Tsunade on that mountain in later episodes.

Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",

The 2 phony Hokage Konoha got were PLACEHOLDERS and should have asterisks next to their names and be removed from the mountain. The first 4 Hokage had to ACTUALLY protect Konoha. ALL of them died protecting the village when no one else could. Konoha's existence rested entirely on their shoulders...that's what the real Hokage's responsibilities are.  Naruto was the real Hokage and Itachi before him. I cringe when they show Kakashi and Tsunade on that mountain in later episodes.

It's actually a sheer arrogance in which you shove your opinions up everyone's butt and present them as \"the only truth\". Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",

The Elders hated Tsunade constantly putting Naruto in the line of fire because he's the real target.  The point was for Naruto's location to stay a secret (Pain eventually found out on his own when he killed Shizune).  Tsunade intimidated the other two Elders into agreeing that Naruto could save the day, so she sent the frog.  Danzo wasn't so convinced, so he killed the frog behind their backs.\n\nDanzo also had his own goals.  He wanted the village to be destabalized so he could become Hokage and Root could take over, even if it meant a bunch of people dying (he knew Tsunade and Katsuyu could save the majority and the rest would be the price of admission).  But the main purpose was so Pain didn't know where Naruto was.  Akatsuki can't win if they can't find the 9 tails.",

It's actually a sheer arrogance in which you shove your opinions up everyone's butt and present them as \"the only truth\". Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",

I love Kakashi and Tsunade but the idea of them being Hokage like the first 4 is bologna. If Naruto doesn't talk no jutsu Pain and save the village all Konoha would have is Danzo's plan of letting most of the village be destroyed and MAYBE defeat Pain once he is weakened. And the only reason Konoha wasn't destroyed even sooner was because of Itachi keeping Akatsuki from harming it. As soon as he goes all bets are off and Naruto has to save the day.",

It's actually a sheer arrogance in which you shove your opinions up everyone's butt and present them as \"the only truth\". Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",

The Elders hated Tsunade constantly putting Naruto in the line of fire because he's the real target.  The point was for Naruto's location to stay a secret (Pain eventually found out on his own when he killed Shizune).  Tsunade intimidated the other two Elders into agreeing that Naruto could save the day, so she sent the frog.  Danzo wasn't so convinced, so he killed the frog behind their backs.\n\nDanzo also had his own goals.  He wanted the village to be destabalized so he could become Hokage and Root could take over, even if it meant a bunch of people dying (he knew Tsunade and Katsuyu could save the majority and the rest would be the price of admission).  But the main purpose was so Pain didn't know where Naruto was.  Akatsuki can't win if they can't find the 9 tails.",

It's actually a sheer arrogance in which you shove your opinions up everyone's butt and present them as \"the only truth\". Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",

Tsunade intimidated the other two Elders into agreeing that Naruto could save the day, so she sent the frog.  Danzo wasn't so convinced, so he killed the frog behind their backs.\n\nDanzo also had his own goals.  He wanted the village to be destabalized so he could become Hokage and Root could take over, even if it meant a bunch of people dying (he knew Tsunade and Katsuyu could save the majority and the rest would be the price of admission).

It's actually a sheer arrogance in which you shove your opinions up everyone's butt and present them as \"the only truth\". Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",

The Elders hated Tsunade constantly putting Naruto in the line of fire because he's the real target.  The point was for Naruto's location to stay a secret (Pain eventually found out on his own when he killed Shizune).  Tsunade intimidated the other two Elders into agreeing that Naruto could save the day, so she sent the frog.  Danzo wasn't so convinced, so he killed the frog behind their backs.\n\nDanzo also had his own goals.  He wanted the village to be destabalized so he could become Hokage and Root could take over, even if it meant a bunch of people dying (he knew Tsunade and Katsuyu could save the majority and the rest would be the price of admission).  But the main purpose was so Pain didn't know where Naruto was.  Akatsuki can't win if they can't find the 9 tails.",

It's actually a sheer arrogance in which you shove your opinions up everyone's butt and present them as \"the only truth\". Everyone, who disagrees with you is in your eyes inferior, and when someone brushes you off, you edit your comments to such an extent that it gets new meaning, in (presumably) an attempt to make yourself look superior. You see, I don't care what you're rooting for, but if you have an opinion, stand by it and stop contradicting yourself, it makes you look like 12yo spoiled brat who'll do no matter what to have an upper hand, but at the end of a day, it's that kid who gets a whallop, because it pisses off a lot of people.\n\nIf I should get a more stimulating life (I'm working at the Day Care Center, can't get more stimulating than that), you should seek a help of a psychiatrist, since I have a suspicion on you from suffering either from BPD, or you're just an idiot",
