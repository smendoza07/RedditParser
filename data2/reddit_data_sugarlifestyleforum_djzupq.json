    "body": "[The Campsite Rule](https://danq.me/2008/05/14/campsite/)\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a sexual relationship with somebody significantly younger or less-experienced than you, the rule that applies at campsites shall be applicable to you: you must leave them in at least as good a state (physically and emotionally) as you found them in. That means no STDs, no unwanted pregnancy, not overburdening them with your emotional or sexual baggage, and so on. Younger partners and particularly virgins will often take everything given to them by an older, more experienced partner as being \u201cwritten in stone,\u201d and will carry around everything they learn from them for the rest of their life: so treat them right.\u201d",

It\u2019s called integrity.\n\nAnd I realize this may sound rather detached, but I believe there needs to be an element of detachment in these types of relationships, which is precisely why I am not in favor of calling it a \u201csugar relationship\u201d.  I call it an arrangement because that\u2019s what it is. It is fine to like each other and enjoy each other\u2018s company, but save the emotional involvement and resultant attachment for a real love relationship.  \n\nThere is a very good reason why allowance is offered; money is the great equalizer. That way, no one is responsible for anyone else\u2019s feelings, and everyone makes their own choices.\n\nI also don\u2019t believe that anyone under 25 should ever enter an arrangement. You simply don\u2019t have the maturity before that to handle what may arise. Speaking for myself, I barely had the maturity at that age (25 was the age at which I entered my first arrangement) and would\u2019ve been better off waiting at least another five years.\nThat said\u2026 I absolutely do believe in leaving every man better than I found him.  I believe that wholeheartedly. And... that does not mean I\u2019m responsible for his feelings. Both people are responsible for their own feelings, their own choices, and their own behavior.  \n\nAnd, spiritually speaking, whatever happens to you in this life is a lesson that you needed to learn, even if it seems like someone did something unkind, unfair, or wrong to you... however, that does not give anyone carte blanche to treat others in a callous, uncaring manner.  \nWhen they do, it\u2019s not always easy to suspend judgment of another\u2019s actions towards us and move into acceptance for what happens to us, but it is essential for our spiritual growth.  And that doesn\u2019t mean we blame ourselves for what happens to us, but we do take personal responsibility for how we react to it.",
