I had no worries as he more than well looked after me. Fast forward 6 months of us together and I found out we were expecting our daughter. He\u2019s 33 years older than myself. Neither of us had any previous children. We decided to carry on with the pregnancy with himself looking forward to being an older dad.\n\nFast forward 5 years later and unfortunately our SR didn\u2019t work in the long term. We ended up staying together for 3.5 years and having another second daughter together. We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine. A real mix of a SR turning into vanilla but didn\u2019t work for numerous reasons.\n\nMy children have a very happy and \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\nI also still happily sugar date in my childfree time.",

Also the site itself could be a little more relaxed on providing certain details (if you're open to feedback).\n\nI met a lot of really great people by paying for lunch dates and adding a little spending money. I also paid for meet-ups so we had a positive foundation. This is really important for creating an atmosphere of mutual respect but right now you get moderated for mentioning money.\n\nHappy to share more if you're ever interested.

Hookup culture has emotionally stunted so many people who don't realize that its not enough to just \"be yourself\" and DTF. You need to grow and take responsibility for your life. You need to be a good partner. Tinder does not teach you this.\n2. People who never invested in a real relationship prior to 30+ are unfortunately more likely to just never bother with it, so they just keep dating hoping to find someone who is fine with all their shortcomings.\n3. Current cultural climate of \"accept me as I am but YOU need to be better\" where everybody expects everybody to improve even though they won't hold themselves to that standard.\n\nI realize we're off topic at this point but you're touching on something I care a lot about and it bothers me most people probably don't even see the issue.",

He isn\u2019t getting married to save himself from Fosta/ Sesta..they literally do NOT care. Sure, his marriage is for optics but not for fosta/ sesta heat. If that was an issue, they would have gone after him long LONG ago. The people who make the optics sex trafficking laws are the same who use his services, like the Matt Gaetz\u2019s. Gaetz worked in the department overseeing his investigation. Lol it\u2019s a joke. But, Brandon is getting a little heat from other places due to the potential for trafficking, underage girls or assault his site has been a conduit of. But again, no one really cares in the US govt. because again, they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy take is he already has the past marketing of what his website really is. There is no need for him to literally call it what it is anymore. People in the know already are aware through past marketing, media and word of mouth. So essentially there really is no reason for him to advertise it as such anymore.",

The sugar lifestyle is not prostitution and love can definitely be found in the sugar community. Sugaring does not equate to prostitution it doesn\u2019t even equate to sex work. Honestly sugaring could just mean that you are a spoiled girlfriend or a spoiled wife. I don\u2019t know the whole thing is crazy to me but seeking arrangement or seeking as he calls it now has gone way downhill the past few years and is quite a joke in the sugaring community Because it\u2019s become nothing but scams and is known for scams and everybody knows it even he knows that so he\u2019s just trying to do whatever he can to save himself and his poor excuse of a site",

You can be a jeffry Epstein level or a street corner pimp .. both are business savvy making profit.\n \nI totally agree with your assessment of spoiled girlfriends or wives being in arrangements. A spoiled, well kept woman is what sugaring used to mean. I feel like seeking A. ruined so much and peoples perceptions of what a real arrangement entails. But the website IS used for sex workers, whether the girls realize they are being used as such or not..by clients offering pay per play and PPMS. And often, most of the time, using naive girls who are unknowingly being used as grossly underpaid alternatives to pro sex workers who would laugh at the ppms, which are not even allowed on the site to begin with but everyone knows they are. Tells you what the law considers pay per meets PPMs and what they really constitute, along with most anyone else. The site does allow talk of a monthly allowance though. \n\nThe cat is already it if the bag, so to speak, many years ago so he doesn\u2019t even have to bother stating what his site really is.",

The prenups I\u2019ve had are for something to happen if/when there\u2019s a divorce. \n\nThe \u201cagreement\u201d I noted is where a property, car, lump sum of cash, possibly shares in a company, etc are put into the other person\u2019s name before the marriage.  It\u2019s all theirs immediately no matter what happens. That\u2019s all that\u2019s they are getting.  If there are children born subsequent to the marriage, the procedures are already accounted for and agreed to. \n\nI\u2019m sure non disclosure agreements are included to safeguard all parties. Its drafted, signed, and left with the relevant courts. \n\nIt takes all of the drama out of getting divorced. If the person was marrying you for financial gain, then they are free to walk away.  \n\nBy the way, the only people I know who went this route were extremely wealthy from generations of family money. This is the only way to safeguard the family wealth.  It comes at a high price, but usually nonnegotiable unless you are the only family member alive.",

In that time I used SA to see what it was like sugaring compared to over in the UK. I had used SA previously for over 2 years prior to being in Australia\u2026 \n\nMyself and my SD (at the time) became very attached quickly, I ended up moving in with him over in Australia and we basically became in an exclusive SR. I had no worries as he more than well looked after me. Fast forward 6 months of us together and I found out we were expecting our daughter. He\u2019s 33 years older than myself. Neither of us had any previous children. We decided to carry on with the pregnancy with himself looking forward to being an older dad.\n\nFast forward 5 years later and unfortunately our SR didn\u2019t work in the long term. We ended up staying together for 3.5 years and having another second daughter together. We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine. A real mix of a SR turning into vanilla but didn\u2019t work for numerous reasons.\n\nMy children have a very happy and \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\nI also still happily sugar date in my childfree time.",

I also paid for meet-ups so we had a positive foundation.

You need to be a good partner. Tinder does not teach you this.\n2. People who never invested in a real relationship prior to 30+ are unfortunately more likely to just never bother with it, so they just keep dating hoping to find someone who is fine with all their shortcomings.\n3. Current cultural climate of \"accept me as I am but YOU need to be better\" where everybody expects everybody to improve even though they won't hold themselves to that standard.\n\nI realize we're off topic at this point but you're touching on something I care a lot about and it bothers me most people probably don't even see the issue.",

He isn\u2019t getting married to save himself from Fosta/ Sesta..they literally do NOT care. Sure, his marriage is for optics but not for fosta/ sesta heat. If that was an issue, they would have gone after him long LONG ago. The people who make the optics sex trafficking laws are the same who use his services, like the Matt Gaetz\u2019s. Gaetz worked in the department overseeing his investigation. Lol it\u2019s a joke. But, Brandon is getting a little heat from other places due to the potential for trafficking, underage girls or assault his site has been a conduit of. But again, no one really cares in the US govt. because again, they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy take is he already has the past marketing of what his website really is. There is no need for him to literally call it what it is anymore. People in the know already are aware through past marketing, media and word of mouth. So essentially there really is no reason for him to advertise it as such anymore.",

The sugar lifestyle is not prostitution and love can definitely be found in the sugar community. Sugaring does not equate to prostitution it doesn\u2019t even equate to sex work. Honestly sugaring could just mean that you are a spoiled girlfriend or a spoiled wife. I don\u2019t know the whole thing is crazy to me but seeking arrangement or seeking as he calls it now has gone way downhill the past few years and is quite a joke in the sugaring community Because it\u2019s become nothing but scams and is known for scams and everybody knows it even he knows that so he\u2019s just trying to do whatever he can to save himself and his poor excuse of a site",

You can be a jeffry Epstein level or a street corner pimp .. both are business savvy making profit.\n \nI totally agree with your assessment of spoiled girlfriends or wives being in arrangements. A spoiled, well kept woman is what sugaring used to mean. I feel like seeking A. ruined so much and peoples perceptions of what a real arrangement entails. But the website IS used for sex workers, whether the girls realize they are being used as such or not..by clients offering pay per play and PPMS.

Tells you what the law considers pay per meets PPMs and what they really constitute, along with most anyone else. The site does allow talk of a monthly allowance though. \n\nThe cat is already it if the bag, so to speak, many years ago so he doesn\u2019t even have to bother stating what his site really is.",

The prenups I\u2019ve had are for something to happen if/when there\u2019s a divorce. \n\nThe \u201cagreement\u201d I noted is where a property, car, lump sum of cash, possibly shares in a company, etc are put into the other person\u2019s name before the marriage.  It\u2019s all theirs immediately no matter what happens. That\u2019s all that\u2019s they are getting.  If there are children born subsequent to the marriage, the procedures are already accounted for and agreed to. \n\nI\u2019m sure non disclosure agreements are included to safeguard all parties. Its drafted, signed, and left with the relevant courts. \n\nIt takes all of the drama out of getting divorced. If the person was marrying you for financial gain, then they are free to walk away.  \n\nBy the way, the only people I know who went this route were extremely wealthy from generations of family money. This is the only way to safeguard the family wealth.  It comes at a high price, but usually nonnegotiable unless you are the only family member alive.",

We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine.

People who never invested in a real relationship prior to 30+ are unfortunately more likely to just never bother with it, so they just keep dating hoping to find someone who is fine with all their shortcomings.\n3. Current cultural climate of \"accept me as I am but YOU need to be better\" where everybody expects everybody to improve even though they won't hold themselves to that standard.\n\nI realize we're off topic at this point but you're touching on something I care a lot about and it bothers me most people probably don't even see the issue.",

And it is coming down on him for good reason, given the Matt Gaetz scandal in the USA, and underage procurement of girls on the cheap. He has become, and always was IMO,  nothing more than a nasty, internet pimp making money off the backs of naive girls who are often unknowingly being exploited as underpaid sex workers. And, the fact he has always used his own website for personal hookups and manipulation to get girls to sleep with him, is actually a very dark grey area where it is not only immoral but also a conflict of interest legally. Especially since he never offered an allowance.",

He isn\u2019t getting married to save himself from Fosta/ Sesta..they literally do NOT care. Sure, his marriage is for optics but not for fosta/ sesta heat. If that was an issue, they would have gone after him long LONG ago. The people who make the optics sex trafficking laws are the same who use his services, like the Matt Gaetz\u2019s. Gaetz worked in the department overseeing his investigation. Lol it\u2019s a joke. But, Brandon is getting a little heat from other places due to the potential for trafficking, underage girls or assault his site has been a conduit of. But again, no one really cares in the US govt. because again, they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy take is he already has the past marketing of what his website really is. There is no need for him to literally call it what it is anymore. People in the know already are aware through past marketing, media and word of mouth. So essentially there really is no reason for him to advertise it as such anymore.",

Because if anybody saw his interview years back when the site first came out I believe it was with Dr. Phil but I could be wrong but anyways what he was saying was totally and completely the opposite of what he saying now and it\u2019s totally fine for people to change their opinions but when you\u2019ve created a site completely based around a certain community I just find it ridiculous to now go back and change everything up and act like you were better than everybody who is in the sugar lifestyle just because you found true love? The sugar lifestyle is not prostitution and love can definitely be found in the sugar community. Sugaring does not equate to prostitution it doesn\u2019t even equate to sex work. Honestly sugaring could just mean that you are a spoiled girlfriend or a spoiled wife. I don\u2019t know the whole thing is crazy to me but seeking arrangement or seeking as he calls it now has gone way downhill the past few years and is quite a joke in the sugaring community Because it\u2019s become nothing but scams and is known for scams and everybody knows it even he knows that so he\u2019s just trying to do whatever he can to save himself and his poor excuse of a site",

You can be a jeffry Epstein level or a street corner pimp .. both are business savvy making profit.\n \nI totally agree with your assessment of spoiled girlfriends or wives being in arrangements. A spoiled, well kept woman is what sugaring used to mean. I feel like seeking A. ruined so much and peoples perceptions of what a real arrangement entails. But the website IS used for sex workers, whether the girls realize they are being used as such or not..by clients offering pay per play and PPMS. And often, most of the time, using naive girls who are unknowingly being used as grossly underpaid alternatives to pro sex workers who would laugh at the ppms, which are not even allowed on the site to begin with but everyone knows they are. Tells you what the law considers pay per meets PPMs and what they really constitute, along with most anyone else. The site does allow talk of a monthly allowance though. \n\nThe cat is already it if the bag, so to speak, many years ago so he doesn\u2019t even have to bother stating what his site really is.",

He isn\u2019t getting married to save himself from Fosta/ Sesta..they literally do NOT care. Sure, his marriage is for optics but not for fosta/ sesta heat. If that was an issue, they would have gone after him long LONG ago. The people who make the optics sex trafficking laws are the same who use his services, like the Matt Gaetz\u2019s. Gaetz worked in the department overseeing his investigation. Lol it\u2019s a joke. But, Brandon is getting a little heat from other places due to the potential for trafficking, underage girls or assault his site has been a conduit of. But again, no one really cares in the US govt. because again, they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy take is he already has the past marketing of what his website really is. There is no need for him to literally call it what it is anymore. People in the know already are aware through past marketing, media and word of mouth. So essentially there really is no reason for him to advertise it as such anymore.",

He might be smart with business but most pimps are! They make money off the backs of women via a male paying clientele. You can be a jeffry Epstein level or a street corner pimp .. both are business savvy making profit.\n \nI totally agree with your assessment of spoiled girlfriends or wives being in arrangements. A spoiled, well kept woman is what sugaring used to mean. I feel like seeking A. ruined so much and peoples perceptions of what a real arrangement entails. But the website IS used for sex workers, whether the girls realize they are being used as such or not..by clients offering pay per play and PPMS. And often, most of the time, using naive girls who are unknowingly being used as grossly underpaid alternatives to pro sex workers who would laugh at the ppms, which are not even allowed on the site to begin with but everyone knows they are. Tells you what the law considers pay per meets PPMs and what they really constitute, along with most anyone else. The site does allow talk of a monthly allowance though. \n\nThe cat is already it if the bag, so to speak, many years ago so he doesn\u2019t even have to bother stating what his site really is.",

In that time I used SA to see what it was like sugaring compared to over in the UK.

I had no worries as he more than well looked after me. Fast forward 6 months of us together and I found out we were expecting our daughter. He\u2019s 33 years older than myself. Neither of us had any previous children. We decided to carry on with the pregnancy with himself looking forward to being an older dad.\n\nFast forward 5 years later and unfortunately our SR didn\u2019t work in the long term. We ended up staying together for 3.5 years and having another second daughter together. We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine.

Hookup culture has emotionally stunted so many people who don't realize that its not enough to just \"be yourself\" and DTF. You need to grow and take responsibility for your life. You need to be a good partner. Tinder does not teach you this.\n2. People who never invested in a real relationship prior to 30+ are unfortunately more likely to just never bother with it, so they just keep dating hoping to find someone who is fine with all their shortcomings.\n3. Current cultural climate of \"accept me as I am but YOU need to be better\" where everybody expects everybody to improve even though they won't hold themselves to that standard.\n\nI realize we're off topic at this point but you're touching on something I care a lot about and it bothers me most people probably don't even see the issue.",

He isn\u2019t getting married to save himself from Fosta/ Sesta..they literally do NOT care. Sure, his marriage is for optics but not for fosta/ sesta heat. If that was an issue, they would have gone after him long LONG ago. The people who make the optics sex trafficking laws are the same who use his services, like the Matt Gaetz\u2019s. Gaetz worked in the department overseeing his investigation. Lol it\u2019s a joke. But, Brandon is getting a little heat from other places due to the potential for trafficking, underage girls or assault his site has been a conduit of. But again, no one really cares in the US govt. because again, they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy take is he already has the past marketing of what his website really is. There is no need for him to literally call it what it is anymore. People in the know already are aware through past marketing, media and word of mouth. So essentially there really is no reason for him to advertise it as such anymore.",

In that time I used SA to see what it was like sugaring compared to over in the UK. I had used SA previously for over 2 years prior to being in Australia\u2026 \n\nMyself and my SD (at the time) became very attached quickly, I ended up moving in with him over in Australia and we basically became in an exclusive SR. I had no worries as he more than well looked after me. Fast forward 6 months of us together and I found out we were expecting our daughter. He\u2019s 33 years older than myself. Neither of us had any previous children. We decided to carry on with the pregnancy with himself looking forward to being an older dad.\n\nFast forward 5 years later and unfortunately our SR didn\u2019t work in the long term. We ended up staying together for 3.5 years and having another second daughter together. We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine. A real mix of a SR turning into vanilla but didn\u2019t work for numerous reasons.\n\nMy children have a very happy and \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\nI also still happily sugar date in my childfree time.",

He isn\u2019t getting married to save himself from Fosta/ Sesta..they literally do NOT care. Sure, his marriage is for optics but not for fosta/ sesta heat. If that was an issue, they would have gone after him long LONG ago. The people who make the optics sex trafficking laws are the same who use his services, like the Matt Gaetz\u2019s. Gaetz worked in the department overseeing his investigation. Lol it\u2019s a joke. But, Brandon is getting a little heat from other places due to the potential for trafficking, underage girls or assault his site has been a conduit of. But again, no one really cares in the US govt. because again, they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy take is he already has the past marketing of what his website really is. There is no need for him to literally call it what it is anymore. People in the know already are aware through past marketing, media and word of mouth. So essentially there really is no reason for him to advertise it as such anymore.",

In that time I used SA to see what it was like sugaring compared to over in the UK. I had used SA previously for over 2 years prior to being in Australia\u2026 \n\nMyself and my SD (at the time) became very attached quickly, I ended up moving in with him over in Australia and we basically became in an exclusive SR. I had no worries as he more than well looked after me. Fast forward 6 months of us together and I found out we were expecting our daughter. He\u2019s 33 years older than myself. Neither of us had any previous children. We decided to carry on with the pregnancy with himself looking forward to being an older dad.\n\nFast forward 5 years later and unfortunately our SR didn\u2019t work in the long term. We ended up staying together for 3.5 years and having another second daughter together. We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine. A real mix of a SR turning into vanilla but didn\u2019t work for numerous reasons.\n\nMy children have a very happy and \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\nI also still happily sugar date in my childfree time.",

Hookup culture has emotionally stunted so many people who don't realize that its not enough to just \"be yourself\" and DTF. You need to grow and take responsibility for your life. You need to be a good partner. Tinder does not teach you this.\n2. People who never invested in a real relationship prior to 30+ are unfortunately more likely to just never bother with it, so they just keep dating hoping to find someone who is fine with all their shortcomings.\n3. Current cultural climate of \"accept me as I am but YOU need to be better\" where everybody expects everybody to improve even though they won't hold themselves to that standard.\n\nI realize we're off topic at this point but you're touching on something I care a lot about and it bothers me most people probably don't even see the issue.",

I had used SA previously for over 2 years prior to being in Australia\u2026 \n\nMyself and my SD (at the time) became very attached quickly, I ended up moving in with him over in Australia and we basically became in an exclusive SR. I had no worries as he more than well looked after me. Fast forward 6 months of us together and I found out we were expecting our daughter. He\u2019s 33 years older than myself. Neither of us had any previous children. We decided to carry on with the pregnancy with himself looking forward to being an older dad.\n\nFast forward 5 years later and unfortunately our SR didn\u2019t work in the long term. We ended up staying together for 3.5 years and having another second daughter together. We ended on good terms. \nHe moved back to the UK with me, to where I\u2019m originally from and we co parent very well together whilst living separately. \n\nOur daughters are 3 & 4 currently. \n\nSo yes, the strangest things can happen on SA, not yet heard of anyone else with a similar story to mine. A real mix of a SR turning into vanilla but didn\u2019t work for numerous reasons.\n\nMy children have a very happy and \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\nI also still happily sugar date in my childfree time.",

Hookup culture has emotionally stunted so many people who don't realize that its not enough to just \"be yourself\" and DTF. You need to grow and take responsibility for your life. You need to be a good partner. Tinder does not teach you this.\n2. People who never invested in a real relationship prior to 30+ are unfortunately more likely to just never bother with it, so they just keep dating hoping to find someone who is fine with all their shortcomings.\n3. Current cultural climate of \"accept me as I am but YOU need to be better\" where everybody expects everybody to improve even though they won't hold themselves to that standard.\n\nI realize we're off topic at this point but you're touching on something I care a lot about and it bothers me most people probably don't even see the issue.",
