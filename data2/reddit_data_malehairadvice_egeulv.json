            "body": "**Cut:** Have straight hair, longish, at least on top. Like, possibly several months of length, the hair on top is longer than you think. Show your barber the picture, tell him to keep it long on top and blend the sides to match. This is not an undercut either, the sides shouldn't be clipped down very far. Like, the top of the sides should be at least a 4, possibly even up to an 8, getting shorter as it gets closer to your ear. You just comb the sides back with some water/product.\n\n**Style:** Towel dry your hair in the morning after showering, comb the shorter hairs to the left, the longer hairs to the right (or vice versa), then hold down the short hairs on the side with your hand (to keep them damp and flat) and blow dry the hair on top from the opposite side until it's mostly dry. I would turn your head to the side or upside down to help get the lift in your hair while you're drying. Take a dime-sized bit of layrite super hold wax and sweep the longer hairs to the right and back. Comb the hair on the sides back along the sides of your head, rewetting that part if you need to.\n\nEDIT: I just saw your picture! Nice, you have all the length you'll need, plenty of lift, so you'll want the barber to keep MOST of it, but blend it into the sides of your hair. I would do the way you part it in your second picture if you want it like the model, because it's less of a straight swoop and more \"pompadour-y\". Use more product like layrite super hold wax, both on top to swoop it back a bit more, and on the sides to get them to mat down rather than sticking out. You may also want to experiment with leaving it longer on the sides so can comb them back rather than them just sticking out. In fact, I would experiment with it even before going to the barber. If you style it right, with this cut you can put off going to the barber for a long time. You're almost there.",
