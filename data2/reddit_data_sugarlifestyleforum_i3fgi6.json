    "body": "We often see posts about terrible stuff in profiles, but for some positivity - guys and gals, what are some of the best **original** profile one-liners you've seen? The ones that immediately drew your attention and made you chuckle and go 'ooooo, nice!'\n\nJust saw two on profiles that I want to share.\n\n>The best things in life are free.  The second best things in life cost a lot of money.  I'm looking for someone to share both with ;)\n\nAnd,\n\n>Not looking for someone to buy me the latest Audi, BMW, or McLaren. An older version is perfectly fine.\n\nThese two immediately made me think, \"Yeah, this lady would probably be *fun* to hang out with.\"",
