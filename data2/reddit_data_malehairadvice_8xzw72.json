Throughout the movie, his hair is blow dried, then slicked back from his face fairly close to his scalp. This is the natural effect of his hair falling after a day of business, but you can still start at this point. If you're good at blow drying and you use enough hairspray, you can keep your hair fairly on point for about 12 hours or so.",
