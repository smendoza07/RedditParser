Also using products that add weight to your hair like hair oils or leave in conditioners can tame the waves / poofyness too. I have a similar hair type that gives tons of natural volume and can go wavy if left alone but I like to keep it mostly straight and under control for now, might switch over to my matte products soon to try out more natural looks but I'm not in much of a rush to do it.",

Then I wet it in the morning and put a hat on backwards to pull my hair back while I get ready. If you shower in the morning, you can just do the hat part. Once you do your hair, it will stay back much easier. Only took a few days of doing this method but a day to undo if I forget.",
