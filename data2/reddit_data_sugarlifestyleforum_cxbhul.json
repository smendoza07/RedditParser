    "body": "There were a few times I thought I was crazy, I probably am - but I really fell for you. I was never supposed to and I'm not sure you did anything but be yourself - but here I am realizing I love you. \n\nSo many times I've looked into your blue eyes, wishing I could be yours. So many dates I watched your smile turn into a laugh. You've grown so much as a person and I'm so proud of you for wanting to be better. I understand why you cant have me in your life. You deserve all the happiness in the world. \n\nYou made me feel safe, my first and only SD. I never even referenced you as such, not even in my head, you've always been my friend. You were my promise to be protected against this ugly world and you did such a good job. \n\nI've had to move on with life and I'm happy now. We don't talk. And you have no idea. I never told you. I never hinted. I never even cared about the sugar, I thought you should know I really cared about you. \n\nAnyway, life has been kind to us both. I guess this is my own personal way of saying goodbye and admitting what I knew was true. \n\nI miss you and I just wanted to say I loved you.",
