The whole shippuuden orbits around akatsuki and their ultimate goal which is the infinite tsukuyomi. Nobody knew the infinite tsukuyomi even existed, not to mention the fact that it can bring to life someone like Kaguya. But that was exactly what it was meant to do. She's basically the ultimate personalization of humanity's hatred (and consequently love - for her sons which was turned into hatred), she also represents all the hateful events that happened in the world - that the black zetsu was using and manipulating to ressurect Kaguya - ashura and indra's conflict, uchiha's ocular jutsu being the result of incredible love for the family and siblings and turned into hatred like in madara or obito, and countless of other little spiteful events happening over millenia that led to her ressurection.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

One shot death for the most powerful shinobi in history? I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

You're finally useful but moments later you get crushed by a rock, lose everything you have, everyone thinks you're dead and no one is looking for you.

After finally being able to see your friend after months/years, the moment you see her she commits suicide. I think you'd be pissed too",

At first I thought he was corny, but after I finished and really thought about the show I really understood. Obito is a parallel to a version of Naruto who lost hope, and the show couldn't make that any more clear. The same way Kakashi is a parallel to a version of Sasuke who found hope. He brings up Rin a lot, but that's because she was literally the only person he had a connection to, the same way Naruto is with Sasuke. The point of Obito is to show the path Naruto could've / most likely should've taken. Naruto had every reason to be like Obito.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

I would appreciate if he redid everything from madaras death just to give satisfaction to the long and loyal naruto readers that felt robbed of a finale.

One shot death for the most powerful shinobi in history? I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

He brings up Rin a lot, but that's because she was literally the only person he had a connection to, the same way Naruto is with Sasuke. The point of Obito is to show the path Naruto could've / most likely should've taken. Naruto had every reason to be like Obito.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

One shot death for the most powerful shinobi in history? I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama. So he dosen't have much battle experience fighting people as strong as he was.",

One shot death for the most powerful shinobi in history? I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

I would appreciate if he redid everything from madaras death just to give satisfaction to the long and loyal naruto readers that felt robbed of a finale.

One shot death for the most powerful shinobi in history? I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

He brings up Rin a lot, but that's because she was literally the only person he had a connection to, the same way Naruto is with Sasuke. The point of Obito is to show the path Naruto could've / most likely should've taken. Naruto had every reason to be like Obito.",

One shot death for the most powerful shinobi in history? I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

She's basically the ultimate personalization of humanity's hatred (and consequently love - for her sons which was turned into hatred), she also represents all the hateful events that happened in the world - that the black zetsu was using and manipulating to ressurect Kaguya - ashura and indra's conflict, uchiha's ocular jutsu being the result of incredible love for the family and siblings and turned into hatred like in madara or obito, and countless of other little spiteful events happening over millenia that led to her ressurection.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

But narutos a cash cow and the show would\u2019ve ended. It\u2019s sad but this is the reality. I would appreciate if he redid everything from madaras death just to give satisfaction to the long and loyal naruto readers that felt robbed of a finale. It might not have to be canon but just to have that split timeline for the sheer satisfaction would be nice.",

I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

Madaraa with out the nine tails would barely be able to beat Tobirama or the the third hokage, Madaraa simply lacked the Chakra to use his rinnegan or Sharingan as effectively without outside help.\n\nSo madaraa does not even have that much experience using his high level sharingan techniques.\n\nThe only reason why Nagato could use the rinnegan was due to the massive inborn reserves of chakra he had as an Uzumaki. Nagato was a better rinnegan user than base Madaraa could ever be.\n\nMadaraa had more combat experience fighting scrubs, that's, for sure, but Madaraa was a big fish in a small pond, in his lifetime the only people who could challenge him was Hashirama and Tobirama.

I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",

I\u2019d rather it end with naruto or sasuke dying in the process of killing him or a full fight and then when he\u2019s weakened and naruto/sasuke are nearly dead, zetsu kills him. But they straight up cancelled the biggest fight in anime history. It is what it is, and we can\u2019t change it. But there\u2019s like zero justification for it other than poor writing and anticipation of losing funds due to the cash cow being milked dry. \n\nAnd to say madara is a relatable character. He isn\u2019t to like 99% of redditors. Maybe even 100%. Myself included. He was a god tier character. And naruto and sasuke worked to become semi-god tier and together could have fought madara. So that\u2019s a moot point tbh. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion and I\u2019m not trying to shit on the show, but that was a horrible creative call and it brought naruto down from legendary status to a redundant power scaling clusterfuck much like the dragonball series.",
