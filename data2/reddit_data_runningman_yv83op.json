Yeah, obviously it just takes too much time. And the hard part isn't even about the translation itself, as long the subber is really competent enough in Korean and English, to begin with. What's difficult is more like positioning and coloring of the text. It's possible in .srt files but soft subs makers don't tend to do that, hard subs is more like it for this case. But again, hard subs would require editing the subtitles inside the video file which means more technical work to be done. At that point, it's not about syncing and language skills anymore.",

It's the default application there to do any form of subtitling. \n\niSubs wrote it out in an .ass subtitle file, then hardcoded it in before releasing it as many other fansubbers did back in the day. It's still a ton of work, but hella easier than trying to do it in a video editor. Once they got the fonts and positioning down in the first few episodes, all that was left for subsequent episodes was doing the actual subbing & timing. They've said back in the day that the most time consuming aspect had been identifying the OST, a convention I'm glad carries on today in newer fansubbing groups because kshows use ost from anywhere and everywhere so liberally. Some differences in copyright law iirc. \n\nI've had some experience with this software in the past by attempting to sub vocaloid music videos (ie dealing with insane amounts of texts & fonts flying about), it's by no means easy to master but it certainly makes these sorts of subtitles much easier to do than simple .srt & trying to do it in premiere pro. \n\nI had always bemoaned that the kvariety/kdrama fansubbing community was snuffed out too quickly before they could really take root like the anime fansubbing community did. But to be fair, that community also has like, [no rules over what makes good readable subs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nqiVJJt3_KY&feature=emb_title) (this is an opening to a show, but the song's been muted due to copyright. The lyrics weren't there originally, but a convention in the community community is to provide lyrics for the openings. It is a pretty good example of how far this subtitle format can take things).\n\nEdit: got a message about being explicit about edits, so for transparency I just finished writing the first paragraph after forgetting to continue it before sending.

But granted, the advantage of simple .srt subs makes them accessible and flexible to any player out there. It does mean a lot of the depth in understanding a show gets lost along the way :( \n\nI saw someone say they used to add translator notes in the subs, which is amazing in introducing the viewer to aspects of the culture and establishing the context for jokes.

It's the default application there to do any form of subtitling. \n\niSubs wrote it out in an .ass subtitle file, then hardcoded it in before releasing it as many other fansubbers did back in the day. It's still a ton of work, but hella easier than trying to do it in a video editor. Once they got the fonts and positioning down in the first few episodes, all that was left for subsequent episodes was doing the actual subbing & timing. They've said back in the day that the most time consuming aspect had been identifying the OST, a convention I'm glad carries on today in newer fansubbing groups because kshows use ost from anywhere and everywhere so liberally. Some differences in copyright law iirc. \n\nI've had some experience with this software in the past by attempting to sub vocaloid music videos (ie dealing with insane amounts of texts & fonts flying about), it's by no means easy to master but it certainly makes these sorts of subtitles much easier to do than simple .srt & trying to do it in premiere pro. \n\nI had always bemoaned that the kvariety/kdrama fansubbing community was snuffed out too quickly before they could really take root like the anime fansubbing community did. But to be fair, that community also has like, [no rules over what makes good readable subs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nqiVJJt3_KY&feature=emb_title) (this is an opening to a show, but the song's been muted due to copyright. The lyrics weren't there originally, but a convention in the community community is to provide lyrics for the openings. It is a pretty good example of how far this subtitle format can take things).\n\nEdit: got a message about being explicit about edits, so for transparency I just finished writing the first paragraph after forgetting to continue it before sending.

            "body": "I highly doubt they used premiere pro to make these subs. \n\nThe anime community developed their own subtitling software like [Aegisub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegisub) to make fansubs like these relatively more easily. It's the default application there to do any form of subtitling. \n\niSubs wrote it out in an .ass subtitle file, then hardcoded it in before releasing it as many other fansubbers did back in the day. It's still a ton of work, but hella easier than trying to do it in a video editor. Once they got the fonts and positioning down in the first few episodes, all that was left for subsequent episodes was doing the actual subbing & timing. They've said back in the day that the most time consuming aspect had been identifying the OST, a convention I'm glad carries on today in newer fansubbing groups because kshows use ost from anywhere and everywhere so liberally. Some differences in copyright law iirc. \n\nI've had some experience with this software in the past by attempting to sub vocaloid music videos (ie dealing with insane amounts of texts & fonts flying about), it's by no means easy to master but it certainly makes these sorts of subtitles much easier to do than simple .srt & trying to do it in premiere pro. \n\nI had always bemoaned that the kvariety/kdrama fansubbing community was snuffed out too quickly before they could really take root like the anime fansubbing community did. But to be fair, that community also has like, [no rules over what makes good readable subs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nqiVJJt3_KY&feature=emb_title) (this is an opening to a show, but the song's been muted due to copyright. The lyrics weren't there originally, but a convention in the community community is to provide lyrics for the openings. It is a pretty good example of how far this subtitle format can take things).\n\nEdit: got a message about being explicit about edits, so for transparency I just finished writing the first paragraph after forgetting to continue it before sending.
