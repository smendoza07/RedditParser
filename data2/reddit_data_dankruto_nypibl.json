I give him credit for off-screening the four tails while injured but that ain\u2019t a feat compared to Madara lol\nAlso he only goes Sage Mode once (in his serious fight) and that\u2019s on a mission to gather Intel. Idk if he\u2019d attempt Sage Mode if in a battle with an immediate threat like Madara. He\u2019d need to do what he did before and run away until he has gathered his team. \n\nTsunade is key as she can counter the Susanoo for a brief scuffle and regen like crazy. \nOrochimaru looked at the armored Susanoo and smiled like an evil fucker before turning into a literal hydra. This dude immediately started phasing the Susanoo and only lost so quickly because of an ethereal one-shot weapon. \nSo if anyone is gonna do what Tsunade did, it\u2019d be Orochimaru. \n\nTsunade\u2019s kinda a fuckin idiot for not using her summon to try and melt the Susanoo so maybe a different Sanin would give it a shot? Their summons don\u2019t have corrosive attacks tho. Author intent seems to lead to the idea that the main summons are generic tailed beast level without any large scale attacks (besides Tsunade\u2019s summon). \n\nSo if you wanna wank Orochimaru\u2019s large-scale-combat ability, you could say he summons his main snake (and any amount of inferior snakes) and goes full hydra for a total of 2 large threats (and any amount of smaller threats). Maybe the snakes can play biting bumper carts with Madara\u2019s clones? lmao\n\nMadara can\u2019t just slice Orochimaru and hope for a win. The dude can throw up a new body whenever he wants or stitch himself back together. Madara would need to squish him or vaporize him. \n\nBut uh, Madara can use clones of clones with Susanoo and wood style so squishing is gonna happen. \n\nOrochimaru ain\u2019t doin shit but hold back 2 of the Susanoos out of the 5 that would be summoned on him. Wank his hydra to multi Susanoo level and all he\u2019d earn is extra attention from Madara lmao\n\nIf he distracts enough maybe a particle style would actually land? Idk. \n\nAll it would take is a perfect Susanoo to stop the shenanigans though. The Kage vs Madara was like a team of Jonin going up against an S Rank ninja. \n\n\nJiraiya comes back with his Sage Mode activated. He rode his trusty toad steed into the sunset and back and now he\u2019s Saged up. Looks at the battlefield and everyone\u2019s dead. It\u2019s him vs Madara. Madara swings his Susanoo blade and Jiraiya gets a little kiss goodnight",

Now yes I disagree that Jiraiya is the weakest Sannin, they balance each other out. People overrate Orochimaru because of the Hokages. But people forget he needs to prep to do all that.

I give him credit for off-screening the four tails while injured but that ain\u2019t a feat compared to Madara lol\nAlso he only goes Sage Mode once (in his serious fight) and that\u2019s on a mission to gather Intel. Idk if he\u2019d attempt Sage Mode if in a battle with an immediate threat like Madara. He\u2019d need to do what he did before and run away until he has gathered his team. \n\nTsunade is key as she can counter the Susanoo for a brief scuffle and regen like crazy. \nOrochimaru looked at the armored Susanoo and smiled like an evil fucker before turning into a literal hydra. This dude immediately started phasing the Susanoo and only lost so quickly because of an ethereal one-shot weapon. \nSo if anyone is gonna do what Tsunade did, it\u2019d be Orochimaru. \n\nTsunade\u2019s kinda a fuckin idiot for not using her summon to try and melt the Susanoo so maybe a different Sanin would give it a shot? Their summons don\u2019t have corrosive attacks tho. Author intent seems to lead to the idea that the main summons are generic tailed beast level without any large scale attacks (besides Tsunade\u2019s summon). \n\nSo if you wanna wank Orochimaru\u2019s large-scale-combat ability, you could say he summons his main snake (and any amount of inferior snakes) and goes full hydra for a total of 2 large threats (and any amount of smaller threats). Maybe the snakes can play biting bumper carts with Madara\u2019s clones? lmao\n\nMadara can\u2019t just slice Orochimaru and hope for a win. The dude can throw up a new body whenever he wants or stitch himself back together. Madara would need to squish him or vaporize him. \n\nBut uh, Madara can use clones of clones with Susanoo and wood style so squishing is gonna happen. \n\nOrochimaru ain\u2019t doin shit but hold back 2 of the Susanoos out of the 5 that would be summoned on him. Wank his hydra to multi Susanoo level and all he\u2019d earn is extra attention from Madara lmao\n\nIf he distracts enough maybe a particle style would actually land? Idk. \n\nAll it would take is a perfect Susanoo to stop the shenanigans though. The Kage vs Madara was like a team of Jonin going up against an S Rank ninja. \n\n\nJiraiya comes back with his Sage Mode activated. He rode his trusty toad steed into the sunset and back and now he\u2019s Saged up. Looks at the battlefield and everyone\u2019s dead. It\u2019s him vs Madara. Madara swings his Susanoo blade and Jiraiya gets a little kiss goodnight",

Kisame was scared shitless when they got trapped in the Toad intestine and Itachi had to use a Mangekyou ability just to escape the situation, that fight really could\u2019ve gone either way, but more in Jiraiya\u2019s favour since he can summon his preferred environment, basically eliminating Kisame from the equation. \n\nIt just irks me when people say he was the weakest of the Sanin or that he would have lost to newly awaken sage Naruto (not including Kuruma) when all evidence points otherwise",

I give him credit for off-screening the four tails while injured but that ain\u2019t a feat compared to Madara lol\nAlso he only goes Sage Mode once (in his serious fight) and that\u2019s on a mission to gather Intel. Idk if he\u2019d attempt Sage Mode if in a battle with an immediate threat like Madara. He\u2019d need to do what he did before and run away until he has gathered his team. \n\nTsunade is key as she can counter the Susanoo for a brief scuffle and regen like crazy. \nOrochimaru looked at the armored Susanoo and smiled like an evil fucker before turning into a literal hydra. This dude immediately started phasing the Susanoo and only lost so quickly because of an ethereal one-shot weapon. \nSo if anyone is gonna do what Tsunade did, it\u2019d be Orochimaru. \n\nTsunade\u2019s kinda a fuckin idiot for not using her summon to try and melt the Susanoo so maybe a different Sanin would give it a shot? Their summons don\u2019t have corrosive attacks tho. Author intent seems to lead to the idea that the main summons are generic tailed beast level without any large scale attacks (besides Tsunade\u2019s summon). \n\nSo if you wanna wank Orochimaru\u2019s large-scale-combat ability, you could say he summons his main snake (and any amount of inferior snakes) and goes full hydra for a total of 2 large threats (and any amount of smaller threats). Maybe the snakes can play biting bumper carts with Madara\u2019s clones? lmao\n\nMadara can\u2019t just slice Orochimaru and hope for a win. The dude can throw up a new body whenever he wants or stitch himself back together. Madara would need to squish him or vaporize him. \n\nBut uh, Madara can use clones of clones with Susanoo and wood style so squishing is gonna happen. \n\nOrochimaru ain\u2019t doin shit but hold back 2 of the Susanoos out of the 5 that would be summoned on him. Wank his hydra to multi Susanoo level and all he\u2019d earn is extra attention from Madara lmao\n\nIf he distracts enough maybe a particle style would actually land? Idk. \n\nAll it would take is a perfect Susanoo to stop the shenanigans though. The Kage vs Madara was like a team of Jonin going up against an S Rank ninja. \n\n\nJiraiya comes back with his Sage Mode activated. He rode his trusty toad steed into the sunset and back and now he\u2019s Saged up. Looks at the battlefield and everyone\u2019s dead. It\u2019s him vs Madara. Madara swings his Susanoo blade and Jiraiya gets a little kiss goodnight",

None of the edo tensei Orochimaru could summon before gaining knowledge of the perfected version would matter. \n\nUsing a hypothetical situation where they all start at 100% leads to the same outcome as well simply because no one would be able to continually recharge Ohnoki's particle style or provide enough for an enormous one that clears 25 Susano'o.",

I give him credit for off-screening the four tails while injured but that ain\u2019t a feat compared to Madara lol\nAlso he only goes Sage Mode once (in his serious fight) and that\u2019s on a mission to gather Intel. Idk if he\u2019d attempt Sage Mode if in a battle with an immediate threat like Madara. He\u2019d need to do what he did before and run away until he has gathered his team. \n\nTsunade is key as she can counter the Susanoo for a brief scuffle and regen like crazy. \nOrochimaru looked at the armored Susanoo and smiled like an evil fucker before turning into a literal hydra. This dude immediately started phasing the Susanoo and only lost so quickly because of an ethereal one-shot weapon. \nSo if anyone is gonna do what Tsunade did, it\u2019d be Orochimaru. \n\nTsunade\u2019s kinda a fuckin idiot for not using her summon to try and melt the Susanoo so maybe a different Sanin would give it a shot? Their summons don\u2019t have corrosive attacks tho. Author intent seems to lead to the idea that the main summons are generic tailed beast level without any large scale attacks (besides Tsunade\u2019s summon). \n\nSo if you wanna wank Orochimaru\u2019s large-scale-combat ability, you could say he summons his main snake (and any amount of inferior snakes) and goes full hydra for a total of 2 large threats (and any amount of smaller threats). Maybe the snakes can play biting bumper carts with Madara\u2019s clones? lmao\n\nMadara can\u2019t just slice Orochimaru and hope for a win. The dude can throw up a new body whenever he wants or stitch himself back together. Madara would need to squish him or vaporize him. \n\nBut uh, Madara can use clones of clones with Susanoo and wood style so squishing is gonna happen. \n\nOrochimaru ain\u2019t doin shit but hold back 2 of the Susanoos out of the 5 that would be summoned on him. Wank his hydra to multi Susanoo level and all he\u2019d earn is extra attention from Madara lmao\n\nIf he distracts enough maybe a particle style would actually land? Idk. \n\nAll it would take is a perfect Susanoo to stop the shenanigans though. The Kage vs Madara was like a team of Jonin going up against an S Rank ninja. \n\n\nJiraiya comes back with his Sage Mode activated. He rode his trusty toad steed into the sunset and back and now he\u2019s Saged up. Looks at the battlefield and everyone\u2019s dead. It\u2019s him vs Madara. Madara swings his Susanoo blade and Jiraiya gets a little kiss goodnight",
