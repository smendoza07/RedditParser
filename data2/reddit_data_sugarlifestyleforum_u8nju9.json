    "body": "We have had an influx of stories touting the virtues of SBs who don\u2019t want money. They are praised by \u201cSDs\u201d as being \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201chumble\u201d and how that\u2019s the ultimate way an SB can show she cares. \n\nThe comments throw shade on SBs who don\u2019t do this by implying that feelings aren\u2019t possible when money is exchanged, like those that don\u2019t turn it down are greedy or desperate. \n\nI want to just take a minute to say that this is not true. Sometimes when you hear or read a thing over and over again you start to believe it. I can tell you that I did - I certainly don\u2019t sugar from a place of need and I eventually started declining Venmo transfers and suggesting that my SBF stop supporting me. You know what he did? He said no because he cares about me and that makes him want to give to me in anyway he can. Let\u2019s be clear here: it would be a way bigger loss to my budget than gain to his to stop the support. This means the gesture is negatively impactful for me and largely only performative for his benefit. \n\nWithdrawing support of a partner in any way is not a way to show affection and care. Women sacrificing themselves and their wants/needs to prove how much they care should not be glorified. It doesn\u2019t matter if she \u201cneeds\u201d the money or not. It doesn\u2019t matter if the relationship would end if the money did. Relationships are built on mutual understanding and cooperation. If either partner is not getting their needs met, then the relationship should end so that they can each do what is best for themselves. It doesn\u2019t mean that feelings weren\u2019t real. It doesn\u2019t mean that the whole thing was a lie. It doesn\u2019t mean that either person is bad. It just stopped working. People and relationships are not that one dimensional. \n\nIf you can\u2019t trust yourself to know if someone really cares about you or not and you can\u2019t enjoy a relationship without testing your partner to satisfy your own insecurities, that is a *you* problem. \n\nPlease be aware of how this narrative that you push affects other people, particularly the young women of this community who have less experience navigating bullshit and are most susceptible to manipulation. Please stop selling the idea that to be \u201cgood\u201d a woman has to be selfless. Please consider that this entire idea is basically people entering a culture and community and then saying that those who conform to it\u2019s norms are not as good as those who have a change of heart (no matter how many times you say \u201cno judgement\u201d before you spew out loaded words and value statements).",

Then you look up a month later & how has your life improved? You got bills to pay or things you want & now you feel uncomfortable to ask him for something...Or blindly hope he takes a hint and gives you whatever he feels.\n\nThis is the definition of hustling backwards & will make you look like an immature girl to some seasoned SDs. \n\nMany could easily date regular women. They specifically search for a SB for things they're obviously not finding or valuing in the singles market. Some prefer not getting serious with someone which most women won't tolerate so money is a motivator to keep seeing them! Or they are married. \n\n\"Oh baby I like you much hehe don't help me financially\" sets up weird situations. You'll also give salt daddies hope that other SBs are cheap.\n\nAlso think about your money you spend on your appearance, gas, or whatever. In this type of relationship you should be compensated.",

I unblocked you so you should be good to do whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, at the risk of doing some super unqualified psychoanalysis shit here, it sounds like you are just really triggered by the whole money and love thing.  I don\u2019t know if someone left you or what or why you are so set on arguing with everyone that it isn\u2019t possible to have both and I find your use of the second person to describe SBs leaving SDs is the money stopped difficult to address.  I think (hope) that you mean this in a general sense because you certainly don\u2019t know me and what I would do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of this post was in part to address some of the venom you have been spewing lately - I went back and was looking at what exactly spurred this post and it was comments from you and one other person, so perhaps my use of \u201cinflux\u201d was a bit over the top as suggested, but I have seen it here over the last year quite a bit and it seemed like an increase in frequency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdmittedly, I got a little heated and fired this off, for better or worse.Again, I know this is pointless with someone committed to misunderstanding and generating more conflict which is the impression I am getting from your interactions, but perhaps it\u2019s just a case of hurt people hurting people\u2026 that said, I want to clarify a couple things but know I have no intention of engaging with you any more.\n\n1. I say \u201csupport\u201d instead of money for a couple reasons.  Primarily because dating is not a job.  This isn\u2019t my paycheck.  The money that my partner shares with me is not to buy me or pay for my time or bribe me.  It\u2019s a way he makes my life easier - just like when he installed my new fancy pants door lock and got my car detailed.  He has a greater abundance of funds than I do and in a healthy relationship you share resources, especially if it does not create an undue burden on the partner doing the sharing and is positively impactful for the partner on the receiving end.\n2. The whole issue with the argument that no money = no relationship therefore the feelings can\u2019t be real is that there are lots of dealbreakers when a relationship changes.  If my partner unilaterally decided to stop providing emotional support, I would leave, wouldn\u2019t you?  Ending a relationship because the terms changed doesn\u2019t make the relationship and any feelings that developed not real.  If that were the case, then any relationship that ends would fall into that category and that\u2019s just simply not true.  Further, the argument that it means she loved the money more than the man also falls flat - it\u2019s a whole package.  Money makes lots of things easier but I think most people would agree that it\u2019s rarely the ONLY consideration and it\u2019s never been my personal primary concern.  If money were taken our of my SR, I\u2019m not sure what I would do because it depends why that happened.  Proving my love was not the reason I actually suggested it to my SBF but had that been the pressure, I suspect the relationship would have been short-lived afterwards because the requirement to make some sort of self-sacrificing gesture indicates an underlying mistrust of me that I do think makes love untenable.  And had he agreed, there is probably a chance that I would have ended up resenting the added financial stress knowing that he had the ability to alleviate it but didn\u2019t care to.\n   1. To be clear, I don\u2019t mean self-sacrificing terms of I can no longer afford food.  I mean self sacrificing in detrimental to me because it adds stress, reduces my resources, whatever.  If a sacrifice is needed for the benefit of the partnership, that is one thing, if just on the altar of my partner\u2019s ego, that\u2019s another thing entirely.\n3. The point of this post was not actually to argue for or against financial support in whatever form two people agree on.  I think they should do whatever makes them happy and it\u2019s honestly none of my business.  If a woman decides on her own that she doesn\u2019t want money because she developed feelings, that\u2019s fine (though I still think a thoughtful partner might investigate that and what the point is, but that\u2019s true of any issue that comes up in a relationship).  My point was that the language we use to describe these situations elevates the women who decline and denigrates those who do not and that this has the effect of indirectly pressuring the most vulnerable populations to make decisions/gesture that are not in their self interest on the chance that it will be a net positive or to prove their virtue to their partner which is only necessary in the event that their partner has insecurities that would be more effectively and healthily addressed on their own rather than through the actions of others.  Examples of the kind of language I mean:\n   1. **Some women are just genuine people** and she wanted to show him kindness, plus not all SB do this for a living where they\u2019re in dire need...It\u2019s a nice story to show SD that **not all women on SA are money hungry and just out for themselves** and there are still some gems to be found on SA. I know If I ended up in a sugar relationship with this women, **more then likely she would be spoiled a lot more in the long run** than a woman that had her hand out asking for money for this date.\n   2. Our whole interaction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/u7l3y2/comment/i5fk2o1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nI know, I know, too many words again and very little nuance will get through, but I just can\u2019t seem to keep from arguing for circumspection and care anyway. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Hell, I just held in \u201cI love you\u201d a couple times during the sexytimes yesterday. \n\nBut - the most truly caring, thoughtful men I\u2019ve encountered have insisted on spoiling me anyway. Because it\u2019s really not much to them, and it moves my life from \u201cfinancially quite solid but pay a lot of attention to my budget\u201d to \u201creduced stress, I can upgrade household items when they get old without thinking about it, not feel bad for taking an Uber when it\u2019s a little yucky out, and overall be a happier and more relaxed person\u201d. \n\nIt makes me feel feminine, and grateful, and taken care of - which are all things he ends up benefitting from too \ud83d\ude09 And any guy I\u2019m gonna be romantically compatible with is old worldy in the same way and enjoys making me feel that way.\n\nETA: I have also come across people who are simply not generous and dress it up as \u201cI\u2019m afraid the money will ruin it/make you feel manipulated\u201d or some BS like that. Those were **the only** relationships I\u2019ve been in where the money did actually feel manipulative. If I know I\u2019ll be taken care of; peace of mind, zero feeling manipulated. If I\u2019m constantly wondering \u201cdoes this count as something I should ask for help with?\u201d, \u201cif I bring this concern to him will he feel less generous next week?\u201d, etc *then* it feels manipulative.",

While I will certainly celebrate this in the moment, because of the expression from my SB, I and no way will allow that behavior to continue unchecked.\n\nMy second sr was so stubborn in this regard that it eventually became a turn off and led to us parting ways.  Yes, I had my stubbornness as well and learned a lot from her.  Its funny, we still talk and Ive actually fired off funding for her after things ended because she told me she needed it in a round about way, and it made me feel good.",

You should not have to ASK your man to help you every time you want something, he should just keep things the way they are so that you DON'T have to ask. Why would you start a sugar relationship and then when you are in love, STOP the sugar relationship and begin a totally different type of relationship?",

How do we know this? One example reason: Because there are SR's that later turn into vanilla relationships, with no allowance.

I never paid an allowance to my current SB/SGF because that was not what she needed.  I invested more than an allowance worth when she needed that and it morphed when she needed it to change.  You are welcome to your opinion but you don\u2019t get to define Salt Daddy as someone with a different arrangement.\n\nI have also had a traditional allowance SR with a different SB.  That doesn\u2019t make me more or less of a SD\u2026. Just different needs of the SB.\n\nAs for you being real, I don\u2019t really know (or care).  I just disagree with you and your attempt to slander people because we disagree.  \n\nPerhaps the term Splenda is more what you are attempting to label SDs that don\u2019t fit YOUR opinion.\n\nThe reality is there are many configurations of SR and as long as both sides are consensually engaging in it then it doesn\u2019t matter if you and I approve.",

Perhaps you have some massive white knight/savior complex going on.  I agree all parties should act ethnically but that is a much larger can of worms to unpack.  I get to have a clear conscious on all fronts because I am divorced and my arrangements have been mutually agreed to and adapted to changing situations.\n\nPerhaps you can organize a union and do training classes for newbie SBs if that makes you feel good.  Hell TikTok is full of shitty women espousing garbage about how to con men etc\u2026.  The bottom line is people should define their wants/needs, speak them, and associate with people whom support those wants/needs.  If a situation isn\u2019t working for you, move on.

I saw a post yesterday about someone going through emotionally tough time (mother's health?) and emotional support he got from his SB. He offered to pay and she refused. He posted a message here of gratitude and in the end i believe ended up giving the SB sizable cash?   \nThis morning I see this post which seems to criticize any one expressing gratitude. I feel that the OP in this post is projecting. Anyway, that is my opinion. Yours seem to be different about the post, and also you think that I am intentionally misunderstanding stuff.   \nAt this point, it is just best to stop discussing, because this kind of discussion is in bad faith",

                    "body": "My bad.  I didn\u2019t feel like tilting at your particular windmill and didn\u2019t realize it would mean you could no longer engage on this thread.  I unblocked you so you should be good to do whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, at the risk of doing some super unqualified psychoanalysis shit here, it sounds like you are just really triggered by the whole money and love thing.  I don\u2019t know if someone left you or what or why you are so set on arguing with everyone that it isn\u2019t possible to have both and I find your use of the second person to describe SBs leaving SDs is the money stopped difficult to address.  I think (hope) that you mean this in a general sense because you certainly don\u2019t know me and what I would do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of this post was in part to address some of the venom you have been spewing lately - I went back and was looking at what exactly spurred this post and it was comments from you and one other person, so perhaps my use of \u201cinflux\u201d was a bit over the top as suggested, but I have seen it here over the last year quite a bit and it seemed like an increase in frequency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdmittedly, I got a little heated and fired this off, for better or worse.Again, I know this is pointless with someone committed to misunderstanding and generating more conflict which is the impression I am getting from your interactions, but perhaps it\u2019s just a case of hurt people hurting people\u2026 that said, I want to clarify a couple things but know I have no intention of engaging with you any more.\n\n1. I say \u201csupport\u201d instead of money for a couple reasons.  Primarily because dating is not a job.  This isn\u2019t my paycheck.  The money that my partner shares with me is not to buy me or pay for my time or bribe me.  It\u2019s a way he makes my life easier - just like when he installed my new fancy pants door lock and got my car detailed.  He has a greater abundance of funds than I do and in a healthy relationship you share resources, especially if it does not create an undue burden on the partner doing the sharing and is positively impactful for the partner on the receiving end.\n2. The whole issue with the argument that no money = no relationship therefore the feelings can\u2019t be real is that there are lots of dealbreakers when a relationship changes.  If my partner unilaterally decided to stop providing emotional support, I would leave, wouldn\u2019t you?  Ending a relationship because the terms changed doesn\u2019t make the relationship and any feelings that developed not real.  If that were the case, then any relationship that ends would fall into that category and that\u2019s just simply not true.  Further, the argument that it means she loved the money more than the man also falls flat - it\u2019s a whole package.  Money makes lots of things easier but I think most people would agree that it\u2019s rarely the ONLY consideration and it\u2019s never been my personal primary concern.  If money were taken our of my SR, I\u2019m not sure what I would do because it depends why that happened.  Proving my love was not the reason I actually suggested it to my SBF but had that been the pressure, I suspect the relationship would have been short-lived afterwards because the requirement to make some sort of self-sacrificing gesture indicates an underlying mistrust of me that I do think makes love untenable.  And had he agreed, there is probably a chance that I would have ended up resenting the added financial stress knowing that he had the ability to alleviate it but didn\u2019t care to.\n   1. To be clear, I don\u2019t mean self-sacrificing terms of I can no longer afford food.  I mean self sacrificing in detrimental to me because it adds stress, reduces my resources, whatever.  If a sacrifice is needed for the benefit of the partnership, that is one thing, if just on the altar of my partner\u2019s ego, that\u2019s another thing entirely.\n3. The point of this post was not actually to argue for or against financial support in whatever form two people agree on.  I think they should do whatever makes them happy and it\u2019s honestly none of my business.  If a woman decides on her own that she doesn\u2019t want money because she developed feelings, that\u2019s fine (though I still think a thoughtful partner might investigate that and what the point is, but that\u2019s true of any issue that comes up in a relationship).  My point was that the language we use to describe these situations elevates the women who decline and denigrates those who do not and that this has the effect of indirectly pressuring the most vulnerable populations to make decisions/gesture that are not in their self interest on the chance that it will be a net positive or to prove their virtue to their partner which is only necessary in the event that their partner has insecurities that would be more effectively and healthily addressed on their own rather than through the actions of others.  Examples of the kind of language I mean:\n   1. **Some women are just genuine people** and she wanted to show him kindness, plus not all SB do this for a living where they\u2019re in dire need...It\u2019s a nice story to show SD that **not all women on SA are money hungry and just out for themselves** and there are still some gems to be found on SA. I know If I ended up in a sugar relationship with this women, **more then likely she would be spoiled a lot more in the long run** than a woman that had her hand out asking for money for this date.\n   2. Our whole interaction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/u7l3y2/comment/i5fk2o1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nI know, I know, too many words again and very little nuance will get through, but I just can\u2019t seem to keep from arguing for circumspection and care anyway. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

This goes back to \u201call dating is sugar dating when you are fairly wealthy.\u201d\n\nOver the years I have helped several SB\u2019s get into situations where they were making great money and said they no longer needed allowance.  At first I thought that was great but the relationships slowly faded.   My current SB of nearly 3 years is now in the same situation.  I mentored her through the process of buying a business and she is making great money,  more than she ever imagined.  She said she felt like putting her in that position was like an allowance.  I disagreed as she still works her ass off and deals with business owner stress. After a talk about it I convinced her to just accept my allowance and gifts.  She admitted she feels really loved and cared for.  Both of her parents have addiction issues and neglected her throughout her childhood.  She says the attention and affection and support is what makes her feel loved.  She has never gotten that elsewhere. \n\n I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to turn down gifts or allowance but we don\u2019t want to feel like an ATM in every situation.  My girl is buying her dream car this morning (4Runner TRD) and she refused any financial help or for me to go the dealership with her.  She wants to do this on her own and I\u2019m proud of her.",

I never paid an allowance to my current SB/SGF because that was not what she needed.  I invested more than an allowance worth when she needed that and it morphed when she needed it to change.  You are welcome to your opinion but you don\u2019t get to define Salt Daddy as someone with a different arrangement.\n\nI have also had a traditional allowance SR with a different SB.  That doesn\u2019t make me more or less of a SD\u2026. Just different needs of the SB.\n\nAs for you being real, I don\u2019t really know (or care).  I just disagree with you and your attempt to slander people because we disagree.  \n\nPerhaps the term Splenda is more what you are attempting to label SDs that don\u2019t fit YOUR opinion.\n\nThe reality is there are many configurations of SR and as long as both sides are consensually engaging in it then it doesn\u2019t matter if you and I approve.",

Perhaps you have some massive white knight/savior complex going on.  I agree all parties should act ethnically but that is a much larger can of worms to unpack.  I get to have a clear conscious on all fronts because I am divorced and my arrangements have been mutually agreed to and adapted to changing situations.\n\nPerhaps you can organize a union and do training classes for newbie SBs if that makes you feel good.  Hell TikTok is full of shitty women espousing garbage about how to con men etc\u2026.  The bottom line is people should define their wants/needs, speak them, and associate with people whom support those wants/needs.  If a situation isn\u2019t working for you, move on.

I saw a post yesterday about someone going through emotionally tough time (mother's health?) and emotional support he got from his SB. He offered to pay and she refused. He posted a message here of gratitude and in the end i believe ended up giving the SB sizable cash?   \nThis morning I see this post which seems to criticize any one expressing gratitude. I feel that the OP in this post is projecting. Anyway, that is my opinion. Yours seem to be different about the post, and also you think that I am intentionally misunderstanding stuff.   \nAt this point, it is just best to stop discussing, because this kind of discussion is in bad faith",

I unblocked you so you should be good to do whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, at the risk of doing some super unqualified psychoanalysis shit here, it sounds like you are just really triggered by the whole money and love thing.  I don\u2019t know if someone left you or what or why you are so set on arguing with everyone that it isn\u2019t possible to have both and I find your use of the second person to describe SBs leaving SDs is the money stopped difficult to address.  I think (hope) that you mean this in a general sense because you certainly don\u2019t know me and what I would do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of this post was in part to address some of the venom you have been spewing lately - I went back and was looking at what exactly spurred this post and it was comments from you and one other person, so perhaps my use of \u201cinflux\u201d was a bit over the top as suggested, but I have seen it here over the last year quite a bit and it seemed like an increase in frequency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdmittedly, I got a little heated and fired this off, for better or worse.Again, I know this is pointless with someone committed to misunderstanding and generating more conflict which is the impression I am getting from your interactions, but perhaps it\u2019s just a case of hurt people hurting people\u2026 that said, I want to clarify a couple things but know I have no intention of engaging with you any more.\n\n1. I say \u201csupport\u201d instead of money for a couple reasons.  Primarily because dating is not a job.  This isn\u2019t my paycheck.  The money that my partner shares with me is not to buy me or pay for my time or bribe me.  It\u2019s a way he makes my life easier - just like when he installed my new fancy pants door lock and got my car detailed.  He has a greater abundance of funds than I do and in a healthy relationship you share resources, especially if it does not create an undue burden on the partner doing the sharing and is positively impactful for the partner on the receiving end.\n2. The whole issue with the argument that no money = no relationship therefore the feelings can\u2019t be real is that there are lots of dealbreakers when a relationship changes.  If my partner unilaterally decided to stop providing emotional support, I would leave, wouldn\u2019t you?  Ending a relationship because the terms changed doesn\u2019t make the relationship and any feelings that developed not real.  If that were the case, then any relationship that ends would fall into that category and that\u2019s just simply not true.  Further, the argument that it means she loved the money more than the man also falls flat - it\u2019s a whole package.  Money makes lots of things easier but I think most people would agree that it\u2019s rarely the ONLY consideration and it\u2019s never been my personal primary concern.  If money were taken our of my SR, I\u2019m not sure what I would do because it depends why that happened.  Proving my love was not the reason I actually suggested it to my SBF but had that been the pressure, I suspect the relationship would have been short-lived afterwards because the requirement to make some sort of self-sacrificing gesture indicates an underlying mistrust of me that I do think makes love untenable.  And had he agreed, there is probably a chance that I would have ended up resenting the added financial stress knowing that he had the ability to alleviate it but didn\u2019t care to.\n   1. To be clear, I don\u2019t mean self-sacrificing terms of I can no longer afford food.  I mean self sacrificing in detrimental to me because it adds stress, reduces my resources, whatever.  If a sacrifice is needed for the benefit of the partnership, that is one thing, if just on the altar of my partner\u2019s ego, that\u2019s another thing entirely.\n3. The point of this post was not actually to argue for or against financial support in whatever form two people agree on.  I think they should do whatever makes them happy and it\u2019s honestly none of my business.  If a woman decides on her own that she doesn\u2019t want money because she developed feelings, that\u2019s fine (though I still think a thoughtful partner might investigate that and what the point is, but that\u2019s true of any issue that comes up in a relationship).  My point was that the language we use to describe these situations elevates the women who decline and denigrates those who do not and that this has the effect of indirectly pressuring the most vulnerable populations to make decisions/gesture that are not in their self interest on the chance that it will be a net positive or to prove their virtue to their partner which is only necessary in the event that their partner has insecurities that would be more effectively and healthily addressed on their own rather than through the actions of others.  Examples of the kind of language I mean:\n   1. **Some women are just genuine people** and she wanted to show him kindness, plus not all SB do this for a living where they\u2019re in dire need...It\u2019s a nice story to show SD that **not all women on SA are money hungry and just out for themselves** and there are still some gems to be found on SA. I know If I ended up in a sugar relationship with this women, **more then likely she would be spoiled a lot more in the long run** than a woman that had her hand out asking for money for this date.\n   2. Our whole interaction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/u7l3y2/comment/i5fk2o1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nI know, I know, too many words again and very little nuance will get through, but I just can\u2019t seem to keep from arguing for circumspection and care anyway. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

A SD pushing to remove allowance from an arrangement is another thing entirely, but that was neither the topic of the OP or my reply.\n\nBut to answer your question, since I am single and start my arrangements with a weekly allowance I have neither of those issues in my arrangements.",

They get bashed by NSA only SDs where sex is the primary component for their arrangements, SDs that value an actual relationship are comfortable with occasional platonic dates because the connection with the SB is what is most important to us.\n\nJust asking for a bit of parity here, if SDs can be praised for platonic dates then SBs can certainly be praised for unpaid dates.",

Now we\u2019re basically vanilla dating on track to something even longer.  She choose to drop to vanilla because she wanted to spend a year financially fully on her own now that she has a career based on the education I helped with.  \n\nI now cover all of the extras in life like travel, optional clothing, generally make life nicer.  We just went to London, Flagship First Class, so I am pretty sure I\u2019m not a \u201csalt daddy\u201d.\n\nOn another front you\u2019ve managed to pretty well convince more than a few seasoned observers you are not as you present yourself.  I can\u2019t speak to that but if that is true that\u2019s pretty pathetic.\n\nSome of us have a very long and consistent post history and can be verified.

You are welcome to your opinion but you don\u2019t get to define Salt Daddy as someone with a different arrangement.\n\nI have also had a traditional allowance SR with a different SB.  That doesn\u2019t make me more or less of a SD\u2026. Just different needs of the SB.\n\nAs for you being real, I don\u2019t really know (or care).  I just disagree with you and your attempt to slander people because we disagree.  \n\nPerhaps the term Splenda is more what you are attempting to label SDs that don\u2019t fit YOUR opinion.\n\nThe reality is there are many configurations of SR and as long as both sides are consensually engaging in it then it doesn\u2019t matter if you and I approve.",

Perhaps you have some massive white knight/savior complex going on.  I agree all parties should act ethnically but that is a much larger can of worms to unpack.  I get to have a clear conscious on all fronts because I am divorced and my arrangements have been mutually agreed to and adapted to changing situations.\n\nPerhaps you can organize a union and do training classes for newbie SBs if that makes you feel good.  Hell TikTok is full of shitty women espousing garbage about how to con men etc\u2026.  The bottom line is people should define their wants/needs, speak them, and associate with people whom support those wants/needs.  If a situation isn\u2019t working for you, move on.

I just disagree with you and your attempt to slander people because we disagree.  \n\nPerhaps the term Splenda is more what you are attempting to label SDs that don\u2019t fit YOUR opinion.\n\nThe reality is there are many configurations of SR and as long as both sides are consensually engaging in it then it doesn\u2019t matter if you and I approve.",

You want to try to setup boundaries that you define well I reject the desire to create a one size fits all definition.  There is no reason a woman can not be allowed to change her mind about what she wants and ask for something new.  Same thing for the man.  Perhaps you have some massive white knight/savior complex going on.  I agree all parties should act ethnically but that is a much larger can of worms to unpack.  I get to have a clear conscious on all fronts because I am divorced and my arrangements have been mutually agreed to and adapted to changing situations.\n\nPerhaps you can organize a union and do training classes for newbie SBs if that makes you feel good.  Hell TikTok is full of shitty women espousing garbage about how to con men etc\u2026.  The bottom line is people should define their wants/needs, speak them, and associate with people whom support those wants/needs.  If a situation isn\u2019t working for you, move on.

I invested more than an allowance worth when she needed that and it morphed when she needed it to change.  You are welcome to your opinion but you don\u2019t get to define Salt Daddy as someone with a different arrangement.\n\nI have also had a traditional allowance SR with a different SB.  That doesn\u2019t make me more or less of a SD\u2026. Just different needs of the SB.\n\nAs for you being real, I don\u2019t really know (or care).  I just disagree with you and your attempt to slander people because we disagree.  \n\nPerhaps the term Splenda is more what you are attempting to label SDs that don\u2019t fit YOUR opinion.\n\nThe reality is there are many configurations of SR and as long as both sides are consensually engaging in it then it doesn\u2019t matter if you and I approve.",

You want to try to setup boundaries that you define well I reject the desire to create a one size fits all definition.

Perhaps you have some massive white knight/savior complex going on.  I agree all parties should act ethnically but that is a much larger can of worms to unpack.  I get to have a clear conscious on all fronts because I am divorced and my arrangements have been mutually agreed to and adapted to changing situations.\n\nPerhaps you can organize a union and do training classes for newbie SBs if that makes you feel good.  Hell TikTok is full of shitty women espousing garbage about how to con men etc\u2026.  The bottom line is people should define their wants/needs, speak them, and associate with people whom support those wants/needs.  If a situation isn\u2019t working for you, move on.

And I don\u2019t really care whether you got a closer down votes are left go to right vote who gives a shit you\u2019re expressing your opinion you\u2019re not Websters and this is not the dictionary hell this isn\u2019t even Wikipedia. You\u2019re just another blind username spouting your opinion just like I\u2019m doing mine",
