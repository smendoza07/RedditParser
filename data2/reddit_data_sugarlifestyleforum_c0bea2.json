    "body": "I hate \"complaining\" and I'm really not but do any other SBs get a surge of rage when they read this on younger SDs profiles?

They are no longer in school, and possible dont want to date in the company pool, and they have tried tinder, and have either met guys that want to go dutch, or met guys only looking for NSA/FWB/one nighters. I've met quite a few women on Seeking, that had their shit together, and were just looking to date a better caliber of guy. Many of these women just wanted someone a little older, more established, and that treated them like gold, without an allowance.",

Fact is most women are unable to land good vanillas and then they latch on to sugar and get addicted to the sugar life, so much so that they wake up one day and cannot accept any guy who is willing to date them without a financial component.",

Americans (at least the boys) seem to have much higher allowances and seem to tend towards platonic arrangements. I can see why there would be less of a demand for that kind of thing.",

They are no longer in school, and possible dont want to date in the company pool, and they have tried tinder, and have either met guys that want to go dutch, or met guys only looking for NSA/FWB/one nighters. I've met quite a few women on Seeking, that had their shit together, and were just looking to date a better caliber of guy. Many of these women just wanted someone a little older, more established, and that treated them like gold, without an allowance.",

Americans (at least the boys) seem to have much higher allowances and seem to tend towards platonic arrangements. I can see why there would be less of a demand for that kind of thing.",

I\u2019m by no means a regular but I have had a sugar daddy before, and both on sites like Seeking and the apps (Grindr mostly), there is a healthy stock of SD\u2019s who are offering, and knowing a few other gays, there seems to be a decent supply of boys willing to take them up as well.\n\nWe need to pay for our lives just the same way girls need to pay for theirs, and trust me, there are more than enough wealthy older men who led closeted lives when they were younger and want to make up for that to go round.\n\nThis could be a British thing, however. Americans (at least the boys) seem to have much higher allowances and seem to tend towards platonic arrangements. I can see why there would be less of a demand for that kind of thing.",

Americans (at least the boys) seem to have much higher allowances and seem to tend towards platonic arrangements. I can see why there would be less of a demand for that kind of thing.",

I\u2019m by no means a regular but I have had a sugar daddy before, and both on sites like Seeking and the apps (Grindr mostly), there is a healthy stock of SD\u2019s who are offering, and knowing a few other gays, there seems to be a decent supply of boys willing to take them up as well.\n\nWe need to pay for our lives just the same way girls need to pay for theirs, and trust me, there are more than enough wealthy older men who led closeted lives when they were younger and want to make up for that to go round.\n\nThis could be a British thing, however. Americans (at least the boys) seem to have much higher allowances and seem to tend towards platonic arrangements. I can see why there would be less of a demand for that kind of thing.",
