The main problem was a real lack of narrative or stakes on why exactly people wanted or needed to become Chuunin and what they\u2019d do if they did, or perhaps people there with reasons other than becoming Chuunin. \n\nInstead, we got a pretty weak arc on why cheating is bad and that you need to train your powers, which is pretty tone deaf coming from people who, although they put in some work, inherited a lot of their powers, and theres no hint that anyone recognizes their hypocrisy. Boruto getting off with basically a slap on the wrist with no lasting consequences was also pretty dumb. It is one of the weakest arcs in the series and could have been much better. Far preferred the Shin arc and the Ghost arc, so there is some criticism to be had.",

And it's story is kinda weak, but it is for kids, but it get most of it's points through different aspects. Like the pacing, it's like 1 filler than 2 episodes of story, and the filler will sometimes start you on the path toward story. In both the og Naruto, and shippuden, the pacing felt so slow. And the kaguya battle was torture, but I wanted to get the full story. It was like 2-4 episodes of filler than battle. And that's where boruto gets most of it's points, and all in all, it is an enjoyable show. If it wasn't, Naruto fans probably wouldn't watch it because it was so bad.",

I'm assuming that at most, the very large clans could field 1000 combatants at a time. I'd be surprised if a single battle during the clan wars involved more than 5k combatants. Warfare during that era was probably more frequent, but low-intensity, sort of like historical tribal warfare between honor cultures.\n\n\nGoing off the real world history of China and Japan, who had periods of warfare called the \"era of warring states\", Kishimoto has his history backwards. The era of warring states was the period when powerful centralized states waged war against each other. This was long past the era of low-intensity clan warfare.",

World peace just means the nations will no longer turn on each other and there will never be a \u201cnext wartime\u201d. This does not mean the end of all conflict. They can still write more conflict using rogue shinobi, aliens, etc. without changing the definition of world peace. And they\u2019ve done that.\n\n\n>sometimes it's best to stick with what you've established or just end the story for good.\n\nThey have stuck with world peace. That\u2019s why the chuunin exams aren\u2019t as harsh anymore. There is no reason for it to remain a death match when there will be no more wars. The average ninja doesn\u2019t need to be trained to deal with Otsutski aliens, they need to be trained to deal with rogue ninja and other criminals. Before they were trained to be child soldiers for war but there\u2019s no reason to keep the chuunin exams that way anymore.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to follow Boruto if you don\u2019t want to.

I don't know when people are gonna let that go. It's made very clear early on that the anime wants to take a casual route. Could it be better? Absolutely.

I,was excited for more after seeing the Boruto movie but aside from a few moments here and there and the expansion of the chunin exams on the anime it\u2019s just been a disappointment that I eventually just couldn\u2019t soldier through anymore. I want to read the manga but Ikemoto\u2019s art is fucking awful and he draws every 12 year old (especially Sarada) like a stripper. So I\u2019m waiting for the anime to adapt it.    \n    \nMy problem has never been the tone I love the idea of exploring the world post peace and what a ninja world bred on war and child soldiers would be like during peace and the problems that can still arise from it. But the anime just wastes anything they try. The Hidden Mist village field trip arc is the best example of wasted potential. And if they just wanted it to be SoL that\u2019d be fine but they still want stakes and tension but there\u2019s barely any of it because they never try to make it to hard or difficult (at least from the first 100 episodes I watched). They should\u2019ve just made it a seasonal anime so they could\u2019ve at least spent more time on it and had better writing. And actually explored the stories they wanted to try to the fullest.   \n    \nThere\u2019s so much that could\u2019ve been done with Boruto but it\u2019s mostly half assed shit and even with Kishimoto fully taking over the writing of manga I don\u2019t know if he can salvage it completely. The anime is mostly filler (not like non-canon filler just fluff filler). It\u2019s good here and there but honestly the most enjoyment I\u2019ve gotten has been any of the old characters focus or like the Mirai hot spring arc from the novels. And while I do also like half the new generation the other half is so goddamn forgettable to worthless garbage like fucking Denki. Or again, they\u2019re wasted potential like Hanabi\u2019s squad.   \n   \nJust to wrap this long-winded shit up, Boruto hasn\u2019t ruined Naruto or anything, we all still have the old series. I\u2019m just sad it didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential. And honestly it didn\u2019t need to be the same tone to not being fucking babied down the way it has when it comes to some of the violence. Ah well.",

I brought up the fact that Boruto is more competent, as to disprove your point as to how he and his generation are light-hearted. Are they light-hearted compared to Naruto's generation? Of course they are, but Naruto's generation was not normal(i.e. war time, and literal fucking child soldiers).\n\nAs for capture the flag. Listen bro, I'm not going to say you're stupid or anything, so please don't take it that way. But can you REALLY not see as to how capture the flag could have real life applications in the Ninja world? Replace the flag for enemy intel, or even a rogue ninja you have to capture.\n\nI'm gonna repeat myself again but fuck it, I've already gone this far. There's no need for life or death tests anymore to test or improve the skills of literal children(that's what they are.) Capture the flag is more than adequate enough to test them. Could the tests be more serious and grave? Yes, I'd be willing to give you that but I can make that argument for nearly everything.\n\nI don't know what country you're from, but the world we live in as of right now is the most peaceful it has ever been. That doesn't mean we should literally always think of what the next worst case scenario could be and start training nearly everyone to be \"as powerful as they can\", in your own words.

Their is still need for  life and or death test at times for without death or near death situations it will most likely produce lite hearted people. As explained in a kakashi novel (cannon btw) a country was gonna go to war with the land of fire since the fact that the land of fire currently have a huge amount of lite hearted and softened shinobi (due to them being in peace for a long time)gave them a reason and opening to try and invade. Situations like these make it be necessary for more in death situations for it provides less lite hearted shinobi and prevents openings like these.

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense).

And it's story is kinda weak, but it is for kids, but it get most of it's points through different aspects. Like the pacing, it's like 1 filler than 2 episodes of story, and the filler will sometimes start you on the path toward story. In both the og Naruto, and shippuden, the pacing felt so slow. And the kaguya battle was torture, but I wanted to get the full story. It was like 2-4 episodes of filler than battle. And that's where boruto gets most of it's points, and all in all, it is an enjoyable show. If it wasn't, Naruto fans probably wouldn't watch it because it was so bad.",

I'm assuming that at most, the very large clans could field 1000 combatants at a time. I'd be surprised if a single battle during the clan wars involved more than 5k combatants. Warfare during that era was probably more frequent, but low-intensity, sort of like historical tribal warfare between honor cultures.\n\n\nGoing off the real world history of China and Japan, who had periods of warfare called the \"era of warring states\", Kishimoto has his history backwards. The era of warring states was the period when powerful centralized states waged war against each other. This was long past the era of low-intensity clan warfare.",

World peace just means the nations will no longer turn on each other and there will never be a \u201cnext wartime\u201d. This does not mean the end of all conflict. They can still write more conflict using rogue shinobi, aliens, etc. without changing the definition of world peace. And they\u2019ve done that.\n\n\n>sometimes it's best to stick with what you've established or just end the story for good.\n\nThey have stuck with world peace. That\u2019s why the chuunin exams aren\u2019t as harsh anymore. There is no reason for it to remain a death match when there will be no more wars. The average ninja doesn\u2019t need to be trained to deal with Otsutski aliens, they need to be trained to deal with rogue ninja and other criminals. Before they were trained to be child soldiers for war but there\u2019s no reason to keep the chuunin exams that way anymore.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to follow Boruto if you don\u2019t want to.

I,was excited for more after seeing the Boruto movie but aside from a few moments here and there and the expansion of the chunin exams on the anime it\u2019s just been a disappointment that I eventually just couldn\u2019t soldier through anymore. I want to read the manga but Ikemoto\u2019s art is fucking awful and he draws every 12 year old (especially Sarada) like a stripper. So I\u2019m waiting for the anime to adapt it.    \n    \nMy problem has never been the tone I love the idea of exploring the world post peace and what a ninja world bred on war and child soldiers would be like during peace and the problems that can still arise from it. But the anime just wastes anything they try. The Hidden Mist village field trip arc is the best example of wasted potential. And if they just wanted it to be SoL that\u2019d be fine but they still want stakes and tension but there\u2019s barely any of it because they never try to make it to hard or difficult (at least from the first 100 episodes I watched). They should\u2019ve just made it a seasonal anime so they could\u2019ve at least spent more time on it and had better writing. And actually explored the stories they wanted to try to the fullest.   \n    \nThere\u2019s so much that could\u2019ve been done with Boruto but it\u2019s mostly half assed shit and even with Kishimoto fully taking over the writing of manga I don\u2019t know if he can salvage it completely. The anime is mostly filler (not like non-canon filler just fluff filler). It\u2019s good here and there but honestly the most enjoyment I\u2019ve gotten has been any of the old characters focus or like the Mirai hot spring arc from the novels. And while I do also like half the new generation the other half is so goddamn forgettable to worthless garbage like fucking Denki. Or again, they\u2019re wasted potential like Hanabi\u2019s squad.   \n   \nJust to wrap this long-winded shit up, Boruto hasn\u2019t ruined Naruto or anything, we all still have the old series. I\u2019m just sad it didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential. And honestly it didn\u2019t need to be the same tone to not being fucking babied down the way it has when it comes to some of the violence. Ah well.",

Listen bro, I'm not going to say you're stupid or anything, so please don't take it that way. But can you REALLY not see as to how capture the flag could have real life applications in the Ninja world? Replace the flag for enemy intel, or even a rogue ninja you have to capture.\n\nI'm gonna repeat myself again but fuck it, I've already gone this far. There's no need for life or death tests anymore to test or improve the skills of literal children(that's what they are.) Capture the flag is more than adequate enough to test them. Could the tests be more serious and grave? Yes, I'd be willing to give you that but I can make that argument for nearly everything.\n\nI don't know what country you're from, but the world we live in as of right now is the most peaceful it has ever been.

Their is still need for  life and or death test at times for without death or near death situations it will most likely produce lite hearted people. As explained in a kakashi novel (cannon btw) a country was gonna go to war with the land of fire since the fact that the land of fire currently have a huge amount of lite hearted and softened shinobi (due to them being in peace for a long time)gave them a reason and opening to try and invade. Situations like these make it be necessary for more in death situations for it provides less lite hearted shinobi and prevents openings like these.

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense). Btw English isn't my first language and thx for being thoughtful.",

And it's story is kinda weak, but it is for kids, but it get most of it's points through different aspects. Like the pacing, it's like 1 filler than 2 episodes of story, and the filler will sometimes start you on the path toward story. In both the og Naruto, and shippuden, the pacing felt so slow. And the kaguya battle was torture, but I wanted to get the full story. It was like 2-4 episodes of filler than battle. And that's where boruto gets most of it's points, and all in all, it is an enjoyable show. If it wasn't, Naruto fans probably wouldn't watch it because it was so bad.",

I'm assuming that at most, the very large clans could field 1000 combatants at a time. I'd be surprised if a single battle during the clan wars involved more than 5k combatants. Warfare during that era was probably more frequent, but low-intensity, sort of like historical tribal warfare between honor cultures.\n\n\nGoing off the real world history of China and Japan, who had periods of warfare called the \"era of warring states\", Kishimoto has his history backwards. The era of warring states was the period when powerful centralized states waged war against each other. This was long past the era of low-intensity clan warfare.",

World peace just means the nations will no longer turn on each other and there will never be a \u201cnext wartime\u201d. This does not mean the end of all conflict. They can still write more conflict using rogue shinobi, aliens, etc. without changing the definition of world peace.

That\u2019s why the chuunin exams aren\u2019t as harsh anymore. There is no reason for it to remain a death match when there will be no more wars. The average ninja doesn\u2019t need to be trained to deal with Otsutski aliens, they need to be trained to deal with rogue ninja and other criminals. Before they were trained to be child soldiers for war but there\u2019s no reason to keep the chuunin exams that way anymore.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to follow Boruto if you don\u2019t want to.

I,was excited for more after seeing the Boruto movie but aside from a few moments here and there and the expansion of the chunin exams on the anime it\u2019s just been a disappointment that I eventually just couldn\u2019t soldier through anymore. I want to read the manga but Ikemoto\u2019s art is fucking awful and he draws every 12 year old (especially Sarada) like a stripper. So I\u2019m waiting for the anime to adapt it.    \n    \nMy problem has never been the tone I love the idea of exploring the world post peace and what a ninja world bred on war and child soldiers would be like during peace and the problems that can still arise from it. But the anime just wastes anything they try. The Hidden Mist village field trip arc is the best example of wasted potential. And if they just wanted it to be SoL that\u2019d be fine but they still want stakes and tension but there\u2019s barely any of it because they never try to make it to hard or difficult (at least from the first 100 episodes I watched). They should\u2019ve just made it a seasonal anime so they could\u2019ve at least spent more time on it and had better writing. And actually explored the stories they wanted to try to the fullest.   \n    \nThere\u2019s so much that could\u2019ve been done with Boruto but it\u2019s mostly half assed shit and even with Kishimoto fully taking over the writing of manga I don\u2019t know if he can salvage it completely. The anime is mostly filler (not like non-canon filler just fluff filler). It\u2019s good here and there but honestly the most enjoyment I\u2019ve gotten has been any of the old characters focus or like the Mirai hot spring arc from the novels. And while I do also like half the new generation the other half is so goddamn forgettable to worthless garbage like fucking Denki. Or again, they\u2019re wasted potential like Hanabi\u2019s squad.   \n   \nJust to wrap this long-winded shit up, Boruto hasn\u2019t ruined Naruto or anything, we all still have the old series. I\u2019m just sad it didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential. And honestly it didn\u2019t need to be the same tone to not being fucking babied down the way it has when it comes to some of the violence. Ah well.",

When people refer to times of peace, they really just mean that there is no longer a whole fucking battle royale between the 5 uber powerful nations. \n\nDo evil people still exist, yea obviously, but that doesn't mean they should still train children in near-death situations just because of that. Boruto is still a genin. \n\nHe can work his way up until to a Jonin then be dispatched to deal with climactic situations like that or whatever.

I brought up the fact that Boruto is more competent, as to disprove your point as to how he and his generation are light-hearted. Are they light-hearted compared to Naruto's generation? Of course they are, but Naruto's generation was not normal(i.e. war time, and literal fucking child soldiers).\n\nAs for capture the flag. Listen bro, I'm not going to say you're stupid or anything, so please don't take it that way. But can you REALLY not see as to how capture the flag could have real life applications in the Ninja world? Replace the flag for enemy intel, or even a rogue ninja you have to capture.\n\nI'm gonna repeat myself again but fuck it, I've already gone this far. There's no need for life or death tests anymore to test or improve the skills of literal children(that's what they are.) Capture the flag is more than adequate enough to test them. Could the tests be more serious and grave? Yes, I'd be willing to give you that but I can make that argument for nearly everything.\n\nI don't know what country you're from, but the world we live in as of right now is the most peaceful it has ever been. That doesn't mean we should literally always think of what the next worst case scenario could be and start training nearly everyone to be \"as powerful as they can\", in your own words.

I understand what you mean about capture the flag but comparing CAPTURE  THE FLAG to GATHERING ENEMY INTEL or CAPTURING ENEMY NINJA is really dumb (no offense) and it's a bit of a stretch. Their is still need for  life and or death test at times for without death or near death situations it will most likely produce lite hearted people. As explained in a kakashi novel (cannon btw) a country was gonna go to war with the land of fire since the fact that the land of fire currently have a huge amount of lite hearted and softened shinobi (due to them being in peace for a long time)gave them a reason and opening to try and invade. Situations like these make it be necessary for more in death situations for it provides less lite hearted shinobi and prevents openings like these. Btw comparing the shinobi world to our world  was kind of dumb (no offense).",

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense).

Like the pacing, it's like 1 filler than 2 episodes of story, and the filler will sometimes start you on the path toward story. In both the og Naruto, and shippuden, the pacing felt so slow. And the kaguya battle was torture, but I wanted to get the full story. It was like 2-4 episodes of filler than battle. And that's where boruto gets most of it's points, and all in all, it is an enjoyable show. If it wasn't, Naruto fans probably wouldn't watch it because it was so bad.",

I'm assuming that at most, the very large clans could field 1000 combatants at a time. I'd be surprised if a single battle during the clan wars involved more than 5k combatants. Warfare during that era was probably more frequent, but low-intensity, sort of like historical tribal warfare between honor cultures.\n\n\nGoing off the real world history of China and Japan, who had periods of warfare called the \"era of warring states\", Kishimoto has his history backwards. The era of warring states was the period when powerful centralized states waged war against each other. This was long past the era of low-intensity clan warfare.",

World peace just means the nations will no longer turn on each other and there will never be a \u201cnext wartime\u201d. This does not mean the end of all conflict. They can still write more conflict using rogue shinobi, aliens, etc. without changing the definition of world peace.

That\u2019s why the chuunin exams aren\u2019t as harsh anymore. There is no reason for it to remain a death match when there will be no more wars. The average ninja doesn\u2019t need to be trained to deal with Otsutski aliens, they need to be trained to deal with rogue ninja and other criminals. Before they were trained to be child soldiers for war but there\u2019s no reason to keep the chuunin exams that way anymore.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to follow Boruto if you don\u2019t want to.

I,was excited for more after seeing the Boruto movie but aside from a few moments here and there and the expansion of the chunin exams on the anime it\u2019s just been a disappointment that I eventually just couldn\u2019t soldier through anymore. I want to read the manga but Ikemoto\u2019s art is fucking awful and he draws every 12 year old (especially Sarada) like a stripper. So I\u2019m waiting for the anime to adapt it.    \n    \nMy problem has never been the tone I love the idea of exploring the world post peace and what a ninja world bred on war and child soldiers would be like during peace and the problems that can still arise from it. But the anime just wastes anything they try. The Hidden Mist village field trip arc is the best example of wasted potential. And if they just wanted it to be SoL that\u2019d be fine but they still want stakes and tension but there\u2019s barely any of it because they never try to make it to hard or difficult (at least from the first 100 episodes I watched). They should\u2019ve just made it a seasonal anime so they could\u2019ve at least spent more time on it and had better writing. And actually explored the stories they wanted to try to the fullest.   \n    \nThere\u2019s so much that could\u2019ve been done with Boruto but it\u2019s mostly half assed shit and even with Kishimoto fully taking over the writing of manga I don\u2019t know if he can salvage it completely. The anime is mostly filler (not like non-canon filler just fluff filler). It\u2019s good here and there but honestly the most enjoyment I\u2019ve gotten has been any of the old characters focus or like the Mirai hot spring arc from the novels. And while I do also like half the new generation the other half is so goddamn forgettable to worthless garbage like fucking Denki. Or again, they\u2019re wasted potential like Hanabi\u2019s squad.   \n   \nJust to wrap this long-winded shit up, Boruto hasn\u2019t ruined Naruto or anything, we all still have the old series. I\u2019m just sad it didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential. And honestly it didn\u2019t need to be the same tone to not being fucking babied down the way it has when it comes to some of the violence. Ah well.",

Of course they are, but Naruto's generation was not normal(i.e. war time, and literal fucking child soldiers).\n\nAs for capture the flag. Listen bro, I'm not going to say you're stupid or anything, so please don't take it that way. But can you REALLY not see as to how capture the flag could have real life applications in the Ninja world? Replace the flag for enemy intel, or even a rogue ninja you have to capture.\n\nI'm gonna repeat myself again but fuck it, I've already gone this far. There's no need for life or death tests anymore to test or improve the skills of literal children(that's what they are.) Capture the flag is more than adequate enough to test them. Could the tests be more serious and grave? Yes, I'd be willing to give you that but I can make that argument for nearly everything.\n\nI don't know what country you're from, but the world we live in as of right now is the most peaceful it has ever been. That doesn't mean we should literally always think of what the next worst case scenario could be and start training nearly everyone to be \"as powerful as they can\", in your own words.

Their is still need for  life and or death test at times for without death or near death situations it will most likely produce lite hearted people. As explained in a kakashi novel (cannon btw) a country was gonna go to war with the land of fire since the fact that the land of fire currently have a huge amount of lite hearted and softened shinobi (due to them being in peace for a long time)gave them a reason and opening to try and invade. Situations like these make it be necessary for more in death situations for it provides less lite hearted shinobi and prevents openings like these.

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense).

I'm assuming that at most, the very large clans could field 1000 combatants at a time. I'd be surprised if a single battle during the clan wars involved more than 5k combatants. Warfare during that era was probably more frequent, but low-intensity, sort of like historical tribal warfare between honor cultures.\n\n\nGoing off the real world history of China and Japan, who had periods of warfare called the \"era of warring states\", Kishimoto has his history backwards. The era of warring states was the period when powerful centralized states waged war against each other. This was long past the era of low-intensity clan warfare.",

World peace just means the nations will no longer turn on each other and there will never be a \u201cnext wartime\u201d. This does not mean the end of all conflict.

That\u2019s why the chuunin exams aren\u2019t as harsh anymore. There is no reason for it to remain a death match when there will be no more wars. The average ninja doesn\u2019t need to be trained to deal with Otsutski aliens, they need to be trained to deal with rogue ninja and other criminals.

I,was excited for more after seeing the Boruto movie but aside from a few moments here and there and the expansion of the chunin exams on the anime it\u2019s just been a disappointment that I eventually just couldn\u2019t soldier through anymore. I want to read the manga but Ikemoto\u2019s art is fucking awful and he draws every 12 year old (especially Sarada) like a stripper. So I\u2019m waiting for the anime to adapt it.    \n    \nMy problem has never been the tone I love the idea of exploring the world post peace and what a ninja world bred on war and child soldiers would be like during peace and the problems that can still arise from it. But the anime just wastes anything they try. The Hidden Mist village field trip arc is the best example of wasted potential. And if they just wanted it to be SoL that\u2019d be fine but they still want stakes and tension but there\u2019s barely any of it because they never try to make it to hard or difficult (at least from the first 100 episodes I watched). They should\u2019ve just made it a seasonal anime so they could\u2019ve at least spent more time on it and had better writing. And actually explored the stories they wanted to try to the fullest.   \n    \nThere\u2019s so much that could\u2019ve been done with Boruto but it\u2019s mostly half assed shit and even with Kishimoto fully taking over the writing of manga I don\u2019t know if he can salvage it completely. The anime is mostly filler (not like non-canon filler just fluff filler). It\u2019s good here and there but honestly the most enjoyment I\u2019ve gotten has been any of the old characters focus or like the Mirai hot spring arc from the novels. And while I do also like half the new generation the other half is so goddamn forgettable to worthless garbage like fucking Denki. Or again, they\u2019re wasted potential like Hanabi\u2019s squad.   \n   \nJust to wrap this long-winded shit up, Boruto hasn\u2019t ruined Naruto or anything, we all still have the old series. I\u2019m just sad it didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential. And honestly it didn\u2019t need to be the same tone to not being fucking babied down the way it has when it comes to some of the violence. Ah well.",

Listen bro, I'm not going to say you're stupid or anything, so please don't take it that way. But can you REALLY not see as to how capture the flag could have real life applications in the Ninja world? Replace the flag for enemy intel, or even a rogue ninja you have to capture.\n\nI'm gonna repeat myself again but fuck it, I've already gone this far. There's no need for life or death tests anymore to test or improve the skills of literal children(that's what they are.) Capture the flag is more than adequate enough to test them. Could the tests be more serious and grave? Yes, I'd be willing to give you that but I can make that argument for nearly everything.\n\nI don't know what country you're from, but the world we live in as of right now is the most peaceful it has ever been.

Their is still need for  life and or death test at times for without death or near death situations it will most likely produce lite hearted people. As explained in a kakashi novel (cannon btw) a country was gonna go to war with the land of fire since the fact that the land of fire currently have a huge amount of lite hearted and softened shinobi (due to them being in peace for a long time)gave them a reason and opening to try and invade. Situations like these make it be necessary for more in death situations for it provides less lite hearted shinobi and prevents openings like these.

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense). Btw English isn't my first language and thx for being thoughtful.",

World peace just means the nations will no longer turn on each other and there will never be a \u201cnext wartime\u201d. This does not mean the end of all conflict. They can still write more conflict using rogue shinobi, aliens, etc. without changing the definition of world peace.

That\u2019s why the chuunin exams aren\u2019t as harsh anymore. There is no reason for it to remain a death match when there will be no more wars. The average ninja doesn\u2019t need to be trained to deal with Otsutski aliens, they need to be trained to deal with rogue ninja and other criminals. Before they were trained to be child soldiers for war but there\u2019s no reason to keep the chuunin exams that way anymore.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to follow Boruto if you don\u2019t want to. Due to the nature of Boruto\u2019s world the story and environment is going to be different than Naruto\u2019s world, so you\u2019ll have to accept that it\u2019s developed if you do.",

You saying that didn't disprove anything I said. I understand what you mean about capture the flag but comparing CAPTURE  THE FLAG to GATHERING ENEMY INTEL or CAPTURING ENEMY NINJA is really dumb (no offense) and it's a bit of a stretch. Their is still need for  life and or death test at times for without death or near death situations it will most likely produce lite hearted people. As explained in a kakashi novel (cannon btw) a country was gonna go to war with the land of fire since the fact that the land of fire currently have a huge amount of lite hearted and softened shinobi (due to them being in peace for a long time)gave them a reason and opening to try and invade. Situations like these make it be necessary for more in death situations for it provides less lite hearted shinobi and prevents openings like these. Btw comparing the shinobi world to our world  was kind of dumb (no offense).",

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense).

It was an analogy that was completely valid, to show you the ridiculousness of trying to make everyone as powerful as they can be for some \"hypothetical\" threat. Also I haven't read the Kakashi novel so I won't speak to that. \n\nAlso lmao, apparently I don't know what competent means, even though I do. That's rich coming from someone who keeps misspelling \"light-hearted\". I don't know if English is your first language or not, and I'm not going to make fun of you for that, but you can't say I don't know what competent means. Believe it or not, competent is actually a synonym for skilled. They aren't different things, they are actually one and the same. All you have to do is a quick google search, since you're so confident that I didn't use the word competent correctly lol. \n\nNow, apparently I have to put this into context for you. When you say Boruto is light-hearted, that is an encompassing statement. I disproved that by bringing up how he is actually a better shinobi than his father was at his age. The time of Boruto isn't as dark as Naruto, but that doesn't make it light-hearted. That's what I was saying.\n\nAs for the capture the flag, believe it or not, but certain games are designed to teach certain skills. A game is just a form of a controlled environment, where there are few variables, so a key skill can be taught quickly, and in a safe manner. It's not a stretch AT ALL to substitute the flag for enemy intel. We even see this with the scrolls in Naruto PTS. Capture the flag is just a heavily watered down version of that, in where there is a objective that you have to capture, while protecting your own from being captured. It's literally the exact same premise. I'm not stretching anything, all it takes is a little bit of critical thinking on your part.",

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense).

As you recently stated competent is a form of saying skilled but you were using competent as a form to contradict the fact I called this new generation \"light\"-heartedly (spelled it right this time lol). Regardless being skilled doesn't mean you aren't light hearted. I'm not saying that Boruto is ligh-hearted due to the fact that compared to naruto he isn't as dark, I'm saying that although this new generation was born in a time of peace they have to mature and be more ruthless to some extent and having chunin exams that are so childish isnt helping that's why I used the incident in the novel as an example. I still think that comparing capture the flag to capturing a enemy and gathering Intel is a bit of a stretch due to each being on and requiring separate skill level,  but i understand were your going with this and i agree that certain games can help further develop one's skill. Regardless comparing a world were being the most powerful you can be to reach one's goal (in which is the route almost everyone takes) to our world is kind of dumb (no offense). I'm trying to say that comparing a world were most people devote themselves to be ninjas and being the most powerful they can be to our world were people don't devote themselves to be the most powerful they can be and focus on a numerous amount of things is kind of dumb (no offense). Btw English isn't my first language and thx for being thoughtful.",
