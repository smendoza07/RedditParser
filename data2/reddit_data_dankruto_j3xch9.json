From his perspective he lost everything and started to become cynical. \n\nSo funny to think Tobi would become the main bad guy in the series lol. \n\nI don\u2019t hate on Boruto, it\u2019s definitely carving it\u2019s own niche but idk, I can\u2019t get into it. I heard the manga is dope tho but I\u2019m more of a visual person so once the anime is starting to kick it\u2019s gear I might come back",

He even came back years later and did another tsukiyomi to make sure that Sasukes hate was extreme enough. \n\nAs for the emotionally stunting thing, I think you\u2019re conflating real life to what\u2019s what\u2019s portrayed in this fictional series. In this series extreme emotions, hate, etc, fuel an Uchiha\u2019s power. Yes he\u2019s more emotionally f\u2019ed up, but he\u2019s also a lot stronger and more power hungry. \nItachi made that trade off. There\u2019s pros and cons to how itachi went about it but his actions were necessary for what he wanted to accomplish (or rather wanted Sasuke to accomplish)",

He was even planning to mind control him so that sasuke would turn good. And this was all because of what itachi wanted. What about what sasuke wanted, like ya know having a family. O get that the uchiha clan massacre was necessary, but mindufucking his brother wasn't necessary and it was only done because of what \"itachi wanted\". Honestly I dont blame sasuke for saying \"screw what itachi wanted\" and going after the village. Whether you like it or not, itachi definitely isnt an example of a  \"good person\".\n\nStill cool tho",

In this series extreme emotions, hate, etc, fuel an Uchiha\u2019s power.

In this series extreme emotions, hate, etc, fuel an Uchiha\u2019s power.

Honestly I dont blame sasuke for saying \"screw what itachi wanted\" and going after the village.
