Besides that's a bad match up anyway, Kiba's and his dog's senses would have been able to locate invisible guy\n\n>One more thing, kakashi does not equal 100 jonin,\n\nDo you not remeber Madara vs the shinobi alliance? Their had to be at least over a 100  jonin in their, and that was not even Madara's powered up state. Kakashi went toe toe with So6p Obito, who is stronger than base Madara.\n\n>I mean the fodder jonin were able to easily stop gaara when he was about to kill lee\n\nNo, Might Guy stopped that fight, do you think Guy is garbage level? And Garaa was under orders not to expose himself too much, which is why he didn't fight the test proctors.\n\n>meaning gaaras not even jonin level,\n\nGaraa at the time was almost kage level, not quite but getting their. He becomes one just two years later.",

Aside from Naruto and Saske, who each possessed unreachable gifts (and the other ginchuriki) the strongest villains and heroes were ultimately older ninjas. Madera, naruto dad, 1st hokage, pervy sage, pain, etc.\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions, but I didnt generally see any significant boost in power given to the younger folks. I think this is because the naruto world puts little impact on age, so generally, the older you get = the stronger you get, because you have that many more years of training and time to learn jutsu.\n\nThis may be skewed because we only see the handful of legendary ninjas from older generations and not the gen pop of scrubs that I'm sure existed.",

Aside from Naruto and Saske, who each possessed unreachable gifts (and the other ginchuriki) the strongest villains and heroes were ultimately older ninjas. Madera, naruto dad, 1st hokage, pervy sage, pain, etc.\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions, but I didnt generally see any significant boost in power given to the younger folks. I think this is because the naruto world puts little impact on age, so generally, the older you get = the stronger you get, because you have that many more years of training and time to learn jutsu.\n\nThis may be skewed because we only see the handful of legendary ninjas from older generations and not the gen pop of scrubs that I'm sure existed.",

Orochimaru did the same thing to Konoha. He surrendered himself to them and offered all his knowledge and technology to them in exchange for his life.\n\nKakashi accepted and then sentenced him to a life sentence of house arrest. Orochimaru could continue with his experiments but with 24h surveillance and without using humans, only Zetsus' bodies.\n\nThe Land of Fire is far, far more technologically advanced than other nations because of this agreement.",

Their had to be at least over a 100  jonin in their, and that was not even Madara's powered up state. Kakashi went toe toe with So6p Obito, who is stronger than base Madara.\n\n>I mean the fodder jonin were able to easily stop gaara when he was about to kill lee\n\nNo, Might Guy stopped that fight, do you think Guy is garbage level? And Garaa was under orders not to expose himself too much, which is why he didn't fight the test proctors.\n\n>meaning gaaras not even jonin level,\n\nGaraa at the time was almost kage level, not quite but getting their.

Aside from Naruto and Saske, who each possessed unreachable gifts (and the other ginchuriki) the strongest villains and heroes were ultimately older ninjas.

I think this is because the naruto world puts little impact on age, so generally, the older you get = the stronger you get, because you have that many more years of training and time to learn jutsu.\n\nThis may be skewed because we only see the handful of legendary ninjas from older generations and not the gen pop of scrubs that I'm sure existed.",

And Garaa was under orders not to expose himself too much, which is why he didn't fight the test proctors.\n\n>meaning gaaras not even jonin level,\n\nGaraa at the time was almost kage level, not quite but getting their.

I think this is because the naruto world puts little impact on age, so generally, the older you get = the stronger you get, because you have that many more years of training and time to learn jutsu.\n\nThis may be skewed because we only see the handful of legendary ninjas from older generations and not the gen pop of scrubs that I'm sure existed.",

Their had to be at least over a 100  jonin in their, and that was not even Madara's powered up state. Kakashi went toe toe with So6p Obito, who is stronger than base Madara.\n\n>I mean the fodder jonin were able to easily stop gaara when he was about to kill lee\n\nNo, Might Guy stopped that fight, do you think Guy is garbage level? And Garaa was under orders not to expose himself too much, which is why he didn't fight the test proctors.\n\n>meaning gaaras not even jonin level,\n\nGaraa at the time was almost kage level, not quite but getting their.

Aside from Naruto and Saske, who each possessed unreachable gifts (and the other ginchuriki) the strongest villains and heroes were ultimately older ninjas. Madera, naruto dad, 1st hokage, pervy sage, pain, etc.\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions, but I didnt generally see any significant boost in power given to the younger folks. I think this is because the naruto world puts little impact on age, so generally, the older you get = the stronger you get, because you have that many more years of training and time to learn jutsu.\n\nThis may be skewed because we only see the handful of legendary ninjas from older generations and not the gen pop of scrubs that I'm sure existed.",

I think this is because the naruto world puts little impact on age, so generally, the older you get = the stronger you get, because you have that many more years of training and time to learn jutsu.\n\nThis may be skewed because we only see the handful of legendary ninjas from older generations and not the gen pop of scrubs that I'm sure existed.",

Their had to be at least over a 100  jonin in their, and that was not even Madara's powered up state.
