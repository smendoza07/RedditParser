Stakes were real because it was a win or lose and not life or death, so there was no inherent plot armor like with any Kakashi, Naruto, or Sasuke fight, you were on the edge of your seat the entire time because you legitimately didn't know who would win. Lee dropping the weights is easily top 3 moments of the series, it set the bar for basically everything coming after it.",

I definitely think Lee vs Garra is up there for anime in general, but idt any Naruto fight is taking the best in anime slot. MHA's All Might vs All for One is gonna be a contender. Luffy vs Ussopp is honestly up there for me too, really a lot of one piece fights are above most Naruto fights imo. Goku vs Piccolo and Goku vs Vegeta can't be slept on, especially if you get into how influential the stuff can be. OPM vs Sea King is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen, and it made me cry, but I could just be a bitch. Plus, Boruto has actually had some contenders too, especially if you count Naruto and Sasuke fighting in the movie.",

Goku vs Piccolo is late DB so there's not even flight, its all technique and hard hits. Vegeta vs Goku is similar, except it has the first and honestly the best beam struggle of the series, and that includes Gohan vs Cell. Luffy vs Ussopp hits hard for me cause of how raw it is. I read One Piece instead of watching so idk how well it is there, but the fight had so much behind it. Its honestly on the same level as Obito vs Kakashi in that way,  where the fight was fun but what made it was the build up and specifically what came after.",

Sakura should have been a part of every Sasuke fight, but he just left her high and dry to become a nurse mom? What happened to her prowess with dispelling genjutsu that he wrote her in the chunin exams? That would have been useful against Sasuke so many damn times but it was forgotten the second Orochimaru made a Sasuke-kabob.",

I definitely think Lee vs Garra is up there for anime in general, but idt any Naruto fight is taking the best in anime slot. MHA's All Might vs All for One is gonna be a contender. Luffy vs Ussopp is honestly up there for me too, really a lot of one piece fights are above most Naruto fights imo. Goku vs Piccolo and Goku vs Vegeta can't be slept on, especially if you get into how influential the stuff can be. OPM vs Sea King is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen, and it made me cry, but I could just be a bitch. Plus, Boruto has actually had some contenders too, especially if you count Naruto and Sasuke fighting in the movie.",

Goku vs Piccolo is late DB so there's not even flight, its all technique and hard hits. Vegeta vs Goku is similar, except it has the first and honestly the best beam struggle of the series, and that includes Gohan vs Cell. Luffy vs Ussopp hits hard for me cause of how raw it is. I read One Piece instead of watching so idk how well it is there, but the fight had so much behind it. Its honestly on the same level as Obito vs Kakashi in that way,  where the fight was fun but what made it was the build up and specifically what came after.",

Sakura should have been a part of every Sasuke fight, but he just left her high and dry to become a nurse mom? What happened to her prowess with dispelling genjutsu that he wrote her in the chunin exams? That would have been useful against Sasuke so many damn times but it was forgotten the second Orochimaru made a Sasuke-kabob.",

Goku vs Piccolo and Goku vs Vegeta can't be slept on, especially if you get into how influential the stuff can be. OPM vs Sea King is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen, and it made me cry, but I could just be a bitch.

OPM vs Sea King is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen, and it made me cry, but I could just be a bitch.

It is better in a lot of ways. It's Kishimoto's decision to tell about Boruto not Naruto. Respect the writer. If there's Minato manga then Naruto came out as a sequel. I believe you people gonna hate it\n\nMinato was almost a perfect shinobi than Naruto with dumb thinking earlier on. \n\nThink about it",

Goku vs Piccolo and Goku vs Vegeta can't be slept on, especially if you get into how influential the stuff can be. OPM vs Sea King is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen, and it made me cry, but I could just be a bitch.

I read One Piece instead of watching so idk how well it is there, but the fight had so much behind it. Its honestly on the same level as Obito vs Kakashi in that way,  where the fight was fun but what made it was the build up and specifically what came after.",

Goku vs Piccolo and Goku vs Vegeta can't be slept on, especially if you get into how influential the stuff can be. OPM vs Sea King is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen, and it made me cry, but I could just be a bitch.

Goku vs Piccolo is late DB so there's not even flight, its all technique and hard hits. Vegeta vs Goku is similar, except it has the first and honestly the best beam struggle of the series, and that includes Gohan vs Cell. Luffy vs Ussopp hits hard for me cause of how raw it is. I read One Piece instead of watching so idk how well it is there, but the fight had so much behind it. Its honestly on the same level as Obito vs Kakashi in that way,  where the fight was fun but what made it was the build up and specifically what came after.",

Goku vs Piccolo is late DB so there's not even flight, its all technique and hard hits. Vegeta vs Goku is similar, except it has the first and honestly the best beam struggle of the series, and that includes Gohan vs Cell. Luffy vs Ussopp hits hard for me cause of how raw it is. I read One Piece instead of watching so idk how well it is there, but the fight had so much behind it. Its honestly on the same level as Obito vs Kakashi in that way,  where the fight was fun but what made it was the build up and specifically what came after.",

Goku vs Piccolo is late DB so there's not even flight, its all technique and hard hits. Vegeta vs Goku is similar, except it has the first and honestly the best beam struggle of the series, and that includes Gohan vs Cell. Luffy vs Ussopp hits hard for me cause of how raw it is. I read One Piece instead of watching so idk how well it is there, but the fight had so much behind it. Its honestly on the same level as Obito vs Kakashi in that way,  where the fight was fun but what made it was the build up and specifically what came after.",
