    "body": "I was mostly kidding, but this is pretty easy, and frankly u/discreet7269 did most of the hard work - it's a lot of the same issues on both sides, just flipped. A lot of people will read these threads and think we're bashing on the other side, but not really - just bashing on guys who are salty and shady, like he's bashing on scammers and flakes. I don't see anything here that's throwing shade at legit SDs or SBs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Signs of arrogance and pomposity: Any comments about being alpha or not being \"an old man who has to pay women to date him\", or really any shade thrown at (his perception of) other guys on SA.\n2. Overly sexual texting before meeting: The reason he's focused on the sexting rather than waiting for actually meeting and having sex is, he will never actually meet.\n3. Asking for more pix when you've already shown a clear pic of your face and of your body. Exception: if he wants proof I'm real and asks for a pic pressing a spoon against my nose with my left hand or whatever - I find that annoying but not a red flag.\n4. Offers a ton of money: always a scam\n5. Wanting to meet same day: John \n6. Makes a dollar offer right away: John, and will require anal\n7. Anything involving a contract or questionnaire or application to fill out\n8. Very young: we've had a few here that seem legit, but my experience is it's always some PUA bullshit. IMO, under 50 is a red flag, under 40 is two bright red flags.\n9. Claims to be single, but still wants discretion, won't give reason: He is married and will bring the drama.\n10. Looking for \"no drama\": More drama than a llama!",

Most have other dating options and their looks are intact. So when escorts and pros run into the younger SD, first they are intimidated because there is no looks or youth premium. \n\nSecond, these guys have no incentive to line up the escorts pocket. So when the pro says she got paid xyz (big ppm) in her prior relationship, she is kindly asked to take a hike. \n\nHence you see escorts and pros targeting the oldest guy on the block. Most vulnerable, zero dating options, has to pay to date period.",

And I don't mean to be racist by bringing up race, but I'm an American living over in Germany right now, and I think there is a massive cultural difference between certainly blacks in America and the white European girls I'm finding myself involved with. A lot of them are students or even younger, but definitely don't see themselves as sex workers or anything like that. So what I've gathered is the attitude and differences in mentality between the girls I find myself interested in and a lot of the ladies I see comment here on this subreddit is massive. Like all of the rules and behaviors and everything people warn about here on Reddit, just seems like all of that is coming from ladies who are in this pretty much exclusively for the money. Those aren't really the girls that I go for.",

So of course I would say black women are just as interested in connection as white women or Hispanic or any woman out there. But the men in the sugar bowl, by and large, are very different from the women many black women would normally be romantically interested in. Now, you are absolutely right I'm jumping to conclusions or at least making assumptions that may not be accurate. But because I think the men on SA are quite different from the men a lot of black women may typically have romantic interest in, it would mean that their interest in the men on SA may be more financially motivated and less motivated by finding someone who may turn out to be a romantic partner. Whereas a white woman is more likely to meet someone on SA who could actually turn into a serious, committed relationship, marriage, etc. Does that make any sense or am I way off the mark do you think?",

Exception: if he wants proof I'm real and asks for a pic pressing a spoon against my nose with my left hand or whatever - I find that annoying but not a red flag.\n\nThis is an interesting one from an SD perspective.  Totally understandable about filtering pic collectors.  The one thing I'd urge SBs is to be mindful about the phrase \"clear pic of your body\".  I find myself requesting another body pic, fairly often.  Fairly recently I requested one, and the SB correctly pointed out that she has a dozen pics on her profile (absolutely true) and that that should be sufficient (absolutely not true -- a dozen pics, all of which are turned sideways, with loose clothes, bending over, etc).   She was clearly very convinced and confident she had \"clear pics of her body\".  In fact, she had none, and the fact that she didn't have any makes her EXTRA suspicious. How in the world can someone put this many body pics on their profile and not even accidentally have one that shows her shape?\n\nA clear pic of your body is full body, from the front, in clothes that show your shape.  Not from the top ala instagram angle, not sitting, not turning sideways, not in a long jacket that strategically drapes over the outside of your hips, not in black pants in an underexposed shot where your lower body melds into blackness.\n\nI will no longer waste my time meeting SBs who don't show a full body pic.  I end up asking for one fairly often.  I'm very respectful about it, and just so I be a little gentler, I have a pic of myself I can reference on my profile, full body, from the front, in jeans and a form-fitting shirt that would let you see if I have a paunch or noodle arms or whatever.  So as I request it, I reference \"just like pic #3 on my profile\".    Amusingly, it's pretty common the SB will send me ANOTHER pic turned sideways or whatever... and I ALWAYS thank her, tell her how beautiful it is, and then re-request again a pic from the front, like my pic #3 on my profile",

(I guess it also depends what you consider \u201ca ton of money\u201d. Personally, I get a low 5 figure allowance and started with a 4 figure PPM and it\u2019s been 2 years next month, but that\u2019s not \u201ca ton of money\u201d in a high COL area, but still generous. It\u2019s also because we are exclusive and he wants me available to travel with him on a whim). I don\u2019t think we should say generous SD\u2019s are ALWAYS a scam. Better to let it see how it plays out (but *obviously* not send pics, dirty talk, intimacy etc with the promise of a generous allowance *later*)",

You know how nobody picks up their phone any more if they don't recognize the caller ID? And this, despite the fact that one of those calls may legit be a person that you want to speak to but just don't recognize the number? Because they get 100 calls in a row to renew the warranty on the car they don't even have, so they just ignore them all?\n\nIt's pretty much the same thing. If I logged in and had two messages, then maybe I read them both, but there's so much garbage, you need a triage/filter. And young guys get filtered out by me. At this point, I'd probably need five in a row that are exactly what I'm looking for just to even the score relative to time I've already wasted.\n\nFor me, it's a good filter because I really am not that attracted to younger guys anyway, most of the time. YMMV.",

I get all the pleasure and energy of a wonderful woman in my life with none of the usual maintenance required in a vanilla relationship.

Which works out great as it is what most Sugar Babies want. I\u2019m also very busy and spontaneous. In my opinion meeting the same day for dinner is just how it works best some times. I may have been consumed with bullshit all day. Realize I have the evening to myself and why not M&G and see if I can find an arrangement. After all the worst part of an arrangement is finding one. Then it\u2019s all good times. I will say\u2026 I think I\u2019m\nA great SD. I never talk about sex prior to meeting. I also never request pictures nor do I care to see nudes before meeting.

I'm mostly talking to girls who are interested in just meeting a guy they like who is also willing to spoil them and/or support them. They're really much more interested in finding guys they can establish emotional connections with but who also have money. This subreddit seems overwhelmed with women, a lot of whom I believe are African American, who approach sugar dating as just a job or a source of income. And I don't mean to be racist by bringing up race, but I'm an American living over in Germany right now, and I think there is a massive cultural difference between certainly blacks in America and the white European girls I'm finding myself involved with. A lot of them are students or even younger, but definitely don't see themselves as sex workers or anything like that. So what I've gathered is the attitude and differences in mentality between the girls I find myself interested in and a lot of the ladies I see comment here on this subreddit is massive. Like all of the rules and behaviors and everything people warn about here on Reddit, just seems like all of that is coming from ladies who are in this pretty much exclusively for the money. Those aren't really the girls that I go for.",

So of course I would say black women are just as interested in connection as white women or Hispanic or any woman out there. But the men in the sugar bowl, by and large, are very different from the women many black women would normally be romantically interested in. Now, you are absolutely right I'm jumping to conclusions or at least making assumptions that may not be accurate. But because I think the men on SA are quite different from the men a lot of black women may typically have romantic interest in, it would mean that their interest in the men on SA may be more financially motivated and less motivated by finding someone who may turn out to be a romantic partner. Whereas a white woman is more likely to meet someone on SA who could actually turn into a serious, committed relationship, marriage, etc. Does that make any sense or am I way off the mark do you think?",

You know how nobody picks up their phone any more if they don't recognize the caller ID? And this, despite the fact that one of those calls may legit be a person that you want to speak to but just don't recognize the number? Because they get 100 calls in a row to renew the warranty on the car they don't even have, so they just ignore them all?\n\nIt's pretty much the same thing. If I logged in and had two messages, then maybe I read them both, but there's so much garbage, you need a triage/filter. And young guys get filtered out by me. At this point, I'd probably need five in a row that are exactly what I'm looking for just to even the score relative to time I've already wasted.\n\nFor me, it's a good filter because I really am not that attracted to younger guys anyway, most of the time.

I'm mostly talking to girls who are interested in just meeting a guy they like who is also willing to spoil them and/or support them. They're really much more interested in finding guys they can establish emotional connections with but who also have money. This subreddit seems overwhelmed with women, a lot of whom I believe are African American, who approach sugar dating as just a job or a source of income. And I don't mean to be racist by bringing up race, but I'm an American living over in Germany right now, and I think there is a massive cultural difference between certainly blacks in America and the white European girls I'm finding myself involved with. A lot of them are students or even younger, but definitely don't see themselves as sex workers or anything like that. So what I've gathered is the attitude and differences in mentality between the girls I find myself interested in and a lot of the ladies I see comment here on this subreddit is massive. Like all of the rules and behaviors and everything people warn about here on Reddit, just seems like all of that is coming from ladies who are in this pretty much exclusively for the money. Those aren't really the girls that I go for.",

So of course I would say black women are just as interested in connection as white women or Hispanic or any woman out there. But the men in the sugar bowl, by and large, are very different from the women many black women would normally be romantically interested in. Now, you are absolutely right I'm jumping to conclusions or at least making assumptions that may not be accurate. But because I think the men on SA are quite different from the men a lot of black women may typically have romantic interest in, it would mean that their interest in the men on SA may be more financially motivated and less motivated by finding someone who may turn out to be a romantic partner. Whereas a white woman is more likely to meet someone on SA who could actually turn into a serious, committed relationship, marriage, etc. Does that make any sense or am I way off the mark do you think?",

I'm mostly talking to girls who are interested in just meeting a guy they like who is also willing to spoil them and/or support them. They're really much more interested in finding guys they can establish emotional connections with but who also have money. This subreddit seems overwhelmed with women, a lot of whom I believe are African American, who approach sugar dating as just a job or a source of income. And I don't mean to be racist by bringing up race, but I'm an American living over in Germany right now, and I think there is a massive cultural difference between certainly blacks in America and the white European girls I'm finding myself involved with. A lot of them are students or even younger, but definitely don't see themselves as sex workers or anything like that. So what I've gathered is the attitude and differences in mentality between the girls I find myself interested in and a lot of the ladies I see comment here on this subreddit is massive. Like all of the rules and behaviors and everything people warn about here on Reddit, just seems like all of that is coming from ladies who are in this pretty much exclusively for the money. Those aren't really the girls that I go for.",

So of course I would say black women are just as interested in connection as white women or Hispanic or any woman out there. But the men in the sugar bowl, by and large, are very different from the women many black women would normally be romantically interested in. Now, you are absolutely right I'm jumping to conclusions or at least making assumptions that may not be accurate. But because I think the men on SA are quite different from the men a lot of black women may typically have romantic interest in, it would mean that their interest in the men on SA may be more financially motivated and less motivated by finding someone who may turn out to be a romantic partner. Whereas a white woman is more likely to meet someone on SA who could actually turn into a serious, committed relationship, marriage, etc. Does that make any sense or am I way off the mark do you think?",

I'm mostly talking to girls who are interested in just meeting a guy they like who is also willing to spoil them and/or support them. They're really much more interested in finding guys they can establish emotional connections with but who also have money. This subreddit seems overwhelmed with women, a lot of whom I believe are African American, who approach sugar dating as just a job or a source of income. And I don't mean to be racist by bringing up race, but I'm an American living over in Germany right now, and I think there is a massive cultural difference between certainly blacks in America and the white European girls I'm finding myself involved with. A lot of them are students or even younger, but definitely don't see themselves as sex workers or anything like that. So what I've gathered is the attitude and differences in mentality between the girls I find myself interested in and a lot of the ladies I see comment here on this subreddit is massive. Like all of the rules and behaviors and everything people warn about here on Reddit, just seems like all of that is coming from ladies who are in this pretty much exclusively for the money. Those aren't really the girls that I go for.",

So of course I would say black women are just as interested in connection as white women or Hispanic or any woman out there. But the men in the sugar bowl, by and large, are very different from the women many black women would normally be romantically interested in. Now, you are absolutely right I'm jumping to conclusions or at least making assumptions that may not be accurate. But because I think the men on SA are quite different from the men a lot of black women may typically have romantic interest in, it would mean that their interest in the men on SA may be more financially motivated and less motivated by finding someone who may turn out to be a romantic partner. Whereas a white woman is more likely to meet someone on SA who could actually turn into a serious, committed relationship, marriage, etc. Does that make any sense or am I way off the mark do you think?",

I'm mostly talking to girls who are interested in just meeting a guy they like who is also willing to spoil them and/or support them. They're really much more interested in finding guys they can establish emotional connections with but who also have money. This subreddit seems overwhelmed with women, a lot of whom I believe are African American, who approach sugar dating as just a job or a source of income. And I don't mean to be racist by bringing up race, but I'm an American living over in Germany right now, and I think there is a massive cultural difference between certainly blacks in America and the white European girls I'm finding myself involved with. A lot of them are students or even younger, but definitely don't see themselves as sex workers or anything like that. So what I've gathered is the attitude and differences in mentality between the girls I find myself interested in and a lot of the ladies I see comment here on this subreddit is massive. Like all of the rules and behaviors and everything people warn about here on Reddit, just seems like all of that is coming from ladies who are in this pretty much exclusively for the money. Those aren't really the girls that I go for.",

Now, you are absolutely right I'm jumping to conclusions or at least making assumptions that may not be accurate. But because I think the men on SA are quite different from the men a lot of black women may typically have romantic interest in, it would mean that their interest in the men on SA may be more financially motivated and less motivated by finding someone who may turn out to be a romantic partner.
