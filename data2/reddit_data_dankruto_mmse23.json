He's kinda edgy overall but tbh I always felt it suited him so idk. And I rly can't even try to understand how itachi is supposed to be arrogant. Of the uchiha clan in the flashbacks we got to see sasuke's dad who was not only the 3rd strongest ninja in konoha back then but also the leader of the police in konoha so he kinda shouldn't be acting all soft and all besides he cared about the future of konoha more than anything. Other than him theres shisui who was literally the nicest dude in naruto. And itachi who gave up on everything because of a single order. Like I'm not the greatest fan of some of them either but I wouldn't call them arrogant bitches or anything. More like edgy fuckfaces or something like that",

I\u2019m like over 300 episodes into Once Piece and flashbacks happen only in the most critical moments. In Naruto it felt like flashbacks were shown like every episode and most of them we have already seen previously. \n\nAlso One Piece barely has filler, which is impressive considering it\u2019s almost hitting 1000 episodes. Naruto on the other has almost half of its episodes as filler. \n\nNaruto might have been regarded as the best anime ever if it cut the filler and flashbacks.",

Manga is a medium that is a lot of times superior to anime, especially considering that it is the author's original intent, hell there are a lot of manga that work better as manga than anime like Berserk, One Piece, Nejimaki Kagyuu, Bleach and so on...\n\nRead manga is really a have to if you wish to be a considered a hardcore otaku, otherwise you're really just wasting your time, I mean nobody watches Berserk or One Piece because of their adaptations, and in my opinion everyone should read Dragon Ball whether they have watched it or not.\n\nI mean, manga is also a visual medium so sometimes you don't need to go through too  much dialog in some series.",

He's kinda edgy overall but tbh I always felt it suited him so idk. And I rly can't even try to understand how itachi is supposed to be arrogant. Of the uchiha clan in the flashbacks we got to see sasuke's dad who was not only the 3rd strongest ninja in konoha back then but also the leader of the police in konoha so he kinda shouldn't be acting all soft and all besides he cared about the future of konoha more than anything. Other than him theres shisui who was literally the nicest dude in naruto. And itachi who gave up on everything because of a single order. Like I'm not the greatest fan of some of them either but I wouldn't call them arrogant bitches or anything. More like edgy fuckfaces or something like that",

Manga is a medium that is a lot of times superior to anime, especially considering that it is the author's original intent, hell there are a lot of manga that work better as manga than anime like Berserk, One Piece, Nejimaki Kagyuu, Bleach and so on...\n\nRead manga is really a have to if you wish to be a considered a hardcore otaku, otherwise you're really just wasting your time, I mean nobody watches Berserk or One Piece because of their adaptations, and in my opinion everyone should read Dragon Ball whether they have watched it or not.\n\nI mean, manga is also a visual medium so sometimes you don't need to go through too  much dialog in some series.",

If someone actually found a genuine article that proves this theory, then I can accept it. Until then, I do agree that it doesn't sound genuine or has been misconstrued. It's like when people say Napoleon was short (he was about 5' 7\"), or accused witches were burned in the Salem witch trials (they were hanged, and one was crushed with stones).",

He's kinda edgy overall but tbh I always felt it suited him so idk. And I rly can't even try to understand how itachi is supposed to be arrogant. Of the uchiha clan in the flashbacks we got to see sasuke's dad who was not only the 3rd strongest ninja in konoha back then but also the leader of the police in konoha so he kinda shouldn't be acting all soft and all besides he cared about the future of konoha more than anything. Other than him theres shisui who was literally the nicest dude in naruto. And itachi who gave up on everything because of a single order. Like I'm not the greatest fan of some of them either but I wouldn't call them arrogant bitches or anything. More like edgy fuckfaces or something like that",

Manga is a medium that is a lot of times superior to anime, especially considering that it is the author's original intent, hell there are a lot of manga that work better as manga than anime like Berserk, One Piece, Nejimaki Kagyuu, Bleach and so on...\n\nRead manga is really a have to if you wish to be a considered a hardcore otaku, otherwise you're really just wasting your time, I mean nobody watches Berserk or One Piece because of their adaptations, and in my opinion everyone should read Dragon Ball whether they have watched it or not.\n\nI mean, manga is also a visual medium so sometimes you don't need to go through too  much dialog in some series.",

Of the uchiha clan in the flashbacks we got to see sasuke's dad who was not only the 3rd strongest ninja in konoha back then but also the leader of the police in konoha so he kinda shouldn't be acting all soft and all besides he cared about the future of konoha more than anything. Other than him theres shisui who was literally the nicest dude in naruto. And itachi who gave up on everything because of a single order. Like I'm not the greatest fan of some of them either but I wouldn't call them arrogant bitches or anything. More like edgy fuckfaces or something like that",

Until then, I do agree that it doesn't sound genuine or has been misconstrued. It's like when people say Napoleon was short (he was about 5' 7\"), or accused witches were burned in the Salem witch trials (they were hanged, and one was crushed with stones).",

And I rly can't even try to understand how itachi is supposed to be arrogant. Of the uchiha clan in the flashbacks we got to see sasuke's dad who was not only the 3rd strongest ninja in konoha back then but also the leader of the police in konoha so he kinda shouldn't be acting all soft and all besides he cared about the future of konoha more than anything. Other than him theres shisui who was literally the nicest dude in naruto. And itachi who gave up on everything because of a single order. Like I'm not the greatest fan of some of them either but I wouldn't call them arrogant bitches or anything. More like edgy fuckfaces or something like that",
