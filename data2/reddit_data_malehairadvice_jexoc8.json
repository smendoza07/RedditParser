It's not always logical because you can get an expensive one that has silicone and a cheap one that doesn't, so just be aware.\n\nBasically you need to get one without silicone because only sulphates clean silicone, so if you get silicone conditioner and a sulphate free shampoo then you're building up silicone and your hair will get greasy. Also sulphates are what dries out your hair and damages it so it's all-round bad.\n\nBut to be honest if you are getting conditioner without silicone then you don't need the shampoo, you can just co-wash.",

[Here it is.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dlc52yoWdMo4p7RWcVERJS_Lo5NSeDCtV2gWyTBllAw/mobilebasic) It's a link from r/curlyhair and lists products that are green-lit in terms of ingredients. \n\nIf you don't have curly hair, then this is still probably a good routine to follow but if you do have curly hair then this will really help.",

It\u2019s good that you\u2019re not shampooing too often and instead using only conditioner in between, as excessive shampooing tends to cause hair to get brittle and damaged. A lot of the time greasy hair is the result of over-shampooing but you obviously aren\u2019t doing that, it could also be a transition to using less shampoo since your scalp hasn\u2019t \u201crealized\u201d you aren\u2019t shampooing as often anymore. About the dandruff though I don\u2019t know, in fact I\u2019m currently struggling with it myself, if it\u2019s getting severe you could try visiting a dermatologist. I hope I helped, and remember, no silicones, no sulfates",

It's not always logical because you can get an expensive one that has silicone and a cheap one that doesn't, so just be aware.\n\nBasically you need to get one without silicone because only sulphates clean silicone, so if you get silicone conditioner and a sulphate free shampoo then you're building up silicone and your hair will get greasy. Also sulphates are what dries out your hair and damages it so it's all-round bad.\n\nBut to be honest if you are getting conditioner without silicone then you don't need the shampoo, you can just co-wash.",

A lot of the time greasy hair is the result of over-shampooing but you obviously aren\u2019t doing that, it could also be a transition to using less shampoo since your scalp hasn\u2019t \u201crealized\u201d you aren\u2019t shampooing as often anymore. About the dandruff though I don\u2019t know, in fact I\u2019m currently struggling with it myself, if it\u2019s getting severe you could try visiting a dermatologist. I hope I helped, and remember, no silicones, no sulfates",

It's not always logical because you can get an expensive one that has silicone and a cheap one that doesn't, so just be aware.\n\nBasically you need to get one without silicone because only sulphates clean silicone, so if you get silicone conditioner and a sulphate free shampoo then you're building up silicone and your hair will get greasy. Also sulphates are what dries out your hair and damages it so it's all-round bad.\n\nBut to be honest if you are getting conditioner without silicone then you don't need the shampoo, you can just co-wash.",

So if your conditioner has silicone you are forced to use sulphate shampoo at some point or another.\n\nI don't use shampoo, I just wash my hair in silicone free conditioner and then reapply the same conditioner.

It\u2019s good that you\u2019re not shampooing too often and instead using only conditioner in between, as excessive shampooing tends to cause hair to get brittle and damaged. A lot of the time greasy hair is the result of over-shampooing but you obviously aren\u2019t doing that, it could also be a transition to using less shampoo since your scalp hasn\u2019t \u201crealized\u201d you aren\u2019t shampooing as often anymore. About the dandruff though I don\u2019t know, in fact I\u2019m currently struggling with it myself, if it\u2019s getting severe you could try visiting a dermatologist.
