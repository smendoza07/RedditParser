The Hope Bridge has been carrying out the \"2020 Emergency Relief Campaign for Flood Damage\" since July 24 to help flood victims affected by the recent torrential rains.\n\nKim Jong-kook reportedly donated 50 million won to Hope Bridge without his agency knowing that he would help neighbors affected by the sudden natural disaster.\n\nKim Jong-kook has continued to practice his love for neighbors by donating 100 million won to Hope Bridge in February this year, when the new coronavirus infection spread rapidly.\n\nStarting with broadcaster Yoo Jae-seok's donation of 100 million won on Thursday, stars such as trot singer Jang Yoon-jung and actor Song Joong-ki joined the \"2020 Emergency Relief Campaign for Flood Damage\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CDdhzTLgkGo/",
