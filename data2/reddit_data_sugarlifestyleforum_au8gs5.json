    "body": "If you receive a suspicious message from someone you've never met offering to send you large sums of money please proceed with caution.\n\nThe message might've been sent by an individual attempting advance-fee fraud, also called the \u201c419 scam.\u201d\n\n**What to look out for**\n\nIn combination, the following characteristics may indicate that you're dealing with a scammer:\n\n**Does he/she:**\n\n* Use odd phrases, or strange formatting in the conversation? \n\n* Offer to send you more money than you are asking for? This is known as an overpayment scam and is described under How the Scam Appears below. \n\n* Say they are a traveling businessperson, an oceanographer, out of the country, want to start providing for you before you meet or away at sea? \n\n* Insist you reply via a personal email address, off of SA or whatever site they originally contacted you on? A SD/SM who immediately insists on communicating off of site may be questionable. \n\n* Seem to not have read or looked at your profile, based on their vague questions? \n\n* Insist on sending you a check, your bank login information, your credit card login information, or offers you their bank account information to pay off debt, etc.\n\n* Asks you to send some of the money to someone else. An employee, charity, etc before the money has cleared. \n\n* Asks you to purchase gift cards and give him/her the code on the back before the money has cleared. \n\n* Wants to put you on his/her payroll. \n\n**How the scam appears**\n\nThe scammer will attempt to convince you to accept a fake payment for more than the allowance amount you initially agreed to/was offered by him/her. If they are successful, the scammer will get the money/or gift card value. In nearly every case, the con artist will not be caught.\n\n**Here's an example of how the scam can play out:**\n\nYou get the attention of a 419 scammer. They offer you an allowance amount with no request to meet up, excuse why they can't now, or an online arrangement. They tell you an allowance amount that is too good to be true, $1,000 a week but then sends you $1,800. They want you to send the extra money to someone else via Western Union, Money Gram, etc, because they can't right now(even though they just sent some to you). Or they want you to purchase itune, amazon, google play gift cards and send them the number on the back.\n\nYou deposit the $1,800 into your bank and then spend $800 doing the favors for the scammer. Or pay off your credit card with the info they gave you and used the card to make gift card purchases for the scammer. The scammer counts on you doing this before the check officially clears your bank account. This window between deposit and processing is known as \u201cfloat time\u201d and can last seven days, ten days, or even longer if the payment is international. During this time the money can be transferred, but it has not been verified by your bank as real. \n\nOnce the payment is processed, your bank will determine that it is fake. They will take the entire $1,800 back from you. Since you will have already spent the $800 for the scammer, you must repay the bank $800 of your own money. If you have spent any of the $1,000 you thought you earned, you will also need to replace that. In the case of the credit card you will owe the full balance you thought was payed off plus any purchases you made on behalf of the scammer. \n  \n\n**Why does this scam work?**\n\nThese scammers typically create multiple accounts on dating and social media sites and send the same message  to many different people with little or no personalization. The scammer's messages are meant to trigger greed and over ride common sense.\n\nThe scammer\u2019s payment is a forgery. It is not real!  Your bank may allow you to deposit it, or your credit card might say payment received but the payment will not clear. Your bank will hold you responsible for the entire amount.\n\nIn the case of a PayPal payment, the scammer will either send a fake PayPal confirmation email or pay with a fraudulent payment source. Whether you return the \u201coverpayment\u201d via PayPal or a wire transfer service such as Western Union or Money Gram, you will still be held responsible for all of the money involved.\n\nRemember: Money sent back to the scammer is money which is lost forever.\n\n**What you should do**\n\n* Do not respond to the messages. Don't engage these scammers for any reason. Responding will encourage the scammers and cause you to receive further scam messages.\n\n* Report the account messaging you if that is an option. \n\n* If you've already given out your personal login information contact your bank immediately and let them know you believe your account may be compromised. Follow their security protocols for securing your account. \n\n* If you've already sent money or gift cards, still contact your bank but you're pretty much screwed. You'll owe the money spent even if it was an empty account created especially for this purpose. And you may have your accounts shutdown for fraudulent activities or owe additional fees.\n\n**Other scams:**\n\n\n* He asks you anything about your bank account -- the account number so that he can do a transfer, the bank, or the username/password\n\n* He wants you to pick up a vanilla card or any sort of reloadable visa card or gift card\n\n* He wants to put you on the payroll or otherwise pay you through his business\n\n* He wants to send you a check or picture of a check to deposit\n\n* He wants to send you a payment but wants you to send back some of it in the form of a gift card or any other way, or to send some on to a different account\n\n* He wants you to install \"blockchain\"\n\n* He can only do mobile deposit (he'll have some story as to why -- venmo has given him trouble, he's gotten ripped off through paypal, etc)\n\n* He can only send allowance through some obscure mechanism -- bitcoin, blockchain, discovery account, etc. The mechanism itself will change, it's the fact that he's picked one this one mechanism that is not cash, that you need to look for\n\n* He wants your login info for any currency transfer app or mechanism\n\n* He has not met you yet, or gotten any value from the relationship at all, but he wants to transfer large sums to you or pay off your credit cards or loans\n\n* He gives you his credit card or bank account # and tells you to use them or transfer money out of them\n\n* He's looking for platonic, but wants to send large sums to you\n\n* He wants to use you as his personal assistant, he'll send money to you, and your job will be to pass that money on to others\n\n* He'll start sending you a large allowance, but you need to send him a little money first to verify you are real and establish trust (any \"prove you are real\" \"prove you are serious\" obligation is a scam)\n\n* You need to pay money, for any reason whatsoever, in order to collect your allowance\n\n* He sends you pics of documents that would completely compromise him and his security (e.g., his DL, his Passport) in advance\n\n* He pretends to try to use an app to send money, then shows you screenshots of how it failed, in order to manipulate you into using his transfer method of choice (usually credit or gift card, or pic of check)\n\n* He's going to pay you an allowance but allowance won't start until the middle or end of the month (he's going to collect his month of free sex and then ghost)\n\n* You're a male SB and an SM who you have never met wants to send you money\n\n\n**Could be a scam:**\n\n* It's the very beginning of an arrangement and he wants to use venmo, cashapp, or paypal instead of cash, to send you allowance (this is not a red flag if sending a smaller symbolic gift). Despite popular belief, all three of those are reversible. Cash is best at the beginning.\n\n* Man claiming to be an SD randomly approaches you on Instagram (nearly all instagram stories end up being scams). SD emphasizes he wants some combination of loyalty, trust, honesty: very common reverse psychology ploy, before the scam starts, and a common element of the scammer script.\n\n* She wants you to venmo money before the M&G (to pay for gas, or her nails, etc) or due to a sudden crisis (e.g., flat tire)\n\n* She wants you to send her money before you've met, and/or as a condition of meeting, to \"prove you're serious\"\n\n* She has a crisis (family emergency, a bill to pay) and needs you to send her money, before you've ever met\n\n* She requires you give her the full allowance or PPM at the beginning of the date (e.g., when she gets to the restaurant) rather than when you get to the room\n\n\nThe rules change once you're in an established arrangement and have earned trust. The rules are slightly different in non-US countries also, where some forms of bank transfer are safer... but still, it makes little sense not to start with cash, which is safe.",

They rely on basic human traits that we all possess. Greed (not necessarily positive, but most people do possess it), desperation, fear, and trust being the most common. How many people don't realize a check \"clearing\" does not actually mean the money has cleared? I've taken informal polls in person and almost no one realizes that.\n\nI'm not talking about being annoyed by people not searching before asking a question. That is justified annoyance. I am talking about criticizing someone for \"not knowing better\". \n\nSo if you're reading this and one of the people that look down on those that fall for scams, I hope it at least gives you pause and starts to change your mind.

So I figured I would do it, as this was his offering to build trust before I travel out of state to see him.

If this payment is reversed, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be on the hook for going *over* my credit limit!)\n\nNow I\u2019m terrified I fucked up by making the payment though I have proof via text that it\u2019s something else.

(I\u2019m new to credit building so this was very high for me!) I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s variation across different methods of checking the score, but my other major credit card reports through someone else. My score as shown by that company is now 630. Because I just set up the credit check though, I don\u2019t know if it was higher or a variation thing. My mom and partner who have authorization to use my card(s) don\u2019t have a drop in score, though. I was told authorizing them would bind the credit scores.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that I went to school for Accounting, yet here I am. Ironic.\n\nEdit: listed 650 instead of 630",

Have you figured out any safe ways to digitally receive sugar?\n\nedit: If you've read this far and are in a similar scenario, it's a scam. Definitely call your bank ASAP.\nThe check will appear to go through but then a week and some days later you'll learn it's bounced. inspect the check very closely/ You'll probably notice a few warning signs like that the bank is not located anywhere near where the SD claims to be located or is from an organization that has enough oversight such that this would never realistically happen.\nThe funds you received will be rescinded. The account sending you the funds is likely compromised & the legitimate account owner is likely owed a warning. In hindsight the level of absurdity the increasingly desperate scam reached is kinda amusing. They had a fake FBI agent text me from another account after I wised up but they accidentally got their fake names mixed up",

So I figured I would do it, as this was his offering to build trust before I travel out of state to see him.

If this payment is reversed, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be on the hook for going *over* my credit limit!)\n\nNow I\u2019m terrified I fucked up by making the payment though I have proof via text that it\u2019s something else.

Don\u2019t feel bad or discouraged. Answering your questions:\n\n- I had $570 of a $1,000 balance available, I now have $0 available and am paying off the amount I had used plus the bounced payment fee\n\n- I have accounts with two other major credit companies and two stores, so I don\u2019t plan to open another account right now because that will show me as seeking too actively\n\n- The app for that specific card would report my credit score, it was last 680. (I\u2019m new to credit building so this was very high for me!) I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s variation across different methods of checking the score, but my other major credit card reports through someone else. My score as shown by that company is now 630. Because I just set up the credit check though, I don\u2019t know if it was higher or a variation thing. My mom and partner who have authorization to use my card(s) don\u2019t have a drop in score, though.

I realized that even if the account information I've received is genuinely hers; I don't know how to go about legally using it to pay off my credit card. Do you? Surely there must be some sort of paperwork that must be done. \n\nI never knew these payments where reversible until this post. Have you figured out any safe ways to digitally receive sugar?\n\nedit: If you've read this far and are in a similar scenario, it's a scam. Definitely call your bank ASAP.\nThe check will appear to go through but then a week and some days later you'll learn it's bounced. inspect the check very closely/ You'll probably notice a few warning signs like that the bank is not located anywhere near where the SD claims to be located or is from an organization that has enough oversight such that this would never realistically happen.\nThe funds you received will be rescinded. The account sending you the funds is likely compromised & the legitimate account owner is likely owed a warning. In hindsight the level of absurdity the increasingly desperate scam reached is kinda amusing. They had a fake FBI agent text me from another account after I wised up but they accidentally got their fake names mixed up",

Never struggling to the point of desperation is not a SD exclusive trait after all.\n\nAlternatively it could be the attitude of \"well, I did it so anyone can\" which is slightly better, but still a very narrow view that assumes their situation and opportunities were similar enough to be comparable.

Answering your questions:\n\n- I had $570 of a $1,000 balance available, I now have $0 available and am paying off the amount I had used plus the bounced payment fee\n\n- I have accounts with two other major credit companies and two stores, so I don\u2019t plan to open another account right now because that will show me as seeking too actively\n\n- The app for that specific card would report my credit score, it was last 680. (I\u2019m new to credit building so this was very high for me!) I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s variation across different methods of checking the score, but my other major credit card reports through someone else. My score as shown by that company is now 630. Because I just set up the credit check though, I don\u2019t know if it was higher or a variation thing. My mom and partner who have authorization to use my card(s) don\u2019t have a drop in score, though. I was told authorizing them would bind the credit scores.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that I went to school for Accounting, yet here I am. Ironic.\n\nEdit: listed 650 instead of 630",

I realized that even if the account information I've received is genuinely hers; I don't know how to go about legally using it to pay off my credit card. Do you? Surely there must be some sort of paperwork that must be done. \n\nI never knew these payments where reversible until this post. Have you figured out any safe ways to digitally receive sugar?\n\nedit: If you've read this far and are in a similar scenario, it's a scam. Definitely call your bank ASAP.\nThe check will appear to go through but then a week and some days later you'll learn it's bounced. inspect the check very closely/ You'll probably notice a few warning signs like that the bank is not located anywhere near where the SD claims to be located or is from an organization that has enough oversight such that this would never realistically happen.\nThe funds you received will be rescinded. The account sending you the funds is likely compromised & the legitimate account owner is likely owed a warning. In hindsight the level of absurdity the increasingly desperate scam reached is kinda amusing. They had a fake FBI agent text me from another account after I wised up but they accidentally got their fake names mixed up",

Answering your questions:\n\n- I had $570 of a $1,000 balance available, I now have $0 available and am paying off the amount I had used plus the bounced payment fee\n\n- I have accounts with two other major credit companies and two stores, so I don\u2019t plan to open another account right now because that will show me as seeking too actively\n\n- The app for that specific card would report my credit score, it was last 680. (I\u2019m new to credit building so this was very high for me!) I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s variation across different methods of checking the score, but my other major credit card reports through someone else. My score as shown by that company is now 630. Because I just set up the credit check though, I don\u2019t know if it was higher or a variation thing. My mom and partner who have authorization to use my card(s) don\u2019t have a drop in score, though. I was told authorizing them would bind the credit scores.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that I went to school for Accounting, yet here I am. Ironic.\n\nEdit: listed 650 instead of 630",
