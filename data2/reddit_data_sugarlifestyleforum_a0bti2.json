    "body": "A woman tried being a sugar baby for the first time, was raped in a vile way, and was given fake money in an envelope.  She shared her story on TwoX, got mild support and negative feedback, and ended up deleting the post.\n\nI've been frequenting SLF for so long that I forgot how other people consider sugaring: almost universal condemnation and very little actual knowledge of what it entails.  And I think that the absence of knowledge and transparency makes it way more dangerous than it should be while allowing predators to run free.  It's a pretty shitty situation.\n\nSo thank you SLFers for keeping this subreddit alive and spreading the knowledge!",

That's super low. Now that you bring up Tinder though, I can start to see why this is happening... It just hit me.\n\nLittle story time...\nMy best friend was on Tinder looking for a date or hooking up. Got tired of getting no matches or replies, so he started adding the girls who put their snap/IG and said \"add me.\" That's where things got bad. These girls would pretend they were interested, lead him on, say they're going to meet him for a date, and asked for money up front. One had the excuse she needed gas money to go meet him, another convinced him she wanted to make p0rn together and had him sign up for a website that was supposedly \"free\" but needed his CC info... it ended up charging his card. These girls never showed for the meetups and even blocked him so he couldn't report or do anything about it. I told him he never should've given money to people he's never met, but he explained he was just so desperate and not thinking straight and believed them. I was pissed at these girls using him and seeing my best friend I care about deeply spiraling into depression and self destruction because of it. \n\nFor the people like that, who are out there preying on and scamming vulnerable people, I hope they get reported. What they're doing is dirty & dishonest. It makes me so mad. But for the gals who are delivering on their promise and holding up their end of agreements, they don't deserve this at all. It's just that, unfortunately the scammers seem to be ruining things for everyone else once again. I'm guessing enough people got scammed that they assume every girl asking for money for something is scamming.",

I assume many other cam girl companies do this as well. But these idiots are targeting any woman in the sex industry, posting it on hate subreddits like thotaudit, and trying to get others to mass report women to LE or the IRS, who they aren't even sure are reporting or evading. It's especially funny to watch them try to report non-US cam models on the grounds of \"Snapchat is U.S. based so they're evading taxes here.\"\n\nBut yeah, it's totally about the tax evasion and not about the fact that they're incel misogynists. \n\n",

That's super low. Now that you bring up Tinder though, I can start to see why this is happening... It just hit me.\n\nLittle story time...\nMy best friend was on Tinder looking for a date or hooking up. Got tired of getting no matches or replies, so he started adding the girls who put their snap/IG and said \"add me.\" That's where things got bad. These girls would pretend they were interested, lead him on, say they're going to meet him for a date, and asked for money up front. One had the excuse she needed gas money to go meet him, another convinced him she wanted to make p0rn together and had him sign up for a website that was supposedly \"free\" but needed his CC info... it ended up charging his card. These girls never showed for the meetups and even blocked him so he couldn't report or do anything about it. I told him he never should've given money to people he's never met, but he explained he was just so desperate and not thinking straight and believed them. I was pissed at these girls using him and seeing my best friend I care about deeply spiraling into depression and self destruction because of it. \n\nFor the people like that, who are out there preying on and scamming vulnerable people, I hope they get reported. What they're doing is dirty & dishonest. It makes me so mad. But for the gals who are delivering on their promise and holding up their end of agreements, they don't deserve this at all. It's just that, unfortunately the scammers seem to be ruining things for everyone else once again. I'm guessing enough people got scammed that they assume every girl asking for money for something is scamming.",

But these idiots are targeting any woman in the sex industry, posting it on hate subreddits like thotaudit, and trying to get others to mass report women to LE or the IRS, who they aren't even sure are reporting or evading. It's especially funny to watch them try to report non-US cam models on the grounds of \"Snapchat is U.S. based so they're evading taxes here.\"\n\nBut yeah, it's totally about the tax evasion and not about the fact that they're incel misogynists. \n\n",

Now that you bring up Tinder though, I can start to see why this is happening... It just hit me.\n\nLittle story time...\nMy best friend was on Tinder looking for a date or hooking up. Got tired of getting no matches or replies, so he started adding the girls who put their snap/IG and said \"add me.\" That's where things got bad. These girls would pretend they were interested, lead him on, say they're going to meet him for a date, and asked for money up front. One had the excuse she needed gas money to go meet him, another convinced him she wanted to make p0rn together and had him sign up for a website that was supposedly \"free\" but needed his CC info... it ended up charging his card. These girls never showed for the meetups and even blocked him so he couldn't report or do anything about it. I told him he never should've given money to people he's never met, but he explained he was just so desperate and not thinking straight and believed them. I was pissed at these girls using him and seeing my best friend I care about deeply spiraling into depression and self destruction because of it. \n\nFor the people like that, who are out there preying on and scamming vulnerable people, I hope they get reported. What they're doing is dirty & dishonest. It makes me so mad. But for the gals who are delivering on their promise and holding up their end of agreements, they don't deserve this at all. It's just that, unfortunately the scammers seem to be ruining things for everyone else once again. I'm guessing enough people got scammed that they assume every girl asking for money for something is scamming.",
