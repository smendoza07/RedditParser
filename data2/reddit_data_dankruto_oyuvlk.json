They don't have to be as long, or even half as long, but it was super good and well made and really put fairytail in a new perspective for most people. Not me because I haven't watched the show yet when I watched the video, and I was only half paying attention because I was playing fortnite with the boys (didn't have a choice in the matter) so I didn't get spoiled for anything either.
