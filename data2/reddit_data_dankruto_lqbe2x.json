Sasuke utilizing his Rinnegan and Sharingan multiple times.\nA showdown between Kyubi and Susanoo and one with both going ultra (although Sasukes was more impressive and it still kinda bugs me that Naruto equaled it with nature energy since he was charging for a few minutes).\n\nThen it had chakra less hand to hand combat that slowed down more and more until it ended with a final chidori rasengan showdown (and the only time Naruto did a normal Rasengan without a shadow clone I think).\nThe scene with all of the people close to Naruto adding to the Rasengan and on the other side a very subtle and barely seeable itachi giving Sasukes chidori power.\n\nThe lack of Music as well at some points added to the emotion.",
