    "body": "Well boys, I did it.  I managed to freestyle a new SB, *at a protest.* (I was there to protest; this was totally unplanned).  I believe this singular accomplishment makes up for my lifetime lack of muscles, looks, or a personality. I have officially transcended from sugar daddy, to super sugar daddy.  \n#\nI require a uniform that properly denotes my new deity like status.  It should be unisex, so that we can pass it around among SLF, based on who has done the latest and greatest boss move.  It will be like the Stanley Cup, except I am hoping fewer people will pee in this.  I am thinking, a nice full body latex suit with a little cape on the back.  Form fitting. Like... like painted on.  I want people who see me holding a cocktail to wonder if I am a man with a small penis, or a flat chested woman with a lumpy vagina, that's how snug this should be.  The only place it isn't form fitting is on the ass. I want some padding back there so my butt sticks out like a shelf.  You know, give me a place to set my drink down if I ever need my hands to fight crime or explain my yo-mama joke.\n#\nAlso, don't make it white. I know, I know, sugar is white. But... uh... sometimes I am kinda pale, and I am losing my hair, and my head is kinda pointy.  Um.  Pigmentally challenged individuals such as myself need to wear colors.  I am just saying:  If I see someone looking like the Klan, I am throwing hands first, and finding out it's a mirror later.  So... Green like money?",

She gave me hers, and I see her friday.  :)",
