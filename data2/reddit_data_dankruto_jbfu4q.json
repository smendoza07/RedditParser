Or why would you make something that can propel a small lead ball at 2000 feet per second when you can catch someone on fire by looking at them. Also population density seems to be extremely low in this universe so no modern looking buildings. All they really need is entertainment and communication. Cameras, TVs, and some way of communication like radio. It also would make sense that everything looks really old-styled because it seems when your entire history is based on \u201cmagic\u201d of some sorts that\u2019s ages old, your society would be really culture rich, so it would make sense that they don\u2019t modernize",

Or why would you make something that can propel a small lead ball at 2000 feet per second when you can catch someone on fire by looking at them. Also population density seems to be extremely low in this universe so no modern looking buildings. All they really need is entertainment and communication. Cameras, TVs, and some way of communication like radio. It also would make sense that everything looks really old-styled because it seems when your entire history is based on \u201cmagic\u201d of some sorts that\u2019s ages old, your society would be really culture rich, so it would make sense that they don\u2019t modernize",
