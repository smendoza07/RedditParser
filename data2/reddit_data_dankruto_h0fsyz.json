But then you can argue that the Leaf has grown many many times now, even having it's bustling skyscraper section in the UpTown.\n\nPlus logically, the most important post of the village will be pretty intensive as well. Not gonna be a chill ride. It does say that the two's relation were a lot closer before whilst Kakashi still was the hokage, which also makes sense. \n\nSensically, it can go either way. Naruto is an incredible Ninja, but his intellect doesn't really carry over to other aspects. Minato was an all around intelligent person, so possible that he had an easier time understanding and doing all the administration part of the hokage post.\n\nIf the Scenario A)Where Naruto perfectly balances his hokage duties with his family time is likely, the scenario B)Where Naruto is not able to balance his duties with his family life is even more likely, because not being perfect is a more likely scenario. But ofcourse OG Naruto peeps like Naruto having his perfect plot armor no-jutsu. Bet he can't talk-no-jutsu Himawari XD.",

And while the mental power would still be used, it would be far less damaging as he now has far more time to relax and be active. \n\nThis isn't even accounting that kind of mental strain should be almost irrelevant.\n\nHere's are a [few panels from the manga](https://preview.redd.it/1me4oab7uyl21.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e743d20440095674c1a49e3ff9e7fa7e2ea35ba).    \nThat's 200 days of experience being crammed in his head all at once. And he's still ready to go on for more training. Chakra control is also an extensive mental task that requires a ton of concentration. \n\nI'd say Naruto's mental fortitude is far better than the Boruto sorry would like to suggest.",

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

Yet, Sasuke still has his, but in a very weakened state I guess. Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

But then you can argue that the Leaf has grown many many times now, even having it's bustling skyscraper section in the UpTown.\n\nPlus logically, the most important post of the village will be pretty intensive as well. Not gonna be a chill ride. It does say that the two's relation were a lot closer before whilst Kakashi still was the hokage, which also makes sense. \n\nSensically, it can go either way. Naruto is an incredible Ninja, but his intellect doesn't really carry over to other aspects. Minato was an all around intelligent person, so possible that he had an easier time understanding and doing all the administration part of the hokage post.\n\nIf the Scenario A)Where Naruto perfectly balances his hokage duties with his family time is likely, the scenario B)Where Naruto is not able to balance his duties with his family life is even more likely, because not being perfect is a more likely scenario. But ofcourse OG Naruto peeps like Naruto having his perfect plot armor no-jutsu. Bet he can't talk-no-jutsu Himawari XD.",

And while the mental power would still be used, it would be far less damaging as he now has far more time to relax and be active. \n\nThis isn't even accounting that kind of mental strain should be almost irrelevant.\n\nHere's are a [few panels from the manga](https://preview.redd.it/1me4oab7uyl21.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e743d20440095674c1a49e3ff9e7fa7e2ea35ba).    \nThat's 200 days of experience being crammed in his head all at once. And he's still ready to go on for more training. Chakra control is also an extensive mental task that requires a ton of concentration. \n\nI'd say Naruto's mental fortitude is far better than the Boruto sorry would like to suggest.",

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

Yet, Sasuke still has his, but in a very weakened state I guess. Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

But then you can argue that the Leaf has grown many many times now, even having it's bustling skyscraper section in the UpTown.\n\nPlus logically, the most important post of the village will be pretty intensive as well. Not gonna be a chill ride. It does say that the two's relation were a lot closer before whilst Kakashi still was the hokage, which also makes sense. \n\nSensically, it can go either way. Naruto is an incredible Ninja, but his intellect doesn't really carry over to other aspects. Minato was an all around intelligent person, so possible that he had an easier time understanding and doing all the administration part of the hokage post.\n\nIf the Scenario A)Where Naruto perfectly balances his hokage duties with his family time is likely, the scenario B)Where Naruto is not able to balance his duties with his family life is even more likely, because not being perfect is a more likely scenario. But ofcourse OG Naruto peeps like Naruto having his perfect plot armor no-jutsu. Bet he can't talk-no-jutsu Himawari XD.",

And while the mental power would still be used, it would be far less damaging as he now has far more time to relax and be active. \n\nThis isn't even accounting that kind of mental strain should be almost irrelevant.\n\nHere's are a [few panels from the manga](https://preview.redd.it/1me4oab7uyl21.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e743d20440095674c1a49e3ff9e7fa7e2ea35ba).    \nThat's 200 days of experience being crammed in his head all at once. And he's still ready to go on for more training. Chakra control is also an extensive mental task that requires a ton of concentration. \n\nI'd say Naruto's mental fortitude is far better than the Boruto sorry would like to suggest.",

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her.

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

Yet, Sasuke still has his, but in a very weakened state I guess. Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

Yet, Sasuke still has his, but in a very weakened state I guess. Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

The fight was super clean, animation fire, etc. However, realistically Sasuke and Naruto should have been able to solo M ok yoshiki without breaking a sweat. The biggest reason is that Naruto should be roughly as strong as the Ten Tails by himself. He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto. Honestly, I think they nerfed them for LoLs at this point.",

Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

He has an enormousamount of chakra on his own, then you add Kurama's and the rest of the tailed beasts that bestowed their chakra to Naruto. So chakra wise, Naruto has more chakra than anyone else in the series UK p until the last power up Madara got and then Kaguya. Sasuke may have chakra issues, but he more than makes up for that deficit with technique and intellect. Not only that, most of Sasuke's chakra issues comes from him never going into a fight fresh. He always had a previous fight or previously used his space-time teleportation which takes up a large amount of chakra. Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB. However, as soon as you take away his absorption mechanic, he becomes much easier to beat. He even took half of Naruto's nerfed chakra and still lost to them before Doctor Dimwit came and fucked it all up. Essentially, Momoshiki was fodder compared to Kaguya.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nKaguya was weaker than AND feared Isshiki. Yet, Kaguya was stronger than Isshiki in the fight between her and Sasuke+Naruto.

I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",

Momoshiki, however, only has his chakra absorption and the ability to expel that chakra as the jutsu he absorbed or as raw power similar to a TBB.

            "body": "Same, he even took away Naruto's Sage power. Atleast so far. Yet, Sasuke still has his, but in a very weakened state I guess. Naruto should be able to do everything he did in the fight against Madara, Kaguya and Sasuke at the end of the series. The only thing they lost were the seasl on their palms that were used for the sealing jutsu for Kaguya. I'm guessing Kishimoto meant for that to happen to take away their ability to seal the future Otsutsuki. I meant, Kaguya was the Ten Tail Jinchuriki AND had all of the powers from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from the great tree. She was 100x more power than Momoshiki in the state they fought her. Yet, they barely beat Momoshiki, the guy who's only trick was absorbing chakra, which they had already faced a beat that ability several times before.",
