He grew up abandoned and alone, with no one to love him. The first person to acknowledge him was a teacher. Naruto loved Iruka, but it was a very different type of love than the romantic kind. He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

He grew up abandoned and alone, with no one to love him. The first person to acknowledge him was a teacher. Naruto loved Iruka, but it was a very different type of love than the romantic kind. He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

The first person to acknowledge him was a teacher. Naruto loved Iruka, but it was a very different type of love than the romantic kind. He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

The first person to acknowledge him was a teacher. Naruto loved Iruka, but it was a very different type of love than the romantic kind. He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

The first person to acknowledge him was a teacher. Naruto loved Iruka, but it was a very different type of love than the romantic kind. He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",

The first person to acknowledge him was a teacher. Naruto loved Iruka, but it was a very different type of love than the romantic kind. He didn't know how to feel, so he fell back on his old habits, which was to shove his feelings deep down inside.\n\nAfter Naruto confronted those feelings in the spirit waterfall, he and Hinata do share a few moments that hint that Naruto *does* feel something towards her, but they're in the middle of life or death battles when these moments happen.\n\nI think that's why Kishimoto made the movie canon, cause he knew he dropped the ball and needed them to share some interactions that aren't in mid combat.",
