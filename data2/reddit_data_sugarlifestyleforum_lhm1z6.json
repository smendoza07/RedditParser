    "body": "i guess i\u2019ll try to give some background. i\u2019m currently in university and i was looking for something that would make money fast, so i became a sugar baby. i\u2019ve been sugaring for the past three months, and i met a new guy a few days ago. it was our first time meeting, and based off the few chats we had beforehand he seemed normal, decent. he\u2019s a doctor and has a wife who he\u2019s only staying with for the sake of his toddler. i thought that as man who has a child and a respectable profession he would be safe to be with. i now realize the logic behind that is completely flawed after what happened to me. \n\ni met him and we agreed that we could become intimate afterward at a hotel he\u2019d booked. obviously, i told him beforehand over our chats that if i felt uncomfortable i would tell him and he would have to stop, and he wouldn\u2019t have to compensate me in any way. things started to get heated and once he started to fuck me he was very rough. it was very painful, and i\u2019ve never experienced that sort of pain during sex. i tried to bear it for a few minutes but i couldn\u2019t. i asked him if he could slow down, and he told me that since i\u2019m a \u201cwhore i should be able to take it.\u201d he only got more rough, and i begged him to stop. it was too painful. he didn\u2019t. once he finished, i was crying and asked him why he didn\u2019t stop and he told me \u201cwhy should i stop if this is your job?\u201d i felt so sick. i think he eventually became panicked and realized i was being serious when i told him to stop so instead of giving me what he was supposed to, he gave me five times more. he told me that we have an \u201cunderstanding\u201dthat i can\u2019t tell anyone. i ran out of there and i\u2019ve locked myself in my apartment since. i haven\u2019t eaten in days, and i have no motivation to attend classes. \n\nmy parents obviously have no idea i\u2019m sugaring. they are conservative muslims and would probably never speak to me again if they found out, especially since i really don\u2019t have any reason to be sugaring. my dad pays almost all of my expenses, so i just can\u2019t tell them what happened bc they just won\u2019t understand. i only got into sugaring since i thought it would be thrilling and fun. it turned out to be the exact opposite. i\u2019m not sure what to do. any advice is appreciated.",

If you're able I would take a victim advocate with you and file a police report, you don't necessarily need to press charges but you may change your mind about that later and a statement now is important.  Back up any texts you sent to friends/supports after the attack as these are also evidence.  You could also report this man to his college (his professional regulating body); he is a predator and has no business working as a physician.  Seek out counseling resources at your uni as soon as you're ready, it can be super helpful having someone safe and non-judegmental to talk to.\n\nI'm very sorry this happened to you, it was not your fault, there was no \"understanding\" this man is a rapist and is trying to gaslight you.  The money has no bearing on your consent.  Professional sex workers can revoke consent at any moment.

They can give you really helpful information about your options moving forward, whether that be to pursue something with the authorities or just focus on your mental health. For example, here's the a link to the service I used: https://www.monarchscc.org/\n\nThen of course, you can directly contact the authorities, but unfortunately, if you decide to go this route, you have to act quickly so they can get vital evidence for the investigation via a rape kit (they're terrible to get done, but can be really helpful in a court of law)\n\nAlso, no matter what you decide to do, definitely look into counseling via your college/school. They should have programs specifically designed to help women with mental health after sexual trauma or assault. The one at my college was called CARE if that helps at all.\n\nWhatever you do, don't bury this inside. It happened and it's absolutely terrible, but at the end of the day, counseling and talking your way through it will help a lot. You have a support group here on reddit if you ever need it. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions/need any more support! You are brave and strong and will overcome this!",

Please report him to whatever website you met him on. To the police too if you feel comfortable doing so, but that can be a whole mess and triggering. Police reporting can be nice to have a buddy with you. idk if they do rape kits where you are, but that situation can be retraumatizing for many.\n\nPlease take care of yourself as best you can. I've been assaulted a few times, and my biggest mistakes were not acknowledging how much it affected me.

This is not okay, but it is a reality in a lot of cases that a woman has to be so strong to make that report in the first place and it ends up being the one hurt the most when the system fails her. As women we have to be realistic and find the right decision for ourselves knowing that reporting a sex crime is a difficult path and justice is not guaranteed. I say this as someone who did report my rapist but found no justice. Sadly there is not an easy answer and in some cases the victim needs to make a decision if she will feel empowered by reporting the crime or just immeasurably more pained by the legal process.",

I would recommend therapy but if insurance / cost in a concern then if comfortable try opening up to a trusted person and using peer support.\n\nThe one thing I regret in my case was not seeking help...even from my friends. I shut off for many years and thought something was wrong with me and it led to later issues that I still struggle with today. It\u2019s an up and down process. Some days will be better than others but I know you will be able to heal from this. Take time for yourself and maybe step away from sugaring and intimacy until you feel comfortable. \n\nI would report him but I also understand safety and confidentiality is a huge thing so I respect your decision no matter what. Just do what is best for you.\n\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Be safe.",

If you are in a country such as the US where prostitution is illegal I would not recommend this. You will be treated horribly and suffer more trauma. This is why it is important for young women who get into sugaring to understand that it IS sex work. Civilians make no distinction. For all the people, especially men, in the replies telling her to go to the police I hope you advocate for and financially support organizations that are fighting for the decriminalization of sex work. If we had decriminalization she could have gone to the police without fear if that was her choice. But unless she lives in New Zealand or a few other places that is not the case. I see so many people on platforms like TikTok selling a dream to young girls about sugaring when in reality it\u2019s very dangerous physically, mentally, and emotionally. Few would encourage an 18 year old to go work as an escort or as at a brothel. Anyone who thinks the risks are not the same sugaring is delusional. And I know plenty of SD love these sugaring sites so they can find an 18 year old they can victimize. What that man was saying to her as he raped her is important for people to pay attention to. This is what the reality is of how so many of these SDs view these women and how the police and many others will as well. It\u2019s disgusting but it\u2019s a reality that helps no one to deny. \nI\u2019m really sorry this happened to you. Please tell someone, a therapist or a hotline. Someone else suggested going to Planned Parenthood if you\u2019re in the states and I agree. They were very kind and helpful to me after a client stealthed and ejaculated in me (removed condom without my consent). Under decriminalization that\u2019s considered rape btw. \nAnd I would suggest you stop sugaring. You are too young and too inexperienced to be able to properly protect yourself from predators. And you\u2019ll never be able to fully, but at your age it\u2019s much harder.  Plus the worst men are seeking you out because of how young you are assuming they can take advantage of you. \nAgain, I am so sorry. This is not your fault. Get therapeutic help.

You\u2019re right to want to hurt him because it\u2019s what he deserves. He\u2019s a rapist. Period. But I do think that gentlemen such as yourself have no way of seeing really just how much of these sites are made up of men like this.  I have escorted and sugared and my years of experience is that there are men who see escorts, men who only seek out SB, and men who do both. The overlap is significant. My google contact list tells me so. And there are just as many predators on SD sites as escorting ones. So I encourage any younger SB to follow some experienced and smart FSSW on Twitter etc so they can learn better how to keep themselves safe. Because the tactics these predators use are similar, and these young women need skills to spot red flags, to screen, etc. They won\u2019t become \u201cjaded\u201d or \u201ctransactional\u201d by knowing how to stay safe. Actually the exact opposite. Safety will allow them to remain happy and fun. And sadly even after learning safety techniques it\u2019s not a guarantee of safety, and that is something they need to know before going into sugaring.\nYes you can meet wonderful men and make real connections but the path to that end goal can be extremely dangerous. And the criminalization of sex work emboldens predators. I had a friend who was raped at gun point and the rapist mocked her inability to go to the police as he raped her.\nI am very sad for this young woman. I wish she had help and guidance. I wish she was free to peruse justice without fear. I hope she is able to get therapy and support for her trauma. And I wish her safety and peace for her future.",

I can see that when they were handing out the ability to create a well thought-out position you clearly had some better shit to do.  Sex ends when either party decides to end it, and that's not some difficult position to see.  It's the concensus of everyone with a developed sense of logic, dignity, and respect for their fellow human.\n\n\nJust entertain an example: You're having consensual sex, and have agreed to be tied up.  Before you've finished, you begin feeling intense unexplained pain in your genitals, it increases with every thrust. You ask your partner to stop.  By your own fucked argument, your partner would be well within their rights to just continue regardless of your pain, ad infinitum until you finish, and you'd have no choice but to sit through it, since you haven't finished and the sex hasn't ended.  \n\nIf anyone involved decides the sex needs to stop, and the sex doesn't stop, that's called rape.  Your argument is invalid.\n\n\nEdit:  Did I just make a rape apologist delete his account?  This may be my proudest moment on Reddit.",

As women we have to be realistic and find the right decision for ourselves knowing that reporting a sex crime is a difficult path and justice is not guaranteed. I say this as someone who did report my rapist but found no justice. Sadly there is not an easy answer and in some cases the victim needs to make a decision if she will feel empowered by reporting the crime or just immeasurably more pained by the legal process.",

He\u2019s a rapist. Period. But I do think that gentlemen such as yourself have no way of seeing really just how much of these sites are made up of men like this.  I have escorted and sugared and my years of experience is that there are men who see escorts, men who only seek out SB, and men who do both. The overlap is significant. My google contact list tells me so. And there are just as many predators on SD sites as escorting ones. So I encourage any younger SB to follow some experienced and smart FSSW on Twitter etc so they can learn better how to keep themselves safe. Because the tactics these predators use are similar, and these young women need skills to spot red flags, to screen, etc. They won\u2019t become \u201cjaded\u201d or \u201ctransactional\u201d by knowing how to stay safe. Actually the exact opposite. Safety will allow them to remain happy and fun. And sadly even after learning safety techniques it\u2019s not a guarantee of safety, and that is something they need to know before going into sugaring.\nYes you can meet wonderful men and make real connections but the path to that end goal can be extremely dangerous. And the criminalization of sex work emboldens predators. I had a friend who was raped at gun point and the rapist mocked her inability to go to the police as he raped her.\nI am very sad for this young woman. I wish she had help and guidance. I wish she was free to peruse justice without fear. I hope she is able to get therapy and support for her trauma. And I wish her safety and peace for her future.",

It\u2019s the delusion that it\u2019s not sex work. Well it is. The police will at best do nothing, will most likely say things to her that will traumatize and haunt her as bad as the rape, and at worst could assault her or arrest her.\nAnd if you think I am exaggerating I hope you\u2019ll do some research. Police are allowed in many states to legally have sex with women as part of prostitution stings. Police often use the threat of arrest to coerce sex (aka rape) women. \nShe needs to find a therapist not the police. And those of you suggesting she contact the cops need to wake up.

I can see that when they were handing out the ability to create a well thought-out position you clearly had some better shit to do.  Sex ends when either party decides to end it, and that's not some difficult position to see.  It's the concensus of everyone with a developed sense of logic, dignity, and respect for their fellow human.\n\n\nJust entertain an example: You're having consensual sex, and have agreed to be tied up.  Before you've finished, you begin feeling intense unexplained pain in your genitals, it increases with every thrust. You ask your partner to stop.  By your own fucked argument, your partner would be well within their rights to just continue regardless of your pain, ad infinitum until you finish, and you'd have no choice but to sit through it, since you haven't finished and the sex hasn't ended.  \n\nIf anyone involved decides the sex needs to stop, and the sex doesn't stop, that's called rape.  Your argument is invalid.\n\n\nEdit:  Did I just make a rape apologist delete his account?  This may be my proudest moment on Reddit.",

He\u2019s a rapist. Period. But I do think that gentlemen such as yourself have no way of seeing really just how much of these sites are made up of men like this.  I have escorted and sugared and my years of experience is that there are men who see escorts, men who only seek out SB, and men who do both. The overlap is significant. My google contact list tells me so. And there are just as many predators on SD sites as escorting ones. So I encourage any younger SB to follow some experienced and smart FSSW on Twitter etc so they can learn better how to keep themselves safe. Because the tactics these predators use are similar, and these young women need skills to spot red flags, to screen, etc. They won\u2019t become \u201cjaded\u201d or \u201ctransactional\u201d by knowing how to stay safe. Actually the exact opposite. Safety will allow them to remain happy and fun. And sadly even after learning safety techniques it\u2019s not a guarantee of safety, and that is something they need to know before going into sugaring.\nYes you can meet wonderful men and make real connections but the path to that end goal can be extremely dangerous. And the criminalization of sex work emboldens predators. I had a friend who was raped at gun point and the rapist mocked her inability to go to the police as he raped her.\nI am very sad for this young woman. I wish she had help and guidance. I wish she was free to peruse justice without fear. I hope she is able to get therapy and support for her trauma. And I wish her safety and peace for her future.",

I can see that when they were handing out the ability to create a well thought-out position you clearly had some better shit to do.  Sex ends when either party decides to end it, and that's not some difficult position to see.  It's the concensus of everyone with a developed sense of logic, dignity, and respect for their fellow human.\n\n\nJust entertain an example: You're having consensual sex, and have agreed to be tied up.  Before you've finished, you begin feeling intense unexplained pain in your genitals, it increases with every thrust. You ask your partner to stop.  By your own fucked argument, your partner would be well within their rights to just continue regardless of your pain, ad infinitum until you finish, and you'd have no choice but to sit through it, since you haven't finished and the sex hasn't ended.  \n\nIf anyone involved decides the sex needs to stop, and the sex doesn't stop, that's called rape.  Your argument is invalid.\n\n\nEdit:  Did I just make a rape apologist delete his account?  This may be my proudest moment on Reddit.",

I can see that when they were handing out the ability to create a well thought-out position you clearly had some better shit to do.  Sex ends when either party decides to end it, and that's not some difficult position to see.  It's the concensus of everyone with a developed sense of logic, dignity, and respect for their fellow human.\n\n\nJust entertain an example: You're having consensual sex, and have agreed to be tied up.  Before you've finished, you begin feeling intense unexplained pain in your genitals, it increases with every thrust. You ask your partner to stop.  By your own fucked argument, your partner would be well within their rights to just continue regardless of your pain, ad infinitum until you finish, and you'd have no choice but to sit through it, since you haven't finished and the sex hasn't ended.  \n\nIf anyone involved decides the sex needs to stop, and the sex doesn't stop, that's called rape.  Your argument is invalid.\n\n\nEdit:  Did I just make a rape apologist delete his account?  This may be my proudest moment on Reddit.",
