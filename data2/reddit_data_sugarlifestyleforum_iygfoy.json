    "body": "No, there isn't a sugar daddy out there for every gal who wants one. The lifestyle is purpose-built to cater to *some* measure of entitlement. If you're conventionally attractive, fit or slim, you will gain access to money. If you have money to spend, you'll gain access to conventionally attractive, fit or slim women for sex. You can say *conventionally attractive* is far too subjective but we all know what it looks like when you see it.\n\nNo amount of profile tweaking or photo angles will change the fact you're just not sugar baby material. While looks won't carry the day always, it is on the order of 80% of your success.\n\nAnd the sugar daddies? You've got to bring your A game too. You have to be able to make a plausible financial impact on a young woman's livelihood, and not just bargain down. Clean yourself up, dress sharp and appropriate. Be a gentleman on the town, give her the ride of her life in the bedroom. If you think money alone entitles you to a sugar baby, you too are doing this wrong.",

Yes there are those looking for arm candy. But remember that they will always be looking for slightly higher grade arm candy because their ego is at risk. \n\nWholesome, nice, intelligent, enjoys sex and will teach you what special things you need to know about pleasing her can be addicting in a world where 80% of sugar relationships fail  in less than a year.

Their time and energy is finite (and also only catering the the mega wealthy would be a financial drawback for a site like Seeking's long term profitability), so it's unlikely they'll curb the market.\n\nSeeking has their Diamond Membership for exactly this purpose, finding the mega rich. The challenge, I'd imagine, is mega wealthy men probably don't want their information out there for just anyone to find. \n\nSo, we live in a society and government that panders to the mega wealthy, and they continue to consolidate wealth while it continues to shrink for the rest of us.\n\nI think it's unfair to complain about the so-called \"average\" on the site. If a rich guy finds a homely/average looking SB attractive then maybe she has more to offer than just her physicality. Same goes for hot SBs.\n\nI've kinda been through many flavors of SB in my time on the site, from the super hot to the average looking. Ironically, some of the best sex, intimacy and connection I've had was with someone who was more middle of the road.\n\nBut that's the thing with attraction, and where I think some ladies (and guys, too) miss the boat. You can have the biggest ass, boobs, most symmetrical face or whatever the hell media and culture shoves down your throat as being \"hot\" and still fail at SR's. Why? I think it has to do with intention and stoking desire. Hard to do in a quick profile blurb in an oversaturated market, competing in a 5:1 Female to Male ratio. \n\nIf you want to capture a whale, you're gonna have to be as possessed as Captain Ahab. \n\nEither way, this is the community we have now.

I don\u2019t think they realize how difficult it really is to secure someone legitimate, and how many perfectly manicured women they\u2019re competing with. \n\nI\u2019ve now noticed the same type of advertising with OnlyFans, as if anyone can make a page and start earning five figure months. Yet, if you look on any newbie Onlyfans subs, tons of regular/average girls post about not being able to earn subscribers, not making any money, and they\u2019ve been posting nudes everywhere advertising for months. As mean as it sounds, this type of work is just not realistic or likely for someone who is average looking when there\u2019s so much other competition.\n\n95% of the men on the site need a reality check as well. I used the site 5+ years ago and boggles my mind how terribly low end it\u2019s all become now. I\u2019m in a relationship now and thankfully no longer on the hunt, but lurking these boards makes me feel bad for the few remaining who have to weed through so much nonsense to find a real old school SD/SB arrangement.",

While OP is absolutely true in the purest sense, there are always exceptions to the rule, and room to play within those exceptions. For example, a 34yo semi-attractive socially awkward SD who is unsuccessful at meeting women in regular life wants some sprinkles on his \"vanilla cookie\" he might take a dip in the bowl and come up with a snack. A curious attractive couple looking for a threesome may find a more sexually liberated and opportunistic individual in the bowl. A curvy cute post-prime lady may want to take a non-committal spin around town on someone else's tab, and settle for a few shiny trinkets vs having her rent relieved. There are obviously situations that are more or less plausible, and it makes sense to be realistic about it, which many of the problems arise from unrealistic expectations, but there will always be exceptions and margins to play in. \"Mutually beneficial\" comes in a rainbow of colors and flavors.",

She married a Sugar Typcoon that was 24 years older than her. She lovingly referred to him as her Sugar Daddy.\n\nBy the late 1920s any older wealthy man that dated a younger women and spoiled her with gifts was referred to a a sugar daddy.\n\nSugar relationships have always been much closer to vanilla relationships but with spoiling and financial assistance. It\u2019s only been in the last 10 years since Seeking coined the term arrangements did people start having no strings arrangements rather then sugar relationships.\n\nSo please get off your uneducated high horse.\n\nNo one is bashing sex work. It\u2019s a necessary service and should be legal. But please don\u2019t tell me that SW invented sugar relationships, because you would be sadly wrong.\n\nMaybe do a little research before you say something so outlandish",

Yes, you need to be decent but it's easier for SDs to find SBs generally than the other way around. For instance, I believe it's easier for (what many here will call) a \"salt daddy\" to find an SB than an SB to find an SD. Truth of the matter is, the ratio favors SDs and there are SBs that are completely happy with experiences or less ppm than average. I've run into a few and those relationships tended to be more fulfilling for me because their primary focus was not on money. I still ended up spending about the same as other SRs because of gifts and activities. The relationship was just more genuine and thoughtful.",

They're not doing this as a job, or a side hustle, or as some form of illegal means of making money.\n\nThe women with the lowest monetary requests turn out to be the best long-term sugar babies & sugar GF's. They want to spend more time with you because they genuinely like you, are attracted you to and want to have sex with you. They don't try to hustle you, or have extra requests, they dont try to upcharge for overnights, most of the time they're the ones that offer to stay the night.\n\nIn addition the women that had the least monetary requests are often the ones that get the most out of me. Because they are unassuming, undemanding, and give of their time so freely, it makes you want to spoil them more.",

I believe the women that treat sugar relationships like a job are the ones constantly searching for new SD, having to juggle multiple SD, because many of these guys that offer higher PPM are only seeing them once or twice a month, etc.\n\nWhereas a women that accepts a modest / average ppm or allowance tend to be the most gratuitous, and when they find a SD that actually wants a sugar relationship not a NSA arrangement they often end up getting more then the girl that wanted more ppm for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all for the consistency. the girl who accepts the modest allowance at half of what the girl that wants a high allowance  has a consistent SD for an entire year without getting any extras from her SD she will  have made more then the girl who is getting double with an inconsistent SD. Add in to the fact that more then likely the girl that wants the higher ppm will take at least twice as long to find a SD like that, then add to that more then likely she will be having shorter term arrangements that last 1-3 months so now there\u2019s more downtime between SD, now she has to pick up a 2nd SD that can only see her once a month when he\u2019s in town, the next thing you know she\u2019s juggling 2-3 SD, none of which are going to be longterm or consistent.\n\nThese types of women are constantly on Seeking. They\u2019re always looking for new SD. \n\nWhereas as the women looking for traditional SR with a more modest allowance end up in longterm 6 month - 2 year relationships. These women also get lots of extras on top of that modest allowance. Most of the time men like this buy them things they need that they can\u2019t afford, help them with unexpected bills, buy them clothes, and take them shopping.\n\nBasically because they have longterm in mind and offer so much they often get more. Whereas women that expect a lot often only get what was agreed too.\n\nOne last thing, to address your comment about why wouldn\u2019t they date just a rich boyfriend.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a few reasons.\n\n1. The average woman in college doesn\u2019t have access to a wealthy guy like that that they can Vanilla date, & even if they did, he\u2019s probably not going to be helping her financially like a SD would.\n\n2. She may not want a vanilla boyfriend while she\u2019s trying hard to focus on school & get her degree\n\n3. Many women on seeking actually are attracted to older men and actually want to date them\n\n4. Many women want to step outside the box that they normally live in and go on an adventure and do something they\u2019ve never tried before which is have a sugar relationship and date an older man just for the experience.\n\nI think what you\u2019re failing to realize, is you\u2019re only looking at sugar dating from your narrow minded view. Not all women are money focused when it comes to sugar relationships. Yes they all want money or some type of financial assistance, but a good majority of them look at the money as a benefit of the relationship, rather than looking at the relationship as something they have to do to get  money \ud83d\ude09",

These bratty 20 yos using SA like a prostitute mill make this like shooting fish in a barrel.  With their stupid false EVERYTHING.

The amount varies greatly as well along with the ease of finding someone.  I know a SB who was getting five figures per date but she was young, beautiful, good body, etc.  She didn\u2019t accept less and to be quite frank she shouldn\u2019t have.  The lifestyle a SB wants just depends on her.  In the end every girl can get what she want but some girls will take longer than others and will also need to temper their expectations",

Though yes I can understand how that could be read the other way.\n\nWell, I assumed basic hygiene was a given. The whole dress appropriately thing, op did say dress sharp. Not likely to happen with me.\n\nIs that dressing inappropriately? Well if its not something that requires formal attire, then you'd get casual. For all your protesting about clothing, I suspect if you met a hot guy off tinder, you wouldnt care if he showed up in a worn tanktop and shorts. I know that because when I was younger I was that guy in a tanktop and cargo pants, or whatever, and girls didnt give a damn what I wore. :p\n\nAlso, I didnt say I wouldnt make sex enjoyable, just that I doubt its a requirement. What I did say was\n\n>I enjoy sex, and put the effort in, but required? Nope.\n\nMy point being that a guy isnt even required to have sex, plenty of girls want platonic. So to say a guy has to? Eeeeh. There have been plenty of posts here by SBs who are not thrilled with their SDs sexual performance.\n\nThink of it this way. If OP had said, to be a SB you must paint your nails, wear lace underwear, and have an awesome purse, and a perform _ _ _ sex acts, and be hot you'd probably be like. Nope. You dont have to do that. Being hot is enough.\n\nAnd you'd be right. If a girl is fit/hot, I dont care about her nails, underwear, and I wouldnt care if she didnt want anal or something. Would all that be nice? Sure, but its not mandatory. Yup the relationship matters, the emotional connection matters, making sure everyone is happy matters, but in that whole description, being attractive is the only thing thats mandatory.",

Their time and energy is finite (and also only catering the the mega wealthy would be a financial drawback for a site like Seeking's long term profitability), so it's unlikely they'll curb the market.\n\nSeeking has their Diamond Membership for exactly this purpose, finding the mega rich. The challenge, I'd imagine, is mega wealthy men probably don't want their information out there for just anyone to find. \n\nSo, we live in a society and government that panders to the mega wealthy, and they continue to consolidate wealth while it continues to shrink for the rest of us.\n\nI think it's unfair to complain about the so-called \"average\" on the site. If a rich guy finds a homely/average looking SB attractive then maybe she has more to offer than just her physicality. Same goes for hot SBs.\n\nI've kinda been through many flavors of SB in my time on the site, from the super hot to the average looking. Ironically, some of the best sex, intimacy and connection I've had was with someone who was more middle of the road.\n\nBut that's the thing with attraction, and where I think some ladies (and guys, too) miss the boat. You can have the biggest ass, boobs, most symmetrical face or whatever the hell media and culture shoves down your throat as being \"hot\" and still fail at SR's. Why? I think it has to do with intention and stoking desire. Hard to do in a quick profile blurb in an oversaturated market, competing in a 5:1 Female to Male ratio. \n\nIf you want to capture a whale, you're gonna have to be as possessed as Captain Ahab. \n\nEither way, this is the community we have now. Personally, I'm cool with it. \ud83d\ude0a",

She married a Sugar Typcoon that was 24 years older than her. She lovingly referred to him as her Sugar Daddy.\n\nBy the late 1920s any older wealthy man that dated a younger women and spoiled her with gifts was referred to a a sugar daddy.\n\nSugar relationships have always been much closer to vanilla relationships but with spoiling and financial assistance. It\u2019s only been in the last 10 years since Seeking coined the term arrangements did people start having no strings arrangements rather then sugar relationships.\n\nSo please get off your uneducated high horse.\n\nNo one is bashing sex work. It\u2019s a necessary service and should be legal.

They're not doing this as a job, or a side hustle, or as some form of illegal means of making money.\n\nThe women with the lowest monetary requests turn out to be the best long-term sugar babies & sugar GF's. They want to spend more time with you because they genuinely like you, are attracted you to and want to have sex with you. They don't try to hustle you, or have extra requests, they dont try to upcharge for overnights, most of the time they're the ones that offer to stay the night.\n\nIn addition the women that had the least monetary requests are often the ones that get the most out of me. Because they are unassuming, undemanding, and give of their time so freely, it makes you want to spoil them more.",

I believe the women that treat sugar relationships like a job are the ones constantly searching for new SD, having to juggle multiple SD, because many of these guys that offer higher PPM are only seeing them once or twice a month, etc.\n\nWhereas a women that accepts a modest / average ppm or allowance tend to be the most gratuitous, and when they find a SD that actually wants a sugar relationship not a NSA arrangement they often end up getting more then the girl that wanted more ppm for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all for the consistency. the girl who accepts the modest allowance at half of what the girl that wants a high allowance  has a consistent SD for an entire year without getting any extras from her SD she will  have made more then the girl who is getting double with an inconsistent SD. Add in to the fact that more then likely the girl that wants the higher ppm will take at least twice as long to find a SD like that, then add to that more then likely she will be having shorter term arrangements that last 1-3 months so now there\u2019s more downtime between SD, now she has to pick up a 2nd SD that can only see her once a month when he\u2019s in town, the next thing you know she\u2019s juggling 2-3 SD, none of which are going to be longterm or consistent.\n\nThese types of women are constantly on Seeking. They\u2019re always looking for new SD. \n\nWhereas as the women looking for traditional SR with a more modest allowance end up in longterm 6 month - 2 year relationships. These women also get lots of extras on top of that modest allowance. Most of the time men like this buy them things they need that they can\u2019t afford, help them with unexpected bills, buy them clothes, and take them shopping.\n\nBasically because they have longterm in mind and offer so much they often get more. Whereas women that expect a lot often only get what was agreed too.\n\nOne last thing, to address your comment about why wouldn\u2019t they date just a rich boyfriend.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a few reasons.\n\n1. The average woman in college doesn\u2019t have access to a wealthy guy like that that they can Vanilla date, & even if they did, he\u2019s probably not going to be helping her financially like a SD would.\n\n2. She may not want a vanilla boyfriend while she\u2019s trying hard to focus on school & get her degree\n\n3. Many women on seeking actually are attracted to older men and actually want to date them\n\n4. Many women want to step outside the box that they normally live in and go on an adventure and do something they\u2019ve never tried before which is have a sugar relationship and date an older man just for the experience.\n\nI think what you\u2019re failing to realize, is you\u2019re only looking at sugar dating from your narrow minded view. Not all women are money focused when it comes to sugar relationships. Yes they all want money or some type of financial assistance, but a good majority of them look at the money as a benefit of the relationship, rather than looking at the relationship as something they have to do to get  money \ud83d\ude09",

For all your protesting about clothing, I suspect if you met a hot guy off tinder, you wouldnt care if he showed up in a worn tanktop and shorts. I know that because when I was younger I was that guy in a tanktop and cargo pants, or whatever, and girls didnt give a damn what I wore. :p\n\nAlso, I didnt say I wouldnt make sex enjoyable, just that I doubt its a requirement. What I did say was\n\n>I enjoy sex, and put the effort in, but required? Nope.\n\nMy point being that a guy isnt even required to have sex, plenty of girls want platonic. So to say a guy has to? Eeeeh. There have been plenty of posts here by SBs who are not thrilled with their SDs sexual performance.\n\nThink of it this way. If OP had said, to be a SB you must paint your nails, wear lace underwear, and have an awesome purse, and a perform _ _ _ sex acts, and be hot you'd probably be like. Nope. You dont have to do that. Being hot is enough.\n\nAnd you'd be right. If a girl is fit/hot, I dont care about her nails, underwear, and I wouldnt care if she didnt want anal or something. Would all that be nice? Sure, but its not mandatory. Yup the relationship matters, the emotional connection matters, making sure everyone is happy matters, but in that whole description, being attractive is the only thing thats mandatory.",

Their time and energy is finite (and also only catering the the mega wealthy would be a financial drawback for a site like Seeking's long term profitability), so it's unlikely they'll curb the market.\n\nSeeking has their Diamond Membership for exactly this purpose, finding the mega rich. The challenge, I'd imagine, is mega wealthy men probably don't want their information out there for just anyone to find. \n\nSo, we live in a society and government that panders to the mega wealthy, and they continue to consolidate wealth while it continues to shrink for the rest of us.\n\nI think it's unfair to complain about the so-called \"average\" on the site. If a rich guy finds a homely/average looking SB attractive then maybe she has more to offer than just her physicality. Same goes for hot SBs.\n\nI've kinda been through many flavors of SB in my time on the site, from the super hot to the average looking. Ironically, some of the best sex, intimacy and connection I've had was with someone who was more middle of the road.\n\nBut that's the thing with attraction, and where I think some ladies (and guys, too) miss the boat. You can have the biggest ass, boobs, most symmetrical face or whatever the hell media and culture shoves down your throat as being \"hot\" and still fail at SR's. Why? I think it has to do with intention and stoking desire. Hard to do in a quick profile blurb in an oversaturated market, competing in a 5:1 Female to Male ratio. \n\nIf you want to capture a whale, you're gonna have to be as possessed as Captain Ahab. \n\nEither way, this is the community we have now.

She married a Sugar Typcoon that was 24 years older than her. She lovingly referred to him as her Sugar Daddy.\n\nBy the late 1920s any older wealthy man that dated a younger women and spoiled her with gifts was referred to a a sugar daddy.\n\nSugar relationships have always been much closer to vanilla relationships but with spoiling and financial assistance. It\u2019s only been in the last 10 years since Seeking coined the term arrangements did people start having no strings arrangements rather then sugar relationships.\n\nSo please get off your uneducated high horse.\n\nNo one is bashing sex work.

They're not doing this as a job, or a side hustle, or as some form of illegal means of making money.\n\nThe women with the lowest monetary requests turn out to be the best long-term sugar babies & sugar GF's. They want to spend more time with you because they genuinely like you, are attracted you to and want to have sex with you. They don't try to hustle you, or have extra requests, they dont try to upcharge for overnights, most of the time they're the ones that offer to stay the night.\n\nIn addition the women that had the least monetary requests are often the ones that get the most out of me. Because they are unassuming, undemanding, and give of their time so freely, it makes you want to spoil them more.",

I believe the women that treat sugar relationships like a job are the ones constantly searching for new SD, having to juggle multiple SD, because many of these guys that offer higher PPM are only seeing them once or twice a month, etc.\n\nWhereas a women that accepts a modest / average ppm or allowance tend to be the most gratuitous, and when they find a SD that actually wants a sugar relationship not a NSA arrangement they often end up getting more then the girl that wanted more ppm for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all for the consistency. the girl who accepts the modest allowance at half of what the girl that wants a high allowance  has a consistent SD for an entire year without getting any extras from her SD she will  have made more then the girl who is getting double with an inconsistent SD. Add in to the fact that more then likely the girl that wants the higher ppm will take at least twice as long to find a SD like that, then add to that more then likely she will be having shorter term arrangements that last 1-3 months so now there\u2019s more downtime between SD, now she has to pick up a 2nd SD that can only see her once a month when he\u2019s in town, the next thing you know she\u2019s juggling 2-3 SD, none of which are going to be longterm or consistent.\n\nThese types of women are constantly on Seeking. They\u2019re always looking for new SD. \n\nWhereas as the women looking for traditional SR with a more modest allowance end up in longterm 6 month - 2 year relationships. These women also get lots of extras on top of that modest allowance. Most of the time men like this buy them things they need that they can\u2019t afford, help them with unexpected bills, buy them clothes, and take them shopping.\n\nBasically because they have longterm in mind and offer so much they often get more. Whereas women that expect a lot often only get what was agreed too.\n\nOne last thing, to address your comment about why wouldn\u2019t they date just a rich boyfriend.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a few reasons.\n\n1. The average woman in college doesn\u2019t have access to a wealthy guy like that that they can Vanilla date, & even if they did, he\u2019s probably not going to be helping her financially like a SD would.\n\n2. She may not want a vanilla boyfriend while she\u2019s trying hard to focus on school & get her degree\n\n3. Many women on seeking actually are attracted to older men and actually want to date them\n\n4. Many women want to step outside the box that they normally live in and go on an adventure and do something they\u2019ve never tried before which is have a sugar relationship and date an older man just for the experience.\n\nI think what you\u2019re failing to realize, is you\u2019re only looking at sugar dating from your narrow minded view. Not all women are money focused when it comes to sugar relationships. Yes they all want money or some type of financial assistance, but a good majority of them look at the money as a benefit of the relationship, rather than looking at the relationship as something they have to do to get  money \ud83d\ude09",

For all your protesting about clothing, I suspect if you met a hot guy off tinder, you wouldnt care if he showed up in a worn tanktop and shorts. I know that because when I was younger I was that guy in a tanktop and cargo pants, or whatever, and girls didnt give a damn what I wore. :p\n\nAlso, I didnt say I wouldnt make sex enjoyable, just that I doubt its a requirement. What I did say was\n\n>I enjoy sex, and put the effort in, but required? Nope.\n\nMy point being that a guy isnt even required to have sex, plenty of girls want platonic. So to say a guy has to? Eeeeh. There have been plenty of posts here by SBs who are not thrilled with their SDs sexual performance.\n\nThink of it this way. If OP had said, to be a SB you must paint your nails, wear lace underwear, and have an awesome purse, and a perform _ _ _ sex acts, and be hot you'd probably be like. Nope. You dont have to do that. Being hot is enough.\n\nAnd you'd be right. If a girl is fit/hot, I dont care about her nails, underwear, and I wouldnt care if she didnt want anal or something. Would all that be nice?

Their time and energy is finite (and also only catering the the mega wealthy would be a financial drawback for a site like Seeking's long term profitability), so it's unlikely they'll curb the market.\n\nSeeking has their Diamond Membership for exactly this purpose, finding the mega rich. The challenge, I'd imagine, is mega wealthy men probably don't want their information out there for just anyone to find. \n\nSo, we live in a society and government that panders to the mega wealthy, and they continue to consolidate wealth while it continues to shrink for the rest of us.\n\nI think it's unfair to complain about the so-called \"average\" on the site. If a rich guy finds a homely/average looking SB attractive then maybe she has more to offer than just her physicality. Same goes for hot SBs.\n\nI've kinda been through many flavors of SB in my time on the site, from the super hot to the average looking. Ironically, some of the best sex, intimacy and connection I've had was with someone who was more middle of the road.\n\nBut that's the thing with attraction, and where I think some ladies (and guys, too) miss the boat. You can have the biggest ass, boobs, most symmetrical face or whatever the hell media and culture shoves down your throat as being \"hot\" and still fail at SR's. Why? I think it has to do with intention and stoking desire. Hard to do in a quick profile blurb in an oversaturated market, competing in a 5:1 Female to Male ratio. \n\nIf you want to capture a whale, you're gonna have to be as possessed as Captain Ahab. \n\nEither way, this is the community we have now.

She lovingly referred to him as her Sugar Daddy.\n\nBy the late 1920s any older wealthy man that dated a younger women and spoiled her with gifts was referred to a a sugar daddy.\n\nSugar relationships have always been much closer to vanilla relationships but with spoiling and financial assistance. It\u2019s only been in the last 10 years since Seeking coined the term arrangements did people start having no strings arrangements rather then sugar relationships.\n\nSo please get off your uneducated high horse.\n\nNo one is bashing sex work.

I believe the women that treat sugar relationships like a job are the ones constantly searching for new SD, having to juggle multiple SD, because many of these guys that offer higher PPM are only seeing them once or twice a month, etc.\n\nWhereas a women that accepts a modest / average ppm or allowance tend to be the most gratuitous, and when they find a SD that actually wants a sugar relationship not a NSA arrangement they often end up getting more then the girl that wanted more ppm for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all for the consistency. the girl who accepts the modest allowance at half of what the girl that wants a high allowance  has a consistent SD for an entire year without getting any extras from her SD she will  have made more then the girl who is getting double with an inconsistent SD. Add in to the fact that more then likely the girl that wants the higher ppm will take at least twice as long to find a SD like that, then add to that more then likely she will be having shorter term arrangements that last 1-3 months so now there\u2019s more downtime between SD, now she has to pick up a 2nd SD that can only see her once a month when he\u2019s in town, the next thing you know she\u2019s juggling 2-3 SD, none of which are going to be longterm or consistent.\n\nThese types of women are constantly on Seeking. They\u2019re always looking for new SD. \n\nWhereas as the women looking for traditional SR with a more modest allowance end up in longterm 6 month - 2 year relationships. These women also get lots of extras on top of that modest allowance. Most of the time men like this buy them things they need that they can\u2019t afford, help them with unexpected bills, buy them clothes, and take them shopping.\n\nBasically because they have longterm in mind and offer so much they often get more. Whereas women that expect a lot often only get what was agreed too.\n\nOne last thing, to address your comment about why wouldn\u2019t they date just a rich boyfriend.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a few reasons.\n\n1. The average woman in college doesn\u2019t have access to a wealthy guy like that that they can Vanilla date, & even if they did, he\u2019s probably not going to be helping her financially like a SD would.\n\n2. She may not want a vanilla boyfriend while she\u2019s trying hard to focus on school & get her degree\n\n3. Many women on seeking actually are attracted to older men and actually want to date them\n\n4. Many women want to step outside the box that they normally live in and go on an adventure and do something they\u2019ve never tried before which is have a sugar relationship and date an older man just for the experience.\n\nI think what you\u2019re failing to realize, is you\u2019re only looking at sugar dating from your narrow minded view. Not all women are money focused when it comes to sugar relationships. Yes they all want money or some type of financial assistance, but a good majority of them look at the money as a benefit of the relationship, rather than looking at the relationship as something they have to do to get  money \ud83d\ude09",

For all your protesting about clothing, I suspect if you met a hot guy off tinder, you wouldnt care if he showed up in a worn tanktop and shorts. I know that because when I was younger I was that guy in a tanktop and cargo pants, or whatever, and girls didnt give a damn what I wore. :p\n\nAlso, I didnt say I wouldnt make sex enjoyable, just that I doubt its a requirement. What I did say was\n\n>I enjoy sex, and put the effort in, but required? Nope.\n\nMy point being that a guy isnt even required to have sex, plenty of girls want platonic. So to say a guy has to? Eeeeh. There have been plenty of posts here by SBs who are not thrilled with their SDs sexual performance.\n\nThink of it this way. If OP had said, to be a SB you must paint your nails, wear lace underwear, and have an awesome purse, and a perform _ _ _ sex acts, and be hot you'd probably be like. Nope. You dont have to do that. Being hot is enough.\n\nAnd you'd be right. If a girl is fit/hot, I dont care about her nails, underwear, and I wouldnt care if she didnt want anal or something. Would all that be nice? Sure, but its not mandatory.

Their time and energy is finite (and also only catering the the mega wealthy would be a financial drawback for a site like Seeking's long term profitability), so it's unlikely they'll curb the market.\n\nSeeking has their Diamond Membership for exactly this purpose, finding the mega rich. The challenge, I'd imagine, is mega wealthy men probably don't want their information out there for just anyone to find. \n\nSo, we live in a society and government that panders to the mega wealthy, and they continue to consolidate wealth while it continues to shrink for the rest of us.\n\nI think it's unfair to complain about the so-called \"average\" on the site. If a rich guy finds a homely/average looking SB attractive then maybe she has more to offer than just her physicality. Same goes for hot SBs.\n\nI've kinda been through many flavors of SB in my time on the site, from the super hot to the average looking. Ironically, some of the best sex, intimacy and connection I've had was with someone who was more middle of the road.\n\nBut that's the thing with attraction, and where I think some ladies (and guys, too) miss the boat. You can have the biggest ass, boobs, most symmetrical face or whatever the hell media and culture shoves down your throat as being \"hot\" and still fail at SR's. Why? I think it has to do with intention and stoking desire. Hard to do in a quick profile blurb in an oversaturated market, competing in a 5:1 Female to Male ratio. \n\nIf you want to capture a whale, you're gonna have to be as possessed as Captain Ahab. \n\nEither way, this is the community we have now.

She lovingly referred to him as her Sugar Daddy.\n\nBy the late 1920s any older wealthy man that dated a younger women and spoiled her with gifts was referred to a a sugar daddy.\n\nSugar relationships have always been much closer to vanilla relationships but with spoiling and financial assistance. It\u2019s only been in the last 10 years since Seeking coined the term arrangements did people start having no strings arrangements rather then sugar relationships.\n\nSo please get off your uneducated high horse.\n\nNo one is bashing sex work. It\u2019s a necessary service and should be legal. But please don\u2019t tell me that SW invented sugar relationships, because you would be sadly wrong.\n\nMaybe do a little research before you say something so outlandish",

            "body": "If you go into with the mindset of \u2018I need to get paid\u2019 then you\u2019re going to get treated as such. I believe the women that treat sugar relationships like a job are the ones constantly searching for new SD, having to juggle multiple SD, because many of these guys that offer higher PPM are only seeing them once or twice a month, etc.\n\nWhereas a women that accepts a modest / average ppm or allowance tend to be the most gratuitous, and when they find a SD that actually wants a sugar relationship not a NSA arrangement they often end up getting more then the girl that wanted more ppm for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all for the consistency. the girl who accepts the modest allowance at half of what the girl that wants a high allowance  has a consistent SD for an entire year without getting any extras from her SD she will  have made more then the girl who is getting double with an inconsistent SD. Add in to the fact that more then likely the girl that wants the higher ppm will take at least twice as long to find a SD like that, then add to that more then likely she will be having shorter term arrangements that last 1-3 months so now there\u2019s more downtime between SD, now she has to pick up a 2nd SD that can only see her once a month when he\u2019s in town, the next thing you know she\u2019s juggling 2-3 SD, none of which are going to be longterm or consistent.\n\nThese types of women are constantly on Seeking. They\u2019re always looking for new SD. \n\nWhereas as the women looking for traditional SR with a more modest allowance end up in longterm 6 month - 2 year relationships. These women also get lots of extras on top of that modest allowance. Most of the time men like this buy them things they need that they can\u2019t afford, help them with unexpected bills, buy them clothes, and take them shopping.\n\nBasically because they have longterm in mind and offer so much they often get more. Whereas women that expect a lot often only get what was agreed too.\n\nOne last thing, to address your comment about why wouldn\u2019t they date just a rich boyfriend.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a few reasons.\n\n1. The average woman in college doesn\u2019t have access to a wealthy guy like that that they can Vanilla date, & even if they did, he\u2019s probably not going to be helping her financially like a SD would.\n\n2. She may not want a vanilla boyfriend while she\u2019s trying hard to focus on school & get her degree\n\n3. Many women on seeking actually are attracted to older men and actually want to date them\n\n4. Many women want to step outside the box that they normally live in and go on an adventure and do something they\u2019ve never tried before which is have a sugar relationship and date an older man just for the experience.\n\nI think what you\u2019re failing to realize, is you\u2019re only looking at sugar dating from your narrow minded view. Not all women are money focused when it comes to sugar relationships. Yes they all want money or some type of financial assistance, but a good majority of them look at the money as a benefit of the relationship, rather than looking at the relationship as something they have to do to get  money \ud83d\ude09",

Though yes I can understand how that could be read the other way.\n\nWell, I assumed basic hygiene was a given. The whole dress appropriately thing, op did say dress sharp. Not likely to happen with me.\n\nIs that dressing inappropriately? Well if its not something that requires formal attire, then you'd get casual. For all your protesting about clothing, I suspect if you met a hot guy off tinder, you wouldnt care if he showed up in a worn tanktop and shorts. I know that because when I was younger I was that guy in a tanktop and cargo pants, or whatever, and girls didnt give a damn what I wore. :p\n\nAlso, I didnt say I wouldnt make sex enjoyable, just that I doubt its a requirement. What I did say was\n\n>I enjoy sex, and put the effort in, but required? Nope.\n\nMy point being that a guy isnt even required to have sex, plenty of girls want platonic. So to say a guy has to? Eeeeh. There have been plenty of posts here by SBs who are not thrilled with their SDs sexual performance.\n\nThink of it this way. If OP had said, to be a SB you must paint your nails, wear lace underwear, and have an awesome purse, and a perform _ _ _ sex acts, and be hot you'd probably be like. Nope. You dont have to do that. Being hot is enough.\n\nAnd you'd be right. If a girl is fit/hot, I dont care about her nails, underwear, and I wouldnt care if she didnt want anal or something. Would all that be nice? Sure, but its not mandatory. Yup the relationship matters, the emotional connection matters, making sure everyone is happy matters, but in that whole description, being attractive is the only thing thats mandatory.",

Their time and energy is finite (and also only catering the the mega wealthy would be a financial drawback for a site like Seeking's long term profitability), so it's unlikely they'll curb the market.\n\nSeeking has their Diamond Membership for exactly this purpose, finding the mega rich. The challenge, I'd imagine, is mega wealthy men probably don't want their information out there for just anyone to find. \n\nSo, we live in a society and government that panders to the mega wealthy, and they continue to consolidate wealth while it continues to shrink for the rest of us.\n\nI think it's unfair to complain about the so-called \"average\" on the site. If a rich guy finds a homely/average looking SB attractive then maybe she has more to offer than just her physicality. Same goes for hot SBs.\n\nI've kinda been through many flavors of SB in my time on the site, from the super hot to the average looking. Ironically, some of the best sex, intimacy and connection I've had was with someone who was more middle of the road.\n\nBut that's the thing with attraction, and where I think some ladies (and guys, too) miss the boat. You can have the biggest ass, boobs, most symmetrical face or whatever the hell media and culture shoves down your throat as being \"hot\" and still fail at SR's. Why? I think it has to do with intention and stoking desire. Hard to do in a quick profile blurb in an oversaturated market, competing in a 5:1 Female to Male ratio. \n\nIf you want to capture a whale, you're gonna have to be as possessed as Captain Ahab. \n\nEither way, this is the community we have now.

After a couple of initial dates your time together was generally at his house. You watch movies, talk, you know everything thats going on in each others lives.\n\nHe never dresses up, never takes you to fancy places,  he doesnt try to woo you, and honestly the sex for you is kinda lackluster. He does however give you a great allowance and you love spending time together.\n\nIs that a good arrangement or a bad arrangement?",

Also wouldn\u2019t see an SD who didn\u2019t care about making our time in the bedroom a mutually good experience. Money alone certainly doesn\u2019t entitle men to an intimate relationship with me, but I\u2019m happy for you if that\u2019s the case for you and you\u2019re satisfied. Different strokes!",
