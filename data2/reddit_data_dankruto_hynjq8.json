Part one made the Naruto world seem like a mythical world of never-ending warfare, I expected the naruto world to look like post-ww2 Europe or East Asia. They've been through 3 world wars in less than, what, 50 years? \n\nI mean we sort of got that in part two, but I feel like it just never recaptured the same atmosphere as part one. I think it's because Naruto's TnJ made the villains seem like misunderstood teenagers instead of battle-hardened and determined soldiers who have gone through decades of war.",

Part one made the Naruto world seem like a mythical world of never-ending warfare, I expected the naruto world to look like post-ww2 Europe or East Asia. They've been through 3 world wars in less than, what, 50 years? \n\nI mean we sort of got that in part two, but I feel like it just never recaptured the same atmosphere as part one. I think it's because Naruto's TnJ made the villains seem like misunderstood teenagers instead of battle-hardened and determined soldiers who have gone through decades of war.",

Part one made the Naruto world seem like a mythical world of never-ending warfare, I expected the naruto world to look like post-ww2 Europe or East Asia. They've been through 3 world wars in less than, what, 50 years? \n\nI mean we sort of got that in part two, but I feel like it just never recaptured the same atmosphere as part one. I think it's because Naruto's TnJ made the villains seem like misunderstood teenagers instead of battle-hardened and determined soldiers who have gone through decades of war.",
