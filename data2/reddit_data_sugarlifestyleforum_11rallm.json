If you can afford to just let it go, write her off and move on.\n\nCurious, when you say SGF, I assume it was longer term, was this just some long con, or is there room for some possible misunderstanding, etc?

It\u2019s a bit of philosophy that holds that  the simplest answer is typically the most likely answer.  That seems to be the case here as OP stated that she admits that she spent all that money and that most were for expensive spa treatments.\n\nThe alternatives you propose are incredibly unlikely to the point of being preposterous.",

It absolutely wouldn't cross my mind to make false claims in order to get money back *from the stores*.\n\n>That's a poor person's mindset.\n\nAlso mine. And I'd bet much more than 5k that it would be my boyfriend's view, too.\n\n>I wouldn't judge the SD at all for trying to get some of his money back.\n\nNeither do I. It's not the purpose but the method that I disagree with. I judge him for resolving to grifting.",

He gave her a credit card with a higher limit. Which means that he trusted her with that limit. Period. She was authorized to use his credit card.\n\n\nNo judge would even begin to entertain that nonsense. \n\nAnd yes, sugar relationships would likely draw attention in a bad way.

That\u2019s not an honest mistake.\n\n* Sales assistant types in the wrong price\n* She picks up an item which is mislabeled and is actually \\*10 what the label on it reads\n* She enters the pin, but the device is asking what the tip should be, so she greatly increases the price because the pin code is the tip\n* Same item is put in multiple times by mistake\n\nThese have all happened to me at some point & I can think of loads of ways that it happens. When something is soooo out of character it's generally a good idea to look at it rather than run off with the first explanation that comes into your head. All very IMHO of course.

It looks like the first point you made actually supports my assessment that this is a matter to be resolved exclusively between SD and SB -- who, to be clear, are both idiots and dishonest -- and for which no one else should be held liable.\n\nStill, *someone* needs to take the hit and I don't think it should be the merchants (who according to you was only \"following bad business practices\") or taxpayers (see third point raised by you). If anyone actually acted fraudulently, it was SB (by defrauding her SD) and SD (by fraudulently reporting his card lost).",

Without the bit about them \"seeing each other\" for 4 years, this sounds like every prostitute that takes a guys credit card while he was sleeping. \n\nHe tells this story to the police, and they will find the suspicious bits. Guaranteed. Or they talk to her, and she probably would just say it was a disagreement about how much she was allowed to spend. After all, those vacations, years together \"spoiling her\".

It absolutely wouldn't cross my mind to make false claims in order to get money back *from the stores*.\n\n>That's a poor person's mindset.\n\nAlso mine. And I'd bet much more than 5k that it would be my boyfriend's view, too.\n\n>I wouldn't judge the SD at all for trying to get some of his money back.\n\nNeither do I. It's not the purpose but the method that I disagree with. I judge him for resolving to grifting.",

But saying your girlfriend spent too much on the credit card HE gave her is not gonna come off great. Saying he gave her a certain dollar amount to spend, in exchange for having continued sex with him, will probably come off even worse. \n\n\nHe should have called the credit card issuer, asked them to put the limit at $X. Say he was gonna let his kid or girlfriend use it, but wanted to limit their use.",
