I was afraid many casual watchers would be turned off by an episode of talking, especially when RM used to be all about the spectacle. \n\nI also wonder if there have been budget cuts recently. To have an \"anniversary\" episode that featured a photographer, a game on 7 laptops, a homemade game of Taboo, and then some costumes felt a little cheap and a little sad.",

Not just because that\u2019s the way variety trend has been heading towards but as well as their own limitations.\n\nThis recent episode with their anniversary being simple is ok by me.
