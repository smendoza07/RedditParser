    "body": "Before I turn in the towel for this account I wanted to leave with a well meaning message and advice to the SBs on this forum. Probably won\u2019t be replying as I think it\u2019s time to retire this account (if you need advice my PMs are always open). Warning this is a bit of a lengthy one haha \n\n Dear SBs\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have sex the first OR second time you\u2019re meeting an POT SD, maybe even third. It may seem like it is the norm on here but years back when sugaring was still seen as a luxury, it was more acceptable to want to foster a connection before sex. Multiple SBs have expressed that they do just fine this way.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go through multiple sexual encounters with a string of different men before you find the right SD. I abhor this sentiment. Some women like sex and it isn\u2019t a problem and some women like sex but don\u2019t see it as appealing. Vet ruthlessly.\n\nWanting an SD who wants to compensate you for your time in platonic dates does not make you a rinser. They are supposed to have a good amount of disposable income, a few hundreds to a woman they have insane chemistry with isn\u2019t going to do much damage. \n\nYou can find single SDs, do not ever feel pressured to agree to seeing a married man if you are not comfortable with it. Many SBs prefer married men, there is no need for these married men to be lying and not informing SBs that they are. Blackmail from this site is very very very rare and is not an excuse to deceive SBs.\n\nIf you need a substantial amount of money, but an SD is not providing that while pushing for bareback sex and/or exclusivity you have every right to move on. You are not missing out as much as your mind tries to convince you.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t feel hesitant or nervous to tell your SD that you don\u2019t want to have sex sometimes, this is an arrangement where both individuals needs should be balanced. Sometimes you just don\u2019t want to have sex and that is okay, an attempt to lower your allowance or just not provide allowance is a red flag. And before anyone nit picks this is only if you don\u2019t want sex once in a while not a purposeful pattern.\n\nYoutube and other social media sites actually contain very valuable information once you filter through the rinsers and \u201chow to scam SDs \ud83d\ude1b\u201d lol. I have learned an immense amount of useful things from there.\n\nMany advise against asking for allowance specifics before meeting but the amount of men who intend to lowball you no matter what, greatly outnumber the men who will see how charming and beautiful you are and offer you an even higher allowance than if you had discussed it prior over text.\n\nIt is better to start your sugaring experience wanting too much and then slowly realizing that maybe your standards were too high and adjusting it to your area. It is better than the alternative of starting off with lowballed offers and never even exploring if you could get higher.\n\nWhen you first start sugaring desperation easily creeps in, making you want to accept offers or arrangements not up to your standards in fear of losing out on any additional income. That is okay, remember to save up what you can from these arrangements and as you continue your sugaring journey the desperation eases little by little.\n\nLastly the men on here are not and never have been reflective of all SDs on seeking or other sites. Do not take everything they say as good advice, much like some might not see this post as good advice. A lot of stuff on here is being normalized simply because THEY could never imagine themselves doing it so you must be the high maintenance crazy one.\n\nThe search for a sugar relationship might be harder and longer for some but it does not mean that there is anything wrong with you personally. Maybe sugaring might not be for you. Maybe you just have to build up harder skin and more patience. Again it is NEVER reflective of your worth as a person. If sugaring is taking a toll on you, delete or deactivate your account, detach and come back when you feel you are ready.\n\nEDIT: Removed the gifts part because that's all that was being focused on and I'd prefer this post not be derailed.",

            "body": "IMO, and to most SDs/SBs as well,  I think that the most important/controversial? point you made was the one about waiting to have sex. \n\nI\u2019ve stated many times that I never want  intimacy the first date.  I\u2019ve had 6 SRs and I waited anywhere from 2 to 4/5 non intimate dates. \n\nThis is where I see if the chemistry is there.  Kissing, holding hands etc...with a pre discussed solid understanding there will be no sex.  \n\nI do this because my very first SB I met online was visibly nervous on our first date.  I\u2019d booked a room (she knew it) and at dinner it was palatable. \n\nShe was hardly eating her food  and drank two glasses of wine in 5 minutes like it was water found in the desert lol.  \n\nOur deal was we\u2019d have dinner and play it by ear.  I quickly  told her that I decided on no intimacy (told her I decided before the date, didn\u2019t want to make her feel bad).  \n\nI said I\u2019d like to go to the room if she wanted to (Ritz, suite, beautiful view of the city) and hang out. \n\nWorked out fantastic.  She got super comfortable and we ended up hanging out for 3 or 4 hours.  \n\nWe had a couple of drinks, watched a movie, snuggled on the couch and made out a little. I had to go home and I let her enjoy the room. I told her she could get room service in the morning.\n\nShe was my only 20 something SB (25) and I was 48 or 49 at the time. So big age gap.  \n\nAfter that it was a hard rule, no immediate intimacy.  Usually happened on the 3rd or 4th date.  \n\nI think most  SDs on this sub aren\u2019t going to pressure their SBs.  I\u2019ve read many comments on many posts that have emphasized that.",

With limited time to respond and go for meet and greets, even a small gift or gesture (like $30 to cover her uber) can move you to the front of the line. Hell, will all these wallet prudes, it doesn\u2019t take much to stand out these days \ud83e\udd23",

I\u2019ve done it mostly over text but have done it by phone a couple of times too.  \n\nIt\u2019s awesome to get all of that out of the way so that every time I get to see you, starting at the M&G we can spend our time together getting  to know each other.  \n\nI make the discussion very stress free anyway.

I think of it as \u201cThe opportunity to be intimate\u201d.\n\nSex & Money encourages a bad dynamic if you don\u2019t check yourself.  \n\nSo as sure as the sun rises in the east & sets in the West, there will be a fair amount of abuse.  \n\nFrom making a nervous young woman do something she doesn\u2019t want to and making her feel icky & cheap to causing serious emotional issues and full on abusive relationships.  \n\nThis is why I always gift the full PPM every time we see each other. It\u2019s worked out fantastic for me. \n\nYes there were two SBs that I went out on  non intimate dates 2 or 3 times and when we were finally intimate, it was... meh and we decided to part ways. \n\nBased on my PPM number, in those two cases I gifted several thousand and we ended up only having one intimate date.  WORTH IT!\n\nWhy? I\u2019ve netted 3 1/2 outstanding long term SRs with a great variety of some unbelievably beautiful & intelligent women.  Mind blowing sex too. \n\nAgain,just my two cents and I\u2019m not recommending anything, just sharing.",

The current way that \"SDs\" on this forum push as the only way of sugaring has a higher chance of leading to this. They view their select few good experience (despite the bad and lackluster ones they keep quiet about lol) is enough to continue pushing it as the norm because it is the most convenient for a couple of them.\n\nEnsuring your SB is truly comfortable and well acquainted with you especially when it comes to intimacy may lead to a more enjoyable experience as you have shown. Happy you have found what works for you and that you stick to it haha, wishing you the best!\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts :)!",

No one is suggesting you change it.  Just like in real dating - people have different personalities - and attracted to different things.\n\nRegarding sex every day?  To me - this one is really simple.\n\nFor me - sugaring is a replacement for dating.  A typical arrangement is either once a week, or twice a week.  If you are only seeing someone you are dating once a week - isn't it perfectly natural/normal to have sex every time?  And if you are seeing each other twice a week, isn't it also normal that 90% of those times you'll end up having sex?  Unless logistics itself is getting in the way?\n\nIn some cases - this is where libido's and preferences come in.  Not everyone is the same.",

It may lengthen the search for some, but there's nothing like finding a near perfect match to make all the time spent searching  worth it. I do acknowledge people sugaring under more time constrained obligations may not have this privilege, my heart truly goes out to them.\n\nThat is true but I made sure to include the phrasing \"insane chemistry with\" under the assumption that not every SB they will be contacting and/or going on M&G's & dates with will result in an undeniable chemistry. A huge part of why M&G's have become the way they are now is, yes because of rinsers but, SDs using them as some sort of weird speed dating ritual. I have seen some list out the amount of M&G's they have been on or have planned and it's interesting.. but I suspect the numbers may be inflated. If one is going on a lot of M&G's it makes sense why they would frown at the idea of paying every single one of them, simple solution is just to vet better and reduce the number of dates.\n\nOn that note I am going to choose to not unpack the discussion on whether or not that amount should be disposable to men who want to call themselves SDs. ;)\n\nThank you for your input I actually enjoyed reading your perspective!",

I'm sure most of us with SD's can attest to the fact that our SD would never spend so much time on a Reddit forum so their mentalities truly aren't reflective of much of what we see here.*\n\n*There are a few great, thoughtful SD contributors (albeit in the minority).",

I want my sb to be comfortable with me always and I certainly want to give her as many platonic dates as she needs. Within reason of course. You might not go through multiple sexual encounters until you find mr right but you will most certainly be looking in the bowl for awhile before you find the one you like. It takes time. Just like in vanilla you dont get the most amazing bf first time around usually. \n\n\"Wanting an SD who wants to compensate you for your time in platonic dates does not make you a rinser. They are supposed to have a good amount of disposable income, a few hundreds to a woman they have insane chemistry with isn\u2019t going to do much damage.\"\n\nThat very same logic can be applied to the sd side. How much has the sb possibly lost going on a few platonic dates where she is wined and dined? Nothing, she got a free meal and good conversation. Not wanting to pay past that does not make the sd a splenda or salt daddy. I'm here to see if theres attraction and chemistry just as you are. I dont feel an sd has an obligation to pay for the first few \"getting to know dates\" , that being said I would personally compensate some money  for her time and gas, if I genuinely like her and want to take things further.  M&gs are generally unpaid. I gave a gift twice at the m&g and none of those resulted in srs. So I see it as bad luck honestly.\n\nLastly, all of these rules are just guidelines. I've violated every rule in the book and sbs violated many with me and had we had successful srs. The very first sb and longest sb I had we hooked up the 1st meet with no m&g. You really just need to trust your gut and screen accordingly.",

I never expected money because I saw it as an investment in a dating style I wanted.  But I'm pretty sure I lost money the year I was trying (and mostly failing) to sugar date lol.\n\nSo yes, platonic dates shouldn't carry the expectation of compensation but there is an unseen cost that goes into those dates.",

                    "body": "I am going to disagree to some point. Not only do many SBs have actual fixed costs for dates, but there is an opportunity cost as well.\n\nFixed costs get talked about a lot but to just list a few: Hair, makeup, attire, personal grooming, transportation, childcare, and likely missed work hours (unlike many SDs, SBs usually get paid by the hour at their jobs). It can cost me anywhere from $100-200 just for a meet and greet over lunch... which is more than most SDs spend on the lunch.\n\nThe opportunity cost varies by the quality of the SB. A high quality SB has dozens of messages per day from quality men in her vanilla and sugar dating sites. If she wanted a free dinner she could go on a vanilla date with a young, wealthy, bachelor who has more to offer than money for sex. Heck, she could pay for it herself a lot of the time and save money and time getting dressed up. We\u2019re not desperate for dates, discretion, or NSA relationships.\n\nIf she\u2019s also working a full-time job she has limited opportunities to go on dates. With the ridiculous amount of salt daddies these days, a small gesture offering to cover gas and childcare can go a long ways to show you\u2019re serious. SDs like to take a lot of our time and attention away from other POTs or vanilla relationships but often only see our value once physical intimacy has started, which makes us feel like prostitutes. Why is our attention and affection not of value to those who are benefiting from it? Even asking for a selfie or \u2018quick video call\u2019 can mean 30-45 min for us to get dressed up. This is why I don\u2019t do coffee dates, nothing for me is merely \u201815 min\u2019 and you can\u2019t possibly gauge chemistry with someone in such a short period of time.\n\nIf an SD was content with me coming in my work clothes and hair in a ponytail until he was willing to help out, then I\u2019d be more understanding of him not wanting to provide until he thinks he\u2019s benefiting, but if the focus is really in the relationship, a small investment and show of sincerity will go a long ways for the daddies favor to show he appreciates our effort to look good and be available for him.",

I date sbs close to me, if they are far, I drive to them. I like the low maintenance girl next door types, 5 min shower, t shirt jeans, a lil lipstick, good enough for me. Work clothes? Good enough for me , takes the pressure off me knowing you have stable income and aren't relying on me to get paid ( happened to me before) . I also love women who have their hair up. It's a serious turn on for me.  In, and out of the bedroom.   Havent dated an sb with a child yet, so I cant comment on that. I sugar to have less headaches not more. But if I did, I'd hope she had family that could watch the baby. I usually got for sbs 19 to 25 who dont have kids, have free time and not loads of debt.  a quality sb has plenty of messages from vanilla men and sds. True, I've never had an SR with a 9 / 10 quality sb. I refused their offers right off the bat as they were out of my price range, no time wasted. My time is valuable too and my inbox has 10 messages awaiting replies of sbs ready to take my money. An SR is one of the only times a man has as just as much interest from the other party to get something going. My time is also valuable. Again, all of that being said I'm still open to the idea of paying for platonic dates. And I think If i get back into the bowl I'm going to stress platonic and no expectations early on pretty hard, while compensating.",

No. You don\u2019t get brownie points just for showing up. There\u2019s way more women willing to do much more for much less, and that\u2019s not something you should take advantage of, but you\u2019re seriously advocating to show us \u201chow serious\u201d we are?

I\u2019ve seen him about 20 times and things are still happily platonic (yes, he knows it\u2019s not leading to intimacy or romance). K don\u2019t consider him a unicorn because I have had several similar arrangements, you just have to know how to add value to their life beyond sex.

Simply that, the allowance would start once we agree to fully move forward.  A fair amount start after an extended M&G that turns into a date.  The rest (that start) do after the next date.  I've never pushed it, it just happens.\n\nAnd by that same token - the whole platonic date conversation in general is just foreign to me.  It's something that gets talked about on here - not something I run into.\n\nI mean - have there been times where, we ate too much, and didn't feel like sex?  Or she got too drunk and passed out after I ate her out?  But I would never have called those dates platonic.  We still made out.  We still slept (in bed) together.

I\u2019ve had great success! \n\nThank you for having the courage to share this post, knowing there would be backlash. Much of what you have said needs to be heard by newbie SBs particularly. Like you rightly said, the SDs on here do not fairly reflect the SDs on Seeking and thus their opinions are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Honestly, not one of my great past SDs would spend time on this forum! This is a great forum, but generally speaking, men of a certain age and lifestyle are much less likely to be on here.",

Glad to hear that you were able to do what worked for you and stuck to it. I wanted to add something about allowance vs ppm like you mentioned but knew that point would definitely strike a nerve on this forum. I am already being accused of encouraging platonic rinsing I can't imagine the uproar if I had added allowance before intimacy happens sometimes (with hard work, lots of time together and a genuine connection) or at least switching to allowance within the first 1-2 months of an arrangement.\n\n> Honestly, not one of my great past SDs would spend time on this forum! This is a great forum, but generally speaking, men of a certain age and lifestyle are much less likely to be on here. \n\nThis seems to be a reoccurring view among many SBs on this post haha, no doubt that there may be great SD contributors on here.

Point blank - you have every right to move on period.  No matter what the reason.  Do you feel like the chemistry is gone?  Polity end the SR.  Pushing your boundaries?  End it.  Adding substantial money to it just increases the golden handcuff effect.  \n\n> Lastly the men on here are not and never have been reflective of all SDs on seeking or other sites. \n\nI know, most of the guys on the sites are far worse, right?   \n\nOf course - that's not what you meant.

Lately half the topics go toxic, so I can see why you might have that point of view.  \n\nThere will always be different lifestyle ranges in sugaring.

But I don't offer more than I can afford, and I hope they never settle for less than they want. I don't have space for resentment.\n\nWhich makes this like vanilla relationships really, in that communication and authenticity are paramount. If everyone is open with their capabilities and comfort levels I think there would be a lot more happiness in these relationships. Sugar daddies also shouldn't feel bad for not being able to afford what a super rich daddy might be able to afford; but don't present yourself as someone who has more means than you actually do. It's not fair to waste people's time. Especially when they're clear about what they want.\n\nHaha, sorry for soapboxing. I just found this quite moving.",

Women have their hand out and want to be paid for their time. A sugar relationship is not being about being paid for your time. You\u2019re not being compensated. You\u2019re supposed to be being spoiled. A man spoils a woman that he has interest in, and shows appreciation and affection for him. Not just a woman that meets him for dinner and spends time with him.\n\nSo if you want to give a word of advice to new sugar babies, tell them  not to have their hands out in the beginning and to look for a man who has traditional values and wants to spoil them and shows by his actions that he\u2019s genuinely interested in them. Not someone that\u2019s looking to purchase their time because that\u2019s not a sugar daddy, that someone is trying to either have sex with you or someone that is trying to control you by using money as a form of appellation.",

I think of it as \u201cThe opportunity to be intimate\u201d.\n\nSex & Money encourages a bad dynamic if you don\u2019t check yourself.  \n\nSo as sure as the sun rises in the east & sets in the West, there will be a fair amount of abuse.  \n\nFrom making a nervous young woman do something she doesn\u2019t want to and making her feel icky & cheap to causing serious emotional issues and full on abusive relationships.  \n\nThis is why I always gift the full PPM every time we see each other. It\u2019s worked out fantastic for me. \n\nYes there were two SBs that I went out on  non intimate dates 2 or 3 times and when we were finally intimate, it was... meh and we decided to part ways. \n\nBased on my PPM number, in those two cases I gifted several thousand and we ended up only having one intimate date.  WORTH IT!\n\nWhy? I\u2019ve netted 3 1/2 outstanding long term SRs with a great variety of some unbelievably beautiful & intelligent women.  Mind blowing sex too. \n\nAgain,just my two cents and I\u2019m not recommending anything, just sharing.",

The current way that \"SDs\" on this forum push as the only way of sugaring has a higher chance of leading to this. They view their select few good experience (despite the bad and lackluster ones they keep quiet about lol) is enough to continue pushing it as the norm because it is the most convenient for a couple of them.\n\nEnsuring your SB is truly comfortable and well acquainted with you especially when it comes to intimacy may lead to a more enjoyable experience as you have shown. Happy you have found what works for you and that you stick to it haha, wishing you the best!\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts :)!",

I still view number scales as not informative, other characteristics other than physical appearance make up a person's allure and charm. Most of what sustains a SR is personality and compatibility in my experience, being pretty definitely helps haha\n\nEvery single point made on this post may not be applicable to all SB's, but to say that only very attractive women would benefit from it is damaging. I really can't see why you would think that, this post is centered on a SBs comfort and finding SR that is right for her without having to compromise her values or standards. It may lengthen the search for some, but there's nothing like finding a near perfect match to make all the time spent searching  worth it. I do acknowledge people sugaring under more time constrained obligations may not have this privilege, my heart truly goes out to them.\n\nThat is true but I made sure to include the phrasing \"insane chemistry with\" under the assumption that not every SB they will be contacting and/or going on M&G's & dates with will result in an undeniable chemistry. A huge part of why M&G's have become the way they are now is, yes because of rinsers but, SDs using them as some sort of weird speed dating ritual. I have seen some list out the amount of M&G's they have been on or have planned and it's interesting.. but I suspect the numbers may be inflated. If one is going on a lot of M&G's it makes sense why they would frown at the idea of paying every single one of them, simple solution is just to vet better and reduce the number of dates.\n\nOn that note I am going to choose to not unpack the discussion on whether or not that amount should be disposable to men who want to call themselves SDs. ;)\n\nThank you for your input I actually enjoyed reading your perspective!",

Probably not but if an SB isn't comfortable with the other ways people sugar they should't feel pressured to sugar that way.\n\nThe advice won't be applicable to everyone and every situation and that is okay.

            "body": "I am going to disagree to some point. Not only do many SBs have actual fixed costs for dates, but there is an opportunity cost as well.\n\nFixed costs get talked about a lot but to just list a few: Hair, makeup, attire, personal grooming, transportation, childcare, and likely missed work hours (unlike many SDs, SBs usually get paid by the hour at their jobs). It can cost me anywhere from $100-200 just for a meet and greet over lunch... which is more than most SDs spend on the lunch.\n\nThe opportunity cost varies by the quality of the SB. A high quality SB has dozens of messages per day from quality men in her vanilla and sugar dating sites. If she wanted a free dinner she could go on a vanilla date with a young, wealthy, bachelor who has more to offer than money for sex. Heck, she could pay for it herself a lot of the time and save money and time getting dressed up. We\u2019re not desperate for dates, discretion, or NSA relationships.\n\nIf she\u2019s also working a full-time job she has limited opportunities to go on dates. With the ridiculous amount of salt daddies these days, a small gesture offering to cover gas and childcare can go a long ways to show you\u2019re serious. SDs like to take a lot of our time and attention away from other POTs or vanilla relationships but often only see our value once physical intimacy has started, which makes us feel like prostitutes. Why is our attention and affection not of value to those who are benefiting from it? Even asking for a selfie or \u2018quick video call\u2019 can mean 30-45 min for us to get dressed up. This is why I don\u2019t do coffee dates, nothing for me is merely \u201815 min\u2019 and you can\u2019t possibly gauge chemistry with someone in such a short period of time.\n\nIf an SD was content with me coming in my work clothes and hair in a ponytail until he was willing to help out, then I\u2019d be more understanding of him not wanting to provide until he thinks he\u2019s benefiting, but if the focus is really in the relationship, a small investment and show of sincerity will go a long ways for the daddies favor to show he appreciates our effort to look good and be available for him.",

I date sbs close to me, if they are far, I drive to them. I like the low maintenance girl next door types, 5 min shower, t shirt jeans, a lil lipstick, good enough for me. Work clothes? Good enough for me , takes the pressure off me knowing you have stable income and aren't relying on me to get paid ( happened to me before) . I also love women who have their hair up. It's a serious turn on for me.  In, and out of the bedroom.   Havent dated an sb with a child yet, so I cant comment on that. I sugar to have less headaches not more. But if I did, I'd hope she had family that could watch the baby. I usually got for sbs 19 to 25 who dont have kids, have free time and not loads of debt.  a quality sb has plenty of messages from vanilla men and sds. True, I've never had an SR with a 9 / 10 quality sb. I refused their offers right off the bat as they were out of my price range, no time wasted. My time is valuable too and my inbox has 10 messages awaiting replies of sbs ready to take my money. An SR is one of the only times a man has as just as much interest from the other party to get something going. My time is also valuable. Again, all of that being said I'm still open to the idea of paying for platonic dates. And I think If i get back into the bowl I'm going to stress platonic and no expectations early on pretty hard, while compensating.",

Nothing you said was wrong and I think guys tend to over simplify the effort women go through to get ready for dates, including me, and I will remember this in the future. I think some men like to give gifts if they feel the date is going good and like it to be a surprise, vs asking for something before even meeting will turn a lot of guys off, including me. The sb has a perfectly valid point though and doesnt want her time wasted. It's funny how things can look good on paper but dont always work out that way.",

I'm not saying it doesn't exist - but that's a unicorn I haven't seen.  And... sure, if we've actually invested time getting to know each other..... then I might take the risk on it.

My most recent SD and I talked for about a week and exchanged roughly 1500 words in emails prior to our first meeting. I never had to ask for anything and he\u2019s never shown up empty handed. I\u2019ve seen him about 20 times and things are still happily platonic (yes, he knows it\u2019s not leading to intimacy or romance). K don\u2019t consider him a unicorn because I have had several similar arrangements, you just have to know how to add value to their life beyond sex. That\u2019s why I disagree with the constant objection to the SDs who dispute platonic. I would never consider a intimate arrangement where he wasn\u2019t generous prior to intimacy.",

Glad to hear that you were able to do what worked for you and stuck to it. I wanted to add something about allowance vs ppm like you mentioned but knew that point would definitely strike a nerve on this forum. I am already being accused of encouraging platonic rinsing I can't imagine the uproar if I had added allowance before intimacy happens sometimes (with hard work, lots of time together and a genuine connection) or at least switching to allowance within the first 1-2 months of an arrangement.\n\n> Honestly, not one of my great past SDs would spend time on this forum! This is a great forum, but generally speaking, men of a certain age and lifestyle are much less likely to be on here. \n\nThis seems to be a reoccurring view among many SBs on this post haha, no doubt that there may be great SD contributors on here.

The current way that \"SDs\" on this forum push as the only way of sugaring has a higher chance of leading to this. They view their select few good experience (despite the bad and lackluster ones they keep quiet about lol) is enough to continue pushing it as the norm because it is the most convenient for a couple of them.\n\nEnsuring your SB is truly comfortable and well acquainted with you especially when it comes to intimacy may lead to a more enjoyable experience as you have shown. Happy you have found what works for you and that you stick to it haha, wishing you the best!\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts :)!",

I still view number scales as not informative, other characteristics other than physical appearance make up a person's allure and charm. Most of what sustains a SR is personality and compatibility in my experience, being pretty definitely helps haha\n\nEvery single point made on this post may not be applicable to all SB's, but to say that only very attractive women would benefit from it is damaging. I really can't see why you would think that, this post is centered on a SBs comfort and finding SR that is right for her without having to compromise her values or standards. It may lengthen the search for some, but there's nothing like finding a near perfect match to make all the time spent searching  worth it. I do acknowledge people sugaring under more time constrained obligations may not have this privilege, my heart truly goes out to them.\n\nThat is true but I made sure to include the phrasing \"insane chemistry with\" under the assumption that not every SB they will be contacting and/or going on M&G's & dates with will result in an undeniable chemistry. A huge part of why M&G's have become the way they are now is, yes because of rinsers but, SDs using them as some sort of weird speed dating ritual. I have seen some list out the amount of M&G's they have been on or have planned and it's interesting.. but I suspect the numbers may be inflated. If one is going on a lot of M&G's it makes sense why they would frown at the idea of paying every single one of them, simple solution is just to vet better and reduce the number of dates.\n\nOn that note I am going to choose to not unpack the discussion on whether or not that amount should be disposable to men who want to call themselves SDs. ;)\n\nThank you for your input I actually enjoyed reading your perspective!",

It is not a perfect world yes but I am sure there are SBs that sugar like I mentioned above and are doing just fine. Is it the more common route? Probably not but if an SB isn't comfortable with the other ways people sugar they should't feel pressured to sugar that way.\n\nThe advice won't be applicable to everyone and every situation and that is okay. I am not claiming it is. It is also directed at the views on here that are being pushed as the universal standards and expectations.

I date sbs close to me, if they are far, I drive to them. I like the low maintenance girl next door types, 5 min shower, t shirt jeans, a lil lipstick, good enough for me. Work clothes? Good enough for me , takes the pressure off me knowing you have stable income and aren't relying on me to get paid ( happened to me before) . I also love women who have their hair up. It's a serious turn on for me.  In, and out of the bedroom.   Havent dated an sb with a child yet, so I cant comment on that. I sugar to have less headaches not more. But if I did, I'd hope she had family that could watch the baby. I usually got for sbs 19 to 25 who dont have kids, have free time and not loads of debt.  a quality sb has plenty of messages from vanilla men and sds. True, I've never had an SR with a 9 / 10 quality sb. I refused their offers right off the bat as they were out of my price range, no time wasted. My time is valuable too and my inbox has 10 messages awaiting replies of sbs ready to take my money. An SR is one of the only times a man has as just as much interest from the other party to get something going. My time is also valuable. Again, all of that being said I'm still open to the idea of paying for platonic dates. And I think If i get back into the bowl I'm going to stress platonic and no expectations early on pretty hard, while compensating.",

The current way that \"SDs\" on this forum push as the only way of sugaring has a higher chance of leading to this. They view their select few good experience (despite the bad and lackluster ones they keep quiet about lol) is enough to continue pushing it as the norm because it is the most convenient for a couple of them.\n\nEnsuring your SB is truly comfortable and well acquainted with you especially when it comes to intimacy may lead to a more enjoyable experience as you have shown. Happy you have found what works for you and that you stick to it haha, wishing you the best!\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts :)!",

I still view number scales as not informative, other characteristics other than physical appearance make up a person's allure and charm. Most of what sustains a SR is personality and compatibility in my experience, being pretty definitely helps haha\n\nEvery single point made on this post may not be applicable to all SB's, but to say that only very attractive women would benefit from it is damaging. I really can't see why you would think that, this post is centered on a SBs comfort and finding SR that is right for her without having to compromise her values or standards. It may lengthen the search for some, but there's nothing like finding a near perfect match to make all the time spent searching  worth it. I do acknowledge people sugaring under more time constrained obligations may not have this privilege, my heart truly goes out to them.\n\nThat is true but I made sure to include the phrasing \"insane chemistry with\" under the assumption that not every SB they will be contacting and/or going on M&G's & dates with will result in an undeniable chemistry. A huge part of why M&G's have become the way they are now is, yes because of rinsers but, SDs using them as some sort of weird speed dating ritual. I have seen some list out the amount of M&G's they have been on or have planned and it's interesting.. but I suspect the numbers may be inflated. If one is going on a lot of M&G's it makes sense why they would frown at the idea of paying every single one of them, simple solution is just to vet better and reduce the number of dates.\n\nOn that note I am going to choose to not unpack the discussion on whether or not that amount should be disposable to men who want to call themselves SDs. ;)\n\nThank you for your input I actually enjoyed reading your perspective!",

My most recent SD and I talked for about a week and exchanged roughly 1500 words in emails prior to our first meeting. I never had to ask for anything and he\u2019s never shown up empty handed. I\u2019ve seen him about 20 times and things are still happily platonic (yes, he knows it\u2019s not leading to intimacy or romance). K don\u2019t consider him a unicorn because I have had several similar arrangements, you just have to know how to add value to their life beyond sex.

I still view number scales as not informative, other characteristics other than physical appearance make up a person's allure and charm. Most of what sustains a SR is personality and compatibility in my experience, being pretty definitely helps haha\n\nEvery single point made on this post may not be applicable to all SB's, but to say that only very attractive women would benefit from it is damaging. I really can't see why you would think that, this post is centered on a SBs comfort and finding SR that is right for her without having to compromise her values or standards. It may lengthen the search for some, but there's nothing like finding a near perfect match to make all the time spent searching  worth it. I do acknowledge people sugaring under more time constrained obligations may not have this privilege, my heart truly goes out to them.\n\nThat is true but I made sure to include the phrasing \"insane chemistry with\" under the assumption that not every SB they will be contacting and/or going on M&G's & dates with will result in an undeniable chemistry. A huge part of why M&G's have become the way they are now is, yes because of rinsers but, SDs using them as some sort of weird speed dating ritual. I have seen some list out the amount of M&G's they have been on or have planned and it's interesting.. but I suspect the numbers may be inflated. If one is going on a lot of M&G's it makes sense why they would frown at the idea of paying every single one of them, simple solution is just to vet better and reduce the number of dates.\n\nOn that note I am going to choose to not unpack the discussion on whether or not that amount should be disposable to men who want to call themselves SDs. ;)\n\nThank you for your input I actually enjoyed reading your perspective!",

I'm not saying it doesn't exist - but that's a unicorn I haven't seen.  And... sure, if we've actually invested time getting to know each other..... then I might take the risk on it.

My most recent SD and I talked for about a week and exchanged roughly 1500 words in emails prior to our first meeting. I never had to ask for anything and he\u2019s never shown up empty handed. I\u2019ve seen him about 20 times and things are still happily platonic (yes, he knows it\u2019s not leading to intimacy or romance). K don\u2019t consider him a unicorn because I have had several similar arrangements, you just have to know how to add value to their life beyond sex. That\u2019s why I disagree with the constant objection to the SDs who dispute platonic. I would never consider a intimate arrangement where he wasn\u2019t generous prior to intimacy.",

I still view number scales as not informative, other characteristics other than physical appearance make up a person's allure and charm. Most of what sustains a SR is personality and compatibility in my experience, being pretty definitely helps haha\n\nEvery single point made on this post may not be applicable to all SB's, but to say that only very attractive women would benefit from it is damaging. I really can't see why you would think that, this post is centered on a SBs comfort and finding SR that is right for her without having to compromise her values or standards. It may lengthen the search for some, but there's nothing like finding a near perfect match to make all the time spent searching  worth it. I do acknowledge people sugaring under more time constrained obligations may not have this privilege, my heart truly goes out to them.\n\nThat is true but I made sure to include the phrasing \"insane chemistry with\" under the assumption that not every SB they will be contacting and/or going on M&G's & dates with will result in an undeniable chemistry. A huge part of why M&G's have become the way they are now is, yes because of rinsers but, SDs using them as some sort of weird speed dating ritual. I have seen some list out the amount of M&G's they have been on or have planned and it's interesting.. but I suspect the numbers may be inflated. If one is going on a lot of M&G's it makes sense why they would frown at the idea of paying every single one of them, simple solution is just to vet better and reduce the number of dates.\n\nOn that note I am going to choose to not unpack the discussion on whether or not that amount should be disposable to men who want to call themselves SDs. ;)\n\nThank you for your input I actually enjoyed reading your perspective!",

You make a good point that anyone asking for payment or offering payment within the first 3-4 brief messages is likely a scammer, I avoid these men like the plague and have had good experiences as such. As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, women and men who aren\u2019t sincere give the rest of us genuinely looking for a SR a bad rap.\n\nTips for SBs following this: I talked to my POTs for a fair bit before we meet, as it helps to weed out the time wasters and scammers and establish a real connection. My most recent SD and I talked for about a week and exchanged roughly 1500 words in emails prior to our first meeting. I never had to ask for anything and he\u2019s never shown up empty handed. I\u2019ve seen him about 20 times and things are still happily platonic (yes, he knows it\u2019s not leading to intimacy or romance). K don\u2019t consider him a unicorn because I have had several similar arrangements, you just have to know how to add value to their life beyond sex. That\u2019s why I disagree with the constant objection to the SDs who dispute platonic. I would never consider a intimate arrangement where he wasn\u2019t generous prior to intimacy.",

One side has just been evidently trying to normalize their way as the only \"sensible\" way or the \"consensus\". Certain SDs that rushed to tell me that my post is unrealistic, worthless and \"Cinderella fairy tale\",  despite it coming from experience and other SBs, was all the confirmation I needed.\n\nIt is damaging to new and returning SB's who now feel that it is the only way they must pursue sugaring, despite how unfulfilling and uncomfortable it makes them feel.",
