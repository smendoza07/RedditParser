    "body": "No legitimate arrangement I've had has begun with paying someone before meeting. 20+ paying someone before meeting has led to me never actually meeting the person.\n\nYet, someone(s) are training a generation of women to come up with nonsense like: \"From my perspective, if you're on this site looking for a mutually beneficial relationship...\" which is basically nonsense.   \n\n\nYou have to invest time -- an hour, perhaps less -- in getting to know someone before there is an arrangement to be mutually beneficial. Your goal of shortcutting this by seeking compensation so \"at least I got something\" is the worst kind of transactional. \n\nPlease stop. Tell your friends to stop. We'll work on the guys who waste your time and have no positive intentions either.\n\nBut I'll tell you the last 5 conversations have involved a woman who happily spends 20-30 minutes texting or SA mesaging, only to demand compensation for the first videochat (!).   \n\n\nTheir own actions belie the claim it's about time saving. And it's destroying SA.   \n\n\nThanks for listening to my TEDTalk.",

I don't know why these men are playing these games, but an upfront small gift would probably weed out those who aren't serious.",

I just spent a few days getting to know a man via text whom I planned on meeting with this week. Each time I brought up PPM/allowance, he avoided the conversation. Finally, he asked me what I would need to get in order to make ends meet. I told him what I expected (which was reasonable and normal for my area), and he told me that it was a turn off that I claimed to be independent while also sugaring. He said that he wouldn\u2019t be persuaded to \u201cpay a specific amount\u201d based on it being \u201cnormal.\u201d I said I wasn\u2019t trying to persuade him and if we didn\u2019t agree, we weren\u2019t a match, and it would be okay! He also told me that almost every arrangement he\u2019s been in involved no monetary exchange whatsoever; when I told him that I can appreciate his past experiences but traditional sugaring involves financial support and intimacy in the relationship, he told me that he appreciated that was my \u201cperception\u201d. I told him that I broke my own rule by not getting the allowance conversation out-of-the-way from the start, and he told me that I brought it up several times and absolutely didn\u2019t break my rule, and the amount of times I brought it up was also a turn off. I\u2019m sorry, but what am I supposed to do if you don\u2019t answer me? I told him that we were not compatible, which was fine, and wished him well. He told me that he doubted I would find what I needed. I blocked him.\n\nI\u2019ve had half a dozen supposed sugar daddies on the website offer me experience-based relationships in the past week or so, as well as offer me absolutely nothing other than \u201cmentoring\u201d and what would amount to vanilla dating, like the POT described above.

They would have either left me alone, or at least I would have been left standing with something from my wish list. Like, shit, what\u2019s a girl gotta do to get some fancy oven mitts or a coffee table book these days? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, I know all the clich\u00e9s about this being a game of numbers to a point, and how you have to take the risk of investing time and money, and how lots of girls are scamming men, etc \n\nOn the flip side: as a SB we experience many men who want to do the following before the arrangement begins or an in person M&G happens\n* text endlessly\n* push boundaries by asking naughty questions\n* push boundaries by asking for naughty pics of you\n* ask to talk on the phone and *then* ask naughty questions\n* demand video M&G with you wearing something particular. \u201cPls wear a short skirt and knee socks\u201d\nEtc etc \n\nAnd 9/10 of them will never meet.  \nLike I said, I went through this 3x in the last 4 days. \n\n\nThere are time wasting men out there who think to themselves: \u201cI\u2019m going to game these innocent women who are just trying in good faith to find a SD. Im going to extract free online companionship and content from them!!\u201d\n\nThese type of scam artists are now masquerading as the \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be COVID safe Daddy\u201d.",

One is just a few bucks, the other is my [privacy and discretion](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/lylgbx/sb_109_thoughts_from_an_sb_who_never_share_my/). \n\nIf I am sharing with someone what I look like - I need to see what they look like too at the same time - and *I do not trust pictures* \\- plenty of pictures have been stolen off of social media and locked/private pictures from friend's accounts by people, and I've been recipients of stolen pictures too many times. So the only way to ensure that I know who I'm talking to - and they have the same knowledge - is to meet in person, or to have a live video chat. I am not sharing my face otherwise to random people who ask, for the off chance that I may or may not end up meeting them. That is not total discretion.\n\n>I'm quite sure you and I will never meet. \n\nI'll be forever sad about that! /s",

People are free to text or not text and I'm respectful of their time. I find that they initiate conversations more than I do. They can stay or move on. \n\n\nIt seems like people are going to waste the time one way or another. Either wasting time texting that goes no where or wasting time with meet and greets that go nowhere. I sugar in another town, so I don't have time for wasted meet and greets.\n\n\n I'm not jerking anyone around. I'm clear and specific about what I offer early on (allowance, times etc). I just don't see the point of meeting unless the potential is there. I see it as efficiently. Don't we have posts on here all the time about wasting time on pointless meet and greets? Or people start talking Monday, have a meet and greet Wednesday, and then get pump and dumped or scammed on Friday?\n\n\nI'm not claiming my way is the only way, just the way that has worked for me for nearly two decades of great long SRs. I'm sure I lose pots along the way. That's ok. Enough of them find my upfront and clear style refreshing that I find what I'm looking for. I get a lot of interest I suspect because I'm very polite. I don't ask for nudes, talk dirty, sext, etc. Maybe that makes me seem more legit? In the last decade I have had exactly 1 meet and greet that didn't end up in a SR. I also never pump and dump and I only have SB and treat her very, very well. Oldschoolsd right?\n\n\nI also suspect I get a lot interest and patience because I show genuine interest in them.\n\nWhen Chuchill's mother had dinner with Gladstone and Disraeli, she said, \"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.\"\n\n\nI will admit I haven't tried video chatting much so I might try that down the road. Its newer to me because I tend to have long SRs. \n\n\nI know there is a lot frustration in the bowl and it is getting worse. Maybe the current popular practice isn't working. I don't have a good answer to it for other people. I just have an answer for myself.",

I'll promise a smaller cash allowance just for the meet sometimes and those have been maybe 50/50 at best.\n\nfor SBs not wasting time on a meet and greet, just try to schedule quick coffee/dessert dates or walking around a public area.  don't agree to an entire dinner date the first time. make the SD come to a public place NEAR YOU for a quick meet. could leave in 5minutes or if it goes well, u can always migrate to dinner or whatever. I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",

I think it's her way of trying to guarantee the experience is legit and won't be a waste of time.  And I totally know the SDs are tired of it too but this is from a SB perspective. \n\nI've even had guys try to scam by saying they will send $500+ before basic introductions are exchanged.  Obviously, that is fake too.  I told him that I would rather meet in person first and he got all pissy and blocked.  There are so many scammers and time wasters on both ends, it's so frustrating. \n\nI think there's no real winning formula unless you connect with the right person at the right time.   \n\nFor me, I'm always wary but am perfectly content meeting up for a cup of coffee, light lunch or if sparks are really flying, a nice dinner with a bottle of wine.  Only fear is that it's a secret salt daddy who is going to stiff me with the bill.  Not that I can't pay and it hasn't happened yet but....I admit it's still a concern.   I think my experience as an escort has helped weed out those guys though. \n\nHowever, my favorite experiences have always been with confident SDs that invite me to a nice dinner with no expectations except to enjoy the food, wine and conversation.  If he wants to give a small gift, I'm all about it but it's never expected on a first date.  I'd rather build a connection that can leave us both anxious for more opposed to making him feel like he's an ATM...or him making me feel like I'm only a walking vagina to be used.",

He seems to be none the worse for wear for those bad experiences. He\u2019s still in the bowl. He\u2019s out some cash. There\u2019s no emotional or psychological damage. (Well, there might be some pre-existing damage if he did this 20+ times, but that\u2019s another story.;))\n\nCan you imagine any woman being willing to persist with this after 20+ times sleeping with a man and not getting the agreed upon PPM?\n\nI would never agree to pay to meet someone. But TBH, none of the POTs I went beyond a few cursory messages with ever asked. I always brought a gift to the M&G. Not cash, and never anything risqu\u00e9 or sexual (no lingerie, sex toys or whatever. You laugh- I\u2019ve had SB friends tell me some of the stuff they\u2019ve received at M&Gs.) But something small, classy, and appropriate. I\u2019m not gonna say what my go-to M&G gift was because you guys will steal it. ;)\n\nThis just seems like the reality of SA these days: so much shit to sort through to find someone genuine.\n\nOh, and OP, if you do need a conservator, I\u2019m available. I promise I\u2019ll be nicer than Britney\u2019s dad re: your spending habits. :)",

Tons of profiles (none of which are ever more than 3-4 days old because they get blocked) ask for deposits early in the conversation.  It's not only the worst kind of transactional it's pennies relative to what's available if you're on SA for the right reasons, and also only total frauds that try and do it for the most part!\n\nIt is really easy not to get scammed initially whether you're a SB or SD the rules are the same: 1). Do not ever send funds to someone you don't know and have not met. 2) Do not ever give bank info, or personal information to anyone you haven't met......or ever for that matter 3) Charitable donation in currency initially.  Period.........there you go. BOOM no more scamming!  If you're whining about a date being late or not showing up every SD has been there so join the club.",

So the only way to ensure that I know who I'm talking to - and they have the same knowledge - is to meet in person, or to have a live video chat. I am not sharing my face otherwise to random people who ask, for the off chance that I may or may not end up meeting them. That is not total discretion.\n\n>I'm quite sure you and I will never meet. \n\nI'll be forever sad about that! /s",

Yes, I normally have a token gift to cover transit and parking for an SB at the M&G, but it is a gift and not a requirement.",

People are free to text or not text and I'm respectful of their time. I find that they initiate conversations more than I do. They can stay or move on. \n\n\nIt seems like people are going to waste the time one way or another. Either wasting time texting that goes no where or wasting time with meet and greets that go nowhere. I sugar in another town, so I don't have time for wasted meet and greets.\n\n\n I'm not jerking anyone around. I'm clear and specific about what I offer early on (allowance, times etc). I just don't see the point of meeting unless the potential is there. I see it as efficiently. Don't we have posts on here all the time about wasting time on pointless meet and greets? Or people start talking Monday, have a meet and greet Wednesday, and then get pump and dumped or scammed on Friday?\n\n\nI'm not claiming my way is the only way, just the way that has worked for me for nearly two decades of great long SRs. I'm sure I lose pots along the way. That's ok. Enough of them find my upfront and clear style refreshing that I find what I'm looking for. I get a lot of interest I suspect because I'm very polite. I don't ask for nudes, talk dirty, sext, etc. Maybe that makes me seem more legit? In the last decade I have had exactly 1 meet and greet that didn't end up in a SR. I also never pump and dump and I only have SB and treat her very, very well. Oldschoolsd right?\n\n\nI also suspect I get a lot interest and patience because I show genuine interest in them.\n\nWhen Chuchill's mother had dinner with Gladstone and Disraeli, she said, \"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.\"\n\n\nI will admit I haven't tried video chatting much so I might try that down the road. Its newer to me because I tend to have long SRs. \n\n\nI know there is a lot frustration in the bowl and it is getting worse. Maybe the current popular practice isn't working. I don't have a good answer to it for other people. I just have an answer for myself.",

People are free to text or not text and I'm respectful of their time. I find that they initiate conversations more than I do. They can stay or move on. \n\n\nIt seems like people are going to waste the time one way or another. Either wasting time texting that goes no where or wasting time with meet and greets that go nowhere. I sugar in another town, so I don't have time for wasted meet and greets.\n\n\n I'm not jerking anyone around. I'm clear and specific about what I offer early on (allowance, times etc). I just don't see the point of meeting unless the potential is there. I see it as efficiently. Don't we have posts on here all the time about wasting time on pointless meet and greets? Or people start talking Monday, have a meet and greet Wednesday, and then get pump and dumped or scammed on Friday?\n\n\nI'm not claiming my way is the only way, just the way that has worked for me for nearly two decades of great long SRs. I'm sure I lose pots along the way. That's ok. Enough of them find my upfront and clear style refreshing that I find what I'm looking for. I get a lot of interest I suspect because I'm very polite. I don't ask for nudes, talk dirty, sext, etc. Maybe that makes me seem more legit? In the last decade I have had exactly 1 meet and greet that didn't end up in a SR. I also never pump and dump and I only have SB and treat her very, very well. Oldschoolsd right?\n\n\nI also suspect I get a lot interest and patience because I show genuine interest in them.\n\nWhen Chuchill's mother had dinner with Gladstone and Disraeli, she said, \"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.\"\n\n\nI will admit I haven't tried video chatting much so I might try that down the road. Its newer to me because I tend to have long SRs. \n\n\nI know there is a lot frustration in the bowl and it is getting worse. Maybe the current popular practice isn't working. I don't have a good answer to it for other people. I just have an answer for myself.",

I'll promise a smaller cash allowance just for the meet sometimes and those have been maybe 50/50 at best.\n\nfor SBs not wasting time on a meet and greet, just try to schedule quick coffee/dessert dates or walking around a public area.  don't agree to an entire dinner date the first time. make the SD come to a public place NEAR YOU for a quick meet. could leave in 5minutes or if it goes well, u can always migrate to dinner or whatever. I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",

We could discuss strategies to avoid toe dipping and people who have no intention of meeting in person in another thread. \n\nFor me it\u2019s about the dynamic of the intended relationship, I\u2019m not looking for a generic SB so demanding a paid M&G might be a good strategy for people that want a different dynamic than what I\u2019m looking for.",

So the only way to ensure that I know who I'm talking to - and they have the same knowledge - is to meet in person, or to have a live video chat. I am not sharing my face otherwise to random people who ask, for the off chance that I may or may not end up meeting them. That is not total discretion.\n\n>I'm quite sure you and I will never meet. \n\nI'll be forever sad about that! /s",

People are free to text or not text and I'm respectful of their time. I find that they initiate conversations more than I do. They can stay or move on. \n\n\nIt seems like people are going to waste the time one way or another. Either wasting time texting that goes no where or wasting time with meet and greets that go nowhere. I sugar in another town, so I don't have time for wasted meet and greets.\n\n\n I'm not jerking anyone around. I'm clear and specific about what I offer early on (allowance, times etc). I just don't see the point of meeting unless the potential is there. I see it as efficiently. Don't we have posts on here all the time about wasting time on pointless meet and greets? Or people start talking Monday, have a meet and greet Wednesday, and then get pump and dumped or scammed on Friday?\n\n\nI'm not claiming my way is the only way, just the way that has worked for me for nearly two decades of great long SRs. I'm sure I lose pots along the way. That's ok. Enough of them find my upfront and clear style refreshing that I find what I'm looking for. I get a lot of interest I suspect because I'm very polite. I don't ask for nudes, talk dirty, sext, etc. Maybe that makes me seem more legit? In the last decade I have had exactly 1 meet and greet that didn't end up in a SR. I also never pump and dump and I only have SB and treat her very, very well. Oldschoolsd right?\n\n\nI also suspect I get a lot interest and patience because I show genuine interest in them.\n\nWhen Chuchill's mother had dinner with Gladstone and Disraeli, she said, \"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.\"\n\n\nI will admit I haven't tried video chatting much so I might try that down the road. Its newer to me because I tend to have long SRs. \n\n\nI know there is a lot frustration in the bowl and it is getting worse. Maybe the current popular practice isn't working. I don't have a good answer to it for other people. I just have an answer for myself.",

People are free to text or not text and I'm respectful of their time. I find that they initiate conversations more than I do. They can stay or move on. \n\n\nIt seems like people are going to waste the time one way or another. Either wasting time texting that goes no where or wasting time with meet and greets that go nowhere. I sugar in another town, so I don't have time for wasted meet and greets.\n\n\n I'm not jerking anyone around. I'm clear and specific about what I offer early on (allowance, times etc). I just don't see the point of meeting unless the potential is there. I see it as efficiently. Don't we have posts on here all the time about wasting time on pointless meet and greets? Or people start talking Monday, have a meet and greet Wednesday, and then get pump and dumped or scammed on Friday?\n\n\nI'm not claiming my way is the only way, just the way that has worked for me for nearly two decades of great long SRs. I'm sure I lose pots along the way. That's ok. Enough of them find my upfront and clear style refreshing that I find what I'm looking for. I get a lot of interest I suspect because I'm very polite. I don't ask for nudes, talk dirty, sext, etc. Maybe that makes me seem more legit? In the last decade I have had exactly 1 meet and greet that didn't end up in a SR. I also never pump and dump and I only have SB and treat her very, very well. Oldschoolsd right?\n\n\nI also suspect I get a lot interest and patience because I show genuine interest in them.\n\nWhen Chuchill's mother had dinner with Gladstone and Disraeli, she said, \"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.\"\n\n\nI will admit I haven't tried video chatting much so I might try that down the road. Its newer to me because I tend to have long SRs. \n\n\nI know there is a lot frustration in the bowl and it is getting worse. Maybe the current popular practice isn't working. I don't have a good answer to it for other people. I just have an answer for myself.",

I'll promise a smaller cash allowance just for the meet sometimes and those have been maybe 50/50 at best.\n\nfor SBs not wasting time on a meet and greet, just try to schedule quick coffee/dessert dates or walking around a public area.  don't agree to an entire dinner date the first time. make the SD come to a public place NEAR YOU for a quick meet. could leave in 5minutes or if it goes well, u can always migrate to dinner or whatever. I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",

One is just a few bucks, the other is my [privacy and discretion](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/lylgbx/sb_109_thoughts_from_an_sb_who_never_share_my/). \n\nIf I am sharing with someone what I look like - I need to see what they look like too at the same time - and *I do not trust pictures* \\- plenty of pictures have been stolen off of social media and locked/private pictures from friend's accounts by people, and I've been recipients of stolen pictures too many times. So the only way to ensure that I know who I'm talking to - and they have the same knowledge - is to meet in person, or to have a live video chat. I am not sharing my face otherwise to random people who ask, for the off chance that I may or may not end up meeting them. That is not total discretion.\n\n>I'm quite sure you and I will never meet. \n\nI'll be forever sad about that! /s",

I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",

I'll promise a smaller cash allowance just for the meet sometimes and those have been maybe 50/50 at best.\n\nfor SBs not wasting time on a meet and greet, just try to schedule quick coffee/dessert dates or walking around a public area.  don't agree to an entire dinner date the first time. make the SD come to a public place NEAR YOU for a quick meet. could leave in 5minutes or if it goes well, u can always migrate to dinner or whatever. I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",

I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",

I'll promise a smaller cash allowance just for the meet sometimes and those have been maybe 50/50 at best.\n\nfor SBs not wasting time on a meet and greet, just try to schedule quick coffee/dessert dates or walking around a public area.  don't agree to an entire dinner date the first time. make the SD come to a public place NEAR YOU for a quick meet. could leave in 5minutes or if it goes well, u can always migrate to dinner or whatever. I might expect an SB to come to me for the most part but I've never not been willing to go to them to make it as comfortable and easy for them the first time we meet.  any SD that is unwilling is probably gonna be a douschebag. and don't ask for an allowance just for the meet. most respecting SDs will gift you if he really wants to see you again.",
