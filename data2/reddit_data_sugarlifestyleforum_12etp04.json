At the end we hugged and she skated away,,,I stood there thinking WTF just happened.",

                            "body": "sadly true but in the reverse...\n\nIn the 1982 movie Venice Beach, the young runaway Diane flees to Los Angeles and tries to survive being homeless on the streets of Venice Beach, California after abandoning her small home town to escape her irresponsible and promiscuous mother. Once there, she loses all her money and luggage and is forced to live in the streets of Venice among many other people who come to California to find their dreams only to find despair.\n\nIn the real life case I encountered, the young girl can't stand being around her devout, churchgoing, shaming, controlling, overpopulated family environment and so escapes to lead a life of perceived fun, irresponsible promiscuity, drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll. Because she was amazingly pretty, calm, well spoken and seemingly mature beyond her years, I did not at first realize the ever present hurricane inside her mind. Eventually, the stories got back to me and the tell tale scars told their own stories. \n\nAs I mentioned, this was on and off. She would disappear for long periods of time, only to surface with an SMS and a smile, sometimes after a fling with one of my friends. The candle burned too strongly. R.I.P. 10 years after. A few of us went to the funeral. Mom found the text messages. We sat in the back but couldn't bring ourselves to interact with the huge family afterwards. We didn't want to have to make up any stories other than 'met through mutual friends'.\n\n***Candle in the Wind, by Elton John***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYU3F8uUGiw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYU3F8uUGiw)\n\nGoodbye, Norma Jeane\n\nThough I never knew you at all\n\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\n\nWhile those around you crawled\n\nThey crawled out of the woodwork\n\nAnd they whispered into your brain\n\nThey set you on the treadmill\n\nAnd they made you change your name\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And it seems to me you lived your life***\n\n***Like a candle in the wind***\n\n***Never knowing who to cling to***\n\n***When the rain set in***\n\n***And I would've liked to know you***\n\n***But I was just a kid***\n\n***Your candle burned out long before***\n\n***Your legend ever did***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoneliness was tough\n\nThe toughest role you ever played\n\nHollywood created a superstar\n\nAnd pain was the price you paid\n\nEven when you died\n\nOh, the press still hounded you\n\nAll the papers had to say\n\nWas that Marilyn was found in the nude\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And it seems to me you lived your life***\n\n***Like a candle in the wind***\n\n***Never knowing who to cling to***\n\n***When the rain set in***\n\n***And I would've liked to know you***\n\n***But I was just a kid***\n\n***Your candle burned out long before***\n\n***Your legend ever did***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodbye, Norma Jeane\n\nThough I never knew you at all\n\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\n\nWhile those around you crawled\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Goodbye, Norma Jeane***\n\n***From the young man in the twenty second row***\n\n***Who sees you as something more than sexual***\n\n***More than just our Marilyn Monroe***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\n\nLike a candle in the wind\n\nNever knowing who to cling to\n\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd I would've liked to know you\n\nBut I was just a kid\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: LyricFind\n\nSongwriters: Bernie Taupin / Elton John\n\nCandle In The Wind lyrics \u00a9 Universal Music Publishing Group",

Once there, she loses all her money and luggage and is forced to live in the streets of Venice among many other people who come to California to find their dreams only to find despair.\n\nIn the real life case I encountered, the young girl can't stand being around her devout, churchgoing, shaming, controlling, overpopulated family environment and so escapes to lead a life of perceived fun, irresponsible promiscuity, drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll. Because she was amazingly pretty, calm, well spoken and seemingly mature beyond her years, I did not at first realize the ever present hurricane inside her mind. Eventually, the stories got back to me and the tell tale scars told their own stories. \n\nAs I mentioned, this was on and off. She would disappear for long periods of time, only to surface with an SMS and a smile, sometimes after a fling with one of my friends. The candle burned too strongly. R.I.P. 10 years after. A few of us went to the funeral. Mom found the text messages. We sat in the back but couldn't bring ourselves to interact with the huge family afterwards. We didn't want to have to make up any stories other than 'met through mutual friends'.\n\n***Candle in the Wind, by Elton John***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYU3F8uUGiw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYU3F8uUGiw)\n\nGoodbye, Norma Jeane\n\nThough I never knew you at all\n\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\n\nWhile those around you crawled\n\nThey crawled out of the woodwork\n\nAnd they whispered into your brain\n\nThey set you on the treadmill\n\nAnd they made you change your name\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And it seems to me you lived your life***\n\n***Like a candle in the wind***\n\n***Never knowing who to cling to***\n\n***When the rain set in***\n\n***And I would've liked to know you***\n\n***But I was just a kid***\n\n***Your candle burned out long before***\n\n***Your legend ever did***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoneliness was tough\n\nThe toughest role you ever played\n\nHollywood created a superstar\n\nAnd pain was the price you paid\n\nEven when you died\n\nOh, the press still hounded you\n\nAll the papers had to say\n\nWas that Marilyn was found in the nude\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And it seems to me you lived your life***\n\n***Like a candle in the wind***\n\n***Never knowing who to cling to***\n\n***When the rain set in***\n\n***And I would've liked to know you***\n\n***But I was just a kid***\n\n***Your candle burned out long before***\n\n***Your legend ever did***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodbye, Norma Jeane\n\nThough I never knew you at all\n\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\n\nWhile those around you crawled\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Goodbye, Norma Jeane***\n\n***From the young man in the twenty second row***\n\n***Who sees you as something more than sexual***\n\n***More than just our Marilyn Monroe***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\n\nLike a candle in the wind\n\nNever knowing who to cling to\n\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd I would've liked to know you\n\nBut I was just a kid\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: LyricFind\n\nSongwriters: Bernie Taupin / Elton John\n\nCandle In The Wind lyrics \u00a9 Universal Music Publishing Group",

Once there, she loses all her money and luggage and is forced to live in the streets of Venice among many other people who come to California to find their dreams only to find despair.\n\nIn the real life case I encountered, the young girl can't stand being around her devout, churchgoing, shaming, controlling, overpopulated family environment and so escapes to lead a life of perceived fun, irresponsible promiscuity, drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll. Because she was amazingly pretty, calm, well spoken and seemingly mature beyond her years, I did not at first realize the ever present hurricane inside her mind. Eventually, the stories got back to me and the tell tale scars told their own stories. \n\nAs I mentioned, this was on and off. She would disappear for long periods of time, only to surface with an SMS and a smile, sometimes after a fling with one of my friends. The candle burned too strongly. R.I.P. 10 years after. A few of us went to the funeral. Mom found the text messages. We sat in the back but couldn't bring ourselves to interact with the huge family afterwards. We didn't want to have to make up any stories other than 'met through mutual friends'.\n\n***Candle in the Wind, by Elton John***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYU3F8uUGiw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYU3F8uUGiw)\n\nGoodbye, Norma Jeane\n\nThough I never knew you at all\n\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\n\nWhile those around you crawled\n\nThey crawled out of the woodwork\n\nAnd they whispered into your brain\n\nThey set you on the treadmill\n\nAnd they made you change your name\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And it seems to me you lived your life***\n\n***Like a candle in the wind***\n\n***Never knowing who to cling to***\n\n***When the rain set in***\n\n***And I would've liked to know you***\n\n***But I was just a kid***\n\n***Your candle burned out long before***\n\n***Your legend ever did***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoneliness was tough\n\nThe toughest role you ever played\n\nHollywood created a superstar\n\nAnd pain was the price you paid\n\nEven when you died\n\nOh, the press still hounded you\n\nAll the papers had to say\n\nWas that Marilyn was found in the nude\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And it seems to me you lived your life***\n\n***Like a candle in the wind***\n\n***Never knowing who to cling to***\n\n***When the rain set in***\n\n***And I would've liked to know you***\n\n***But I was just a kid***\n\n***Your candle burned out long before***\n\n***Your legend ever did***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodbye, Norma Jeane\n\nThough I never knew you at all\n\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\n\nWhile those around you crawled\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Goodbye, Norma Jeane***\n\n***From the young man in the twenty second row***\n\n***Who sees you as something more than sexual***\n\n***More than just our Marilyn Monroe***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\n\nLike a candle in the wind\n\nNever knowing who to cling to\n\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd I would've liked to know you\n\nBut I was just a kid\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: LyricFind\n\nSongwriters: Bernie Taupin / Elton John\n\nCandle In The Wind lyrics \u00a9 Universal Music Publishing Group",
