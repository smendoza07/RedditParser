I\u2019ve heard this so much over the years and I\u2019ve encountered countless age lies from men. It\u2019s like they almost feel entitled to shave five years off their age. Often much more. 10 or more years is delusional in most cases. \n\nI don\u2019t see women acting the same way.  The overwhelming majority of people look within a few years of their age.  I would argue women often look better for their age due to better skincare and other self care routines.  I can tell you that if women regularly pulled this shit the way men do, they\u2019d be verbally beat down into oblivion. Women are far too permissive about this type of lie. \n\nOP is 100% correct on this one.",

Often much more. 10 or more years is delusional in most cases. \n\nI don\u2019t see women acting the same way.  The overwhelming majority of people look within a few years of their age.  I would argue women often look better for their age due to better skincare and other self care routines.  I can tell you that if women regularly pulled this shit the way men do, they\u2019d be verbally beat down into oblivion. Women are far too permissive about this type of lie. \n\nOP is 100% correct on this one.",
