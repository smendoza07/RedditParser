When I was your age, idk if reddit existed but I do know that I didn\u2019t spend much time on the internet chatting with randos. Not saying this to make you feel bad, but just to remind you (cause we all need a reminder every once in a while, especially 14 year olds) that this world wasn\u2019t built on online interactions. The internet is convenient but there\u2019s something missing from online messages compared to real life. I also wanna remind you that you\u2019re posting your face online, and that once you do that, it\u2019s done. No going back - those pics belong to the world now. People protect their identity on reddit for a good reason and I\u2019m not sure if my 14 year old self would\u2019ve known or thought about this. Anyway, just wanted to remind you! Hope this is received well",
