It has regrown my hair almost 75% making it look so much better. I have not experienced any hormonal changes or side effects but I normally eat very healthy and supplement daily because I am also wary of putting unnatural things into my body. I also take a biotin supplement and use OGX biotin and Collagen shampoo&conditioner every 3 days. Use a blow dryer on coldest setting to make your hair look thicker and fuller.\n\nIf you are considering starting this process the time is now or never because finesteride will not regrow your hair to 100% original state but it will stop hair loss immediately so you want to start now for the best possible results.",

I also take a biotin supplement and use OGX biotin and Collagen shampoo&conditioner every 3 days. Use a blow dryer on coldest setting to make your hair look thicker and fuller.\n\nIf you are considering starting this process the time is now or never because finesteride will not regrow your hair to 100% original state but it will stop hair loss immediately so you want to start now for the best possible results.",

It has regrown my hair almost 75% making it look so much better. I have not experienced any hormonal changes or side effects but I normally eat very healthy and supplement daily because I am also wary of putting unnatural things into my body. I also take a biotin supplement and use OGX biotin and Collagen shampoo&conditioner every 3 days. Use a blow dryer on coldest setting to make your hair look thicker and fuller.\n\nIf you are considering starting this process the time is now or never because finesteride will not regrow your hair to 100% original state but it will stop hair loss immediately so you want to start now for the best possible results.",
