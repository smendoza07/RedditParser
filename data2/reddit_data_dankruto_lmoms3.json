Both take their weaknesses and make them their strengths. Both are injured after going too far and both recover and perfect their skills. Both almost lose their father figures. Both are rejected by their generation in some way, naruto more than Lee, but get past that. Pretty much the same character arcs and similar suffering except one is better because he has a bowl cut",

Everything that happens in a story MUST have two reasons for it to even enter the conversation of a good move. You should always ask your self \"Why?\" twice, when wondering the reasons of something in a story. Let me give an example of sage mode Naruto.\n\n-Why was Naruto able to defeat Pain?\n\n-Because Kishi said so\n\n-But how was he able to?\n\n-He trained really hard to master the rasenshuriken and sage mode\n\nSee what I mean? I know I asked how instead of why, but you get the gist. If you aren't able to answer the second \"why?\" question, it was a horrible move. Can anyone answer the second \"why?\" question, with a logical answer, on how Sakura can have a spark of development, then do a complete 180.\n\nExample: Going from having a huge part in defeating a mid tier akatsuki member, to getting folded by a chuunin",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path.

The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down.

I know you said he was caught off guard, which is a valid point, but that doesn't mean Sakura wouldn't be able to catch one of the weaker pains off guard\n\nBecause she's not smart enough to outspeed them and land a hit, again she always rush's in battle and expects the best outcome.\n\n>Naruto literally did exactly that throughout the battle.\n\nNaruto with sm was literally faster than pain rewatch the fight lmao, he had the speed advantage.\n\n>The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side,\n\nAgain speed is a factor, at this point she's not fast, and all pain needs to do is distract her with summons and she's fucked.\n\n>We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nNigga what are you on abt??? I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nThe only way I can see Hinata being a good character is if she died instead of Neji and her telling Neji and Naruto that she wanted to protect the people she cared about the most. Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

The rest go down to sage mode Naruto's punches or a Rasenshurkien. But since the Asura path was taken out by a single punch and is generally considered to be the second strongest I see no reason why the others wouldn't go down too. \n\n\nAlso the fight between 7 tails Naruto and Tendo doesn't go down the same way in the Manga as in the Anime. That's why the animation is so different. In the Manga Tendo busts out the Chabaku Tensei basically right away.",

Are you seriously asking me was Naruto and Kakashi thrown away when Sakura defeated Sasori as if they weren't fighting Deidera? What exactly was Sakura doing while Naruto was fighting? Crying out for him. \n2. Kakashi lost to the 2 strongest Pains with no intel\n3. Ah yes, it's not like Naruto could have had Sakura as backup. It's not like they are part of a team or anything.\n4. I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

The more the story progresses with new characters being introduced, the more harder it is for Kishimoto to carry his previous characters, in a way, onto the next arcs. And that his solely Kishimoto\u2019s fault.\n\nThe hard truth is that Naruto story wise, isn\u2019t that great. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really enjoyed the entire the Akatsuki story and Kakashi/Itachi are one of the best characters in Anime, but the there are many terrible aspects in the story & many plotholes, with previous writing being retconned constantly. But the main reason I stayed through the entire show was because of the great world building, battles and the emotional aspect of the series. But that does not excuse all the negative aspects.",

Both take their weaknesses and make them their strengths. Both are injured after going too far and both recover and perfect their skills. Both almost lose their father figures. Both are rejected by their generation in some way, naruto more than Lee, but get past that. Pretty much the same character arcs and similar suffering except one is better because he has a bowl cut",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path. So if Naruto can one shot one of the stronger paths with an attack that doesn't appear to hit as hard as Sakura's I see no reason why she couldn't one shot the non-combat paths.",

The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down. We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nAre you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?",

I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

Like honestly could you tell me the goals of any of the Rookie 9 besides Naruto and Sauske? If you expand it to the Konha 11 prior to the retrieval then it's Lee and Naruto with the concrete goal.  The problem gets fixed to a degree right before the time skip and shippuden. Sakura wants to get stronger so she can help Naruto in the future along with not being the weakest link in team Kakashi, Ino wants to compete with Sakura, Shikamaru discoveres the Will of Fire and his desire to prevent his friend's from dying, Shino is being there for his friends, kiba to get stronger in order for Akamaru to never be hurt as badly again, Choji wanted to get stronger so he wouldn't be the weak link again, tenten we got a whole filler episode about her goals to become the strongest Kunochi, Neji to make his own fate and be better to friends and family, and Hinata I guess is wanting to marry Naruto; she definitely has the weakest goal.",

That's why the animation is so different. In the Manga Tendo busts out the Chabaku Tensei basically right away.",

It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really enjoyed the entire the Akatsuki story and Kakashi/Itachi are one of the best characters in Anime, but the there are many terrible aspects in the story & many plotholes, with previous writing being retconned constantly. But the main reason I stayed through the entire show was because of the great world building, battles and the emotional aspect of the series. But that does not excuse all the negative aspects.",

When in reality, Naruto wants to save Sasuke because they've been linked by fate, and both now what pain feels like.\n\nYou can criticize the fandom of doing this everywhere too, or hating Sakura because of Studio Pierrot's pacing, and additional scenes that make her look incompetent",

Both take their weaknesses and make them their strengths. Both are injured after going too far and both recover and perfect their skills. Both almost lose their father figures. Both are rejected by their generation in some way, naruto more than Lee, but get past that. Pretty much the same character arcs and similar suffering except one is better because he has a bowl cut",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path. So if Naruto can one shot one of the stronger paths with an attack that doesn't appear to hit as hard as Sakura's I see no reason why she couldn't one shot the non-combat paths.",

I know you said he was caught off guard, which is a valid point, but that doesn't mean Sakura wouldn't be able to catch one of the weaker pains off guard\n\nBecause she's not smart enough to outspeed them and land a hit, again she always rush's in battle and expects the best outcome.\n\n>Naruto literally did exactly that throughout the battle.\n\nNaruto with sm was literally faster than pain rewatch the fight lmao, he had the speed advantage.\n\n>The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side,\n\nAgain speed is a factor, at this point she's not fast, and all pain needs to do is distract her with summons and she's fucked.\n\n>We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nNigga what are you on abt??? I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

She has the same striking power as Tsunade in base. \n\nI'm just going to link the Naruto explained video, https://youtu.be/-1qfb-L_SkI\n\nThe title is kind of misleading but they do highlight a number of moments  before the war Arc which shows how much Sakura cares for Naruto. Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nThe only way I can see Hinata being a good character is if she died instead of Neji and her telling Neji and Naruto that she wanted to protect the people she cared about the most. Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

The rest go down to sage mode Naruto's punches or a Rasenshurkien. But since the Asura path was taken out by a single punch and is generally considered to be the second strongest I see no reason why the others wouldn't go down too. \n\n\nAlso the fight between 7 tails Naruto and Tendo doesn't go down the same way in the Manga as in the Anime. That's why the animation is so different. In the Manga Tendo busts out the Chabaku Tensei basically right away.",

It's not like they are part of a team or anything.\n4. I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

Both take their weaknesses and make them their strengths. Both are injured after going too far and both recover and perfect their skills. Both almost lose their father figures. Both are rejected by their generation in some way, naruto more than Lee, but get past that. Pretty much the same character arcs and similar suffering except one is better because he has a bowl cut",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path.

The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down. We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nAre you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?",

I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nThe only way I can see Hinata being a good character is if she died instead of Neji and her telling Neji and Naruto that she wanted to protect the people she cared about the most. Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

Like honestly could you tell me the goals of any of the Rookie 9 besides Naruto and Sauske? If you expand it to the Konha 11 prior to the retrieval then it's Lee and Naruto with the concrete goal.  The problem gets fixed to a degree right before the time skip and shippuden. Sakura wants to get stronger so she can help Naruto in the future along with not being the weakest link in team Kakashi, Ino wants to compete with Sakura, Shikamaru discoveres the Will of Fire and his desire to prevent his friend's from dying, Shino is being there for his friends, kiba to get stronger in order for Akamaru to never be hurt as badly again, Choji wanted to get stronger so he wouldn't be the weak link again, tenten we got a whole filler episode about her goals to become the strongest Kunochi, Neji to make his own fate and be better to friends and family, and Hinata I guess is wanting to marry Naruto; she definitely has the weakest goal.",

The rest go down to sage mode Naruto's punches or a Rasenshurkien.

That's why the animation is so different. In the Manga Tendo busts out the Chabaku Tensei basically right away.",

I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

Both take their weaknesses and make them their strengths. Both are injured after going too far and both recover and perfect their skills. Both almost lose their father figures. Both are rejected by their generation in some way, naruto more than Lee, but get past that. Pretty much the same character arcs and similar suffering except one is better because he has a bowl cut",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path.

I know you said he was caught off guard, which is a valid point, but that doesn't mean Sakura wouldn't be able to catch one of the weaker pains off guard. Naruto literally did exactly that throughout the battle.\n\nOnce again, the point isn't that she would win against Pain. She would get wrecked. The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down. We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nAre you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?",

I know you said he was caught off guard, which is a valid point, but that doesn't mean Sakura wouldn't be able to catch one of the weaker pains off guard\n\nBecause she's not smart enough to outspeed them and land a hit, again she always rush's in battle and expects the best outcome.\n\n>Naruto literally did exactly that throughout the battle.\n\nNaruto with sm was literally faster than pain rewatch the fight lmao, he had the speed advantage.\n\n>The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side,\n\nAgain speed is a factor, at this point she's not fast, and all pain needs to do is distract her with summons and she's fucked.\n\n>We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nNigga what are you on abt??? I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

She has the same striking power as Tsunade in base. \n\nI'm just going to link the Naruto explained video, https://youtu.be/-1qfb-L_SkI\n\nThe title is kind of misleading but they do highlight a number of moments  before the war Arc which shows how much Sakura cares for Naruto. Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nThe only way I can see Hinata being a good character is if she died instead of Neji and her telling Neji and Naruto that she wanted to protect the people she cared about the most. Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path.

Naruto literally did exactly that throughout the battle.\n\nOnce again, the point isn't that she would win against Pain. She would get wrecked. The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down. We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nAre you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?",

I know you said he was caught off guard, which is a valid point, but that doesn't mean Sakura wouldn't be able to catch one of the weaker pains off guard\n\nBecause she's not smart enough to outspeed them and land a hit, again she always rush's in battle and expects the best outcome.\n\n>Naruto literally did exactly that throughout the battle.\n\nNaruto with sm was literally faster than pain rewatch the fight lmao, he had the speed advantage.\n\n>The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side,\n\nAgain speed is a factor, at this point she's not fast, and all pain needs to do is distract her with summons and she's fucked.\n\n>We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nNigga what are you on abt??? I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

She has the same striking power as Tsunade in base. \n\nI'm just going to link the Naruto explained video, https://youtu.be/-1qfb-L_SkI\n\nThe title is kind of misleading but they do highlight a number of moments  before the war Arc which shows how much Sakura cares for Naruto. Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nThe only way I can see Hinata being a good character is if she died instead of Neji and her telling Neji and Naruto that she wanted to protect the people she cared about the most. Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

She has the same striking power as Tsunade in base. \n\nIf any of this is true why TF was she abt to be killed by a regular kunai attack by sasuke, that total bs LMFAO \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n>Sakura cares for Naruto. Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nFam there are so many other people that supported naruto way more than sakura did, also that's not her being a good character, she had an incomplete arc. Also that isn't her dream that's just her being supportive do naruto, what goals does she have??? Oh wait she doesn't have any",

Sakura wants to get stronger so she can help Naruto in the future along with not being the weakest link in team Kakashi, Ino wants to compete with Sakura, Shikamaru discoveres the Will of Fire and his desire to prevent his friend's from dying, Shino is being there for his friends, kiba to get stronger in order for Akamaru to never be hurt as badly again, Choji wanted to get stronger so he wouldn't be the weak link again, tenten we got a whole filler episode about her goals to become the strongest Kunochi, Neji to make his own fate and be better to friends and family, and Hinata I guess is wanting to marry Naruto; she definitely has the weakest goal.",

That's why the animation is so different. In the Manga Tendo busts out the Chabaku Tensei basically right away.",

It's not like they are part of a team or anything.\n4. I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path. So if Naruto can one shot one of the stronger paths with an attack that doesn't appear to hit as hard as Sakura's I see no reason why she couldn't one shot the non-combat paths.",

The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down. We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nAre you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

It's not like they are part of a team or anything.\n4. I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path. So if Naruto can one shot one of the stronger paths with an attack that doesn't appear to hit as hard as Sakura's I see no reason why she couldn't one shot the non-combat paths.",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

The problem gets fixed to a degree right before the time skip and shippuden. Sakura wants to get stronger so she can help Naruto in the future along with not being the weakest link in team Kakashi, Ino wants to compete with Sakura, Shikamaru discoveres the Will of Fire and his desire to prevent his friend's from dying, Shino is being there for his friends, kiba to get stronger in order for Akamaru to never be hurt as badly again, Choji wanted to get stronger so he wouldn't be the weak link again, tenten we got a whole filler episode about her goals to become the strongest Kunochi, Neji to make his own fate and be better to friends and family, and Hinata I guess is wanting to marry Naruto; she definitely has the weakest goal.",

It's not like they are part of a team or anything.\n4. I think you should refer to my first comment, the one that started this thread, if you are finding it difficult to understand why I think Kishimoto threw Sakura away for this arc. It make sense why Guy and Lee were unable to fight the pains, because they were on a mission. What exactly was preventing Sakura from coming onto the field and helping Naruto when Hinata, a medic ninja, did exactly that, though a bit too late to do anything significant",

Almost certainly no. \n\nCould Sakura land a hit on the Naraka, Human or Preta paths? Probably. Would that one shot them? Well Naruto one hit the Asura Path in Sage mode. And Tsunade and Sakura were both shown to be strong enough to destroy entire landscapes in single hits, which Naruto did not do when he hit the Asura path. So if Naruto can one shot one of the stronger paths with an attack that doesn't appear to hit as hard as Sakura's I see no reason why she couldn't one shot the non-combat paths.",

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly).

Her character arc goes up and down, it isn't an arc it's inconsistent asf, and her whole character is based around sasuke, she was abt to move away from sasuke and become an independent character, but then she goes to kill him without a plan, but still doesn't go through with it because SHE GOT FUCKING SCARED. The thing abt hinata is that she actually and a reason for long naruto and was abt to have a good arc, but she never moved away from naruto, she only becomes courageous FOR naruto, she's only brave FOR naruto, there was a scene in the manga basically foreshadowing her standing up to her father's unrealistic expectations, but it's never explored but at least she has a base for a good character arc, but with Sakura she doesn't have any goals beside sasuke, she wants to be with sasuke, she wants to strong so she can stand by sasuke, it's so fucking stupid, again sakura and hinata were bother terribly written but sakura was much worse because kishi basically gave up on her character after the pain arc because ppl were showing discontent towards her character",

She has the same striking power as Tsunade in base. \n\nI'm just going to link the Naruto explained video, https://youtu.be/-1qfb-L_SkI\n\nThe title is kind of misleading but they do highlight a number of moments  before the war Arc which shows how much Sakura cares for Naruto. Such as willing to forfeit her own chances at being a Chunin to protect Naruto's dream, to get stronger in order to help Naruto against Sauske, how other people recognized that she cared for Naruto in a way that was beyond friendship, and how heartfelt and genuine her hug and gratitude was after the battle with Pain. \n\nThe only way I can see Hinata being a good character is if she died instead of Neji and her telling Neji and Naruto that she wanted to protect the people she cared about the most. Along with saying that she is happy so long as Naruto is happy in a reflection of the selfless love Naruto feels for Sakura and Jirayia feels for Tsunade (that last one may be filler, I can't remember exactly). But basically it's a reversal of the whole branch family must die doe her main household and an exploration of the selfless love that is a subtle theme.",

The point is Naruto may not have needed the nine tails power to beat pain if he had Sakura by his side, since he would have been able to finish the battle before the cool down. We know that the cool down is AT LEAST 15 minutes long, since it lasted more than 3 full sage mode transformations which last 5 minutes each.\n\nAre you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?",

I'm talking abt the almighty push cooldown, it's stated multiple times to be 5 SECONDS, sakura is not that fast ffs.\n\n>Are you seriously telling me the same person who was dodging a large group of puppets unassisted (later half of the fight) wouldn't be able to land a critical blow on ANY Pain?\n\nYes, sakura only dodged the puppets because for most of the fight chiyo was controlling her, so she learned their moveset, NOT because she was faster than them",
