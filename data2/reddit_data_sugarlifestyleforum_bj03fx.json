    "body": "Just went on a first date with a guy from one of those swiping apps. His profile seemed pretty generic and half his photos were hot so I thought I'd give it a shot and see how he looks/acts in person. Well, as the date goes on, it slowly starts coming out that he's rich. Granted, he's around my age, so this might not seem a ton to someone decades older than us, but he's somewhere in high 6 figures, low 7 figures annual income plus owning several different properties.  \n\nI didn't even realize it until it was over, but the more I picked up on his wealth, the more I subconsciously slid back into SB mode. Be *extra* charming. Be *extra* playful when laughing at his jokes. Let him touch me even if I'm not sure how I feel about it. Fantasize about future trips we might take together. And it was *fun*. \n\nBut now I'm sitting here thinking \"Wait a second do I actually like him? Or did I just enjoy that memory trip down SB lane? Or maybe this mean I miss the thrill from sugaring? But also, do I like him?!\" I am very confused. \n\nThis happen to any other SBs? Maybe even SDs lol?",

At the same time I have sugar arrangements and I'm in the hunt for a new SD to replace mine that are too busy to meet. \n\nI recently had two vanilla dates that went well. Early on in the dates I could tell that he made a lot of money. Immediately my mind went into sugar mode. Just like you said, \"Be extra charming, casually touch his arm or leg, laugh a lot, fantasize about trips and fancy meals.\" \n\nI have to say, it was also nice to be out with guys closer to my age whom I was physically attracted to for once.  But even that was difficult...the one guy and I totally hit it off. I found him very attractive and it was nice to have that feeling of pure lust and attraction that I rarely feel in the sugar bowl. We spent 5 or 6 hours together on the date and when I gave him a goodnight kiss in his car, I was much more sexually brazen than I usually am on the first date. I asked him about kinks and fetishes and I grabbed his dick as I left, things I've never done on a vanilla first date!\n\n I had to constantly remind myself of why I'm vanilla dating: because I'm in my 30s and need to find a life partner and because I've been single for many years and want to find a boyfriend or girlfriend. NOT to be a companion to someone because they are rich. That's what sugaring is for. It can be really tough to compartmentalize and keep the two separate. Some days, I fear that I'll never be able to fully return to vanilla dating. \ud83d\ude15",
