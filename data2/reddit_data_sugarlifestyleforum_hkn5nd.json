    "body": "... on SA!*\n\nSo we see posts multiple times a day asking why someone cant find and SD or SB. Here is a list of common reasons.\n\nFor SBs:\n\n* Not doing any research on this lifestyle/ too lazy to do it and asking for everyone to help you, without any self help first.\n\n* Ghosting and being flakey.\n\n* Location. If you are in a rural, and or economically depressed location you are going to have a harder time than say an SB in a bigger city.\n\n* Location, again. If you are in a huge city with a metric shit ton of competition it may also be harder for you to find an SD, especially given some of following reasons.\n\n* Your profile is horrible. Either it is all about you, and nothing about what you can do. OR it is blank / sparse. Or full of stuff that will turn an SD off to you, such as \"Treat me like the princess I am!\", \"I only do online platonic feet pics!\", \"I deserve to be spoiled!\" Trashing everyone else and just being negative. When in doubt as for a profile review.\n\n* Pics. Your pictures should be flattering, different from one another, show your body and at least private pics of your face. No tounge out snap chat selfie in front of dirty mirror. No drugs... seen pics with needles and spoons in them. When in doubt post here.\n\n* Lack of propper communication. I am a type of guy who can talk to most people, even about random stuff, but if I feel like I am interrogating you. And it takes a week to respond with \"NM HBU?\" I am going to next for someone I can actually talk to. We get you can be busy, but to not respond within  a day or so shows disinterest and SDs will move on to someone who is showing them interests.\n\n* Deviating from conventional standards of beauty. I may get flak for this one, but it is the truth. The heavier / fatter and more conventionally unattractive you are the harder it will be for you to find an SD. Or impossible. These are wealthy men who can pick and choose who they want. Most want thin, athletic and Jessica Rabbit curvy (not fat curvy). There isn't someone for everyone in this lifestyle. Confidence helps, but it can only take you so far in most cases. But of course you may find someone and a few SDs are in to bbw, but most aren't.\n\n* Being too rigid with some standards. Ok, you are in BFE Iowa and demanding a five figure allowance and yet wondering why you cant find an SD. I am not saying sell yourself short, but be reasonable and reasses. Or hold out for the white whale that may never come.  Also this could be used for age or whatever. Say you only want SDs under 40 but a rich and otherwise great and great looking 45 year old guy comes your way, maybe have some wiggle room. Same can be true for younger. Or whatever.\n\n* Only wanting online and blaming Corona. Other women are willing to meet in person now...\n\n* Platonic only. Why do you think a man will pay for just your company because you are cute, when he can have a blast, including intimacy with someone equally or possibly more attractive?\n\n* Escort vibes. If you are treating this purely as sex work and yet wondering why no SD sticks around, or why you are treated like an escort, well.... time to take stock and reevaluate. \n\n* Age. Many SDs prefer younger. I personally prefer in my age range, and many do like SBs in their 30s and 40s, but most prefer women in their 20s. \n\n* Rigidity on what you do behind closed doors. Ok you don't like BDSM, that's fine. But not being comfortable with certain vanilla type stuff will get you nexted most likely. Never compromise on sexual stuff and do stuff you do not want to do though.\n\n* Coming across as way too niave. You will be taken advantage of unless you luck out with a nice guy.\n\n* Falling for Scams / talking about scams in your profile. Makes you look like a mark. \n\n* Being too jaded and bitter. Negativity in the bowl is always a bad thing.\n\n* treating this like a job.\n\n* back to being out of the norm... being too alternative, being a male SB, being trans etc... you are going to have a harder time finding an SD. And this is coming from someone who has had an alternative style SGF and one later who happened to be trans. I am just a realist and take note of what others say and like. I call a spade a spade.\n\n* Not having enough time to do this (for whatever reasons), and only having short immovable windows of time. Life happens. I get it. But there are people who can meet up longer and more often.\n\n* Being desperate. Desperation turns off most SDs, and only attracts the bad ones, and maybe one or two white knight types who feel like they have to save someone... but most don't like it. It will get you taken advantage of.\n\n* Home life. If you have a BF, a Husband etc... most SDs will be turned off by this, or at least be worried by this. Some don't care, but many do.\n\n* Catfishing or Fatfishing\n\n* Talking about other SDs or other Offers\n\n* Constantly glued to your phone while with an SD\n\n* Being ultra political, especially if your politics dont align with SDs. Maybe tone it down?\n\nBut be yourselves just realize there is a lot of competition\n\n-------\n\nFor the SDs\n\n* You come out of the gate swinging promising the moon and the stars, out of lust, but cannot deliver.\n\n* You are a complete pervert immediately. At least wait until the second message guys. ;)\n\n* Making check lists and quiz type stuff for SBs you have never even said hello too. \n\n* Acting like an entitled and controlling dick\n\n* Not bathing or wiping your ass before dates and intimacy\n\n* Acting like a scammer.\n\n* Acting like a stalker.\n\n* Being too jaded\n\n* Not showing a little bit of trust\n\n* Not being honest about your marital status \n\n* Over inflating your disposable income. \n\n* Being a penny pincher\n\n* Falling in love way too quick\n\n*  Not willing to put in some sort of effort in your profile or pictures\n\n* Being creepy at times \n\n* Be able to take hints\n\n* Being unable to hold a normal conversation\n\n* Age. Below 35ish and you may have some more problems, below 28 and you will not be taken seriouslly. Above 60 and your chances also start to diminish. But there is hope.\n\n* Being ultra political. I get it, many of you / us are on the middle to right side of the political spectrum. But many if not most SBs are not. Want to turn her off completely? Talk about politics too much, especially differing ones. Tone it down until you are sure.\n\n* Being too jaded and talking trash about others.\n\n* Comparing POTs to current or former SBs frequently, and or negatively. \n\n* Degrading.\n\n* In to some freaky shit well outside the norm, like scat.\n\n*  Talking down to, or patronizing an SB because she may not be as experienced or old as you. They are adults, if you have to teach, teach by example and in a kind way.\n\n*  Being too clingy and needy, especially early in the morning. Many of us are up and fully awake and at work by or before 8am, do not expect anyone else to hold an in depth conversation by then. \n\n* Catfishing.\n\n* No follow through / flaking.\n\nThoughts?",

Avoid marriage if possible. \n\nAppearance can gain access, but personality keeps your partner.  I agree with you in terms of looks getting the first initial meet.  However, for longer terms, personality and sexual compatibility definately comes into play (aka allowance).\n\nIf you're wondering why I stayed, well,  I tried divorce once but CA divorce law is very unfriendly towards male bread winners.  My business couldn't survive it.  If I were Jeff Besos rich, I would be divorced by now... \nAs long as I don't embarrass her in front of her group of LV wearing soul suckers, she would let me be.",

I know plenty of wealthy SD in LA with average looking SB (and LA is home of the most attractive SBs around).   \n\nBeing an attractive escort will do better than a SB.  Sugaring involves a lot of nonphysical interactions.  The goal of a SB is a long term relationship ($$$).   So it is more like marriage than a one night stand.\n\nBeing attractive definately helps her get her foot in the door, but it hardly guarantees an allowance.",

There are still way more SB's looking for a legitimate generous SD that are interested in an ongoing Sugar Relationship than there are legitimate generous SD's.\n\nIf I'm seriously interested in a specific SB, I rarely have a problem getting her to meet.  I know my competition can't be that strong.  I'm fit, somewhat good looking, reasonably generous and reasonably personable, but nothing extraordinary.  You mainly just need not to be a fat, cheap, fuckwit to succeed, or at least not all three together!  lol",

Did u take a Selfie?\n\nAlso I am primarily calling bs on your bullshit list for SB's. Did your low self esteem after seeing your selfie clouded your comprehension skills? \n\nSo that this gets into your thick head let me make it simple for u -  your SB list is worthless as a 4 can do all of this and not succeed, but a 8 upwards can ignore every basic rule and can get what she wants.",

The most attractive of them was aggressively contradictory no matter the subject (it's raining out / NO IT ISN'T / ... looks out window at rain and people with umbrellas, uh, yeah it is), the second most was smooth to the point of feeling plastic, almost like you were talking to a flight attendant doing their job, and terrible breath. Third was a normal person, disagreed with me here and there, talked, chatted, had discussions involving different points of view, and in all far more likeable because they were just ... normal. \n\nSo, no it's not just pure attractiveness. As men get older they are less likely to fall into the spell of \"she's hot so acting like a spoiled 11 year old brat is ok.\" SDs have probably had some beautiful girls with them and a wide range of experiences, and once you start feeling that internal groan when she thinks her beauty entitles her to not behave like an adult the feeling of next comes up pretty strong.\n\nHormones drive this for men in their early 20s and to late 20s but after this, that shit gives you a major headache and you no longer have the patience and tolerance for it. \n\nSomeone with whom you can relax, enjoy yourself, play and have fun and who makes you feel good is critical. \n\nNote that if you take care of your body and appearance you just kind of need to meet minimum standards for beauty and it's within reach. Age too is flexible if you are fun as hell. \n\nBut if you come in and you haven't ever gone to the gym, breakfast dinner and lunch are donuts, and you project a political view that this is a real woman's body and men should get used to it, no ... that's going to fail the minimum beauty standard.\n\nI'm in the gym every day doing what I can do. I am not as good as I can be, and I'm trying to be better. For an SB I respect the same thing, I don't expect you to be perfect but pretty good is good, and if you're trying to make yourself better in ANY way (studying, reading, taking classes, going to the gym, just trying) then that bathes you in a hugely positive light.",

Far too few profiles are aimed at the largest portion of the market.  \n\nMost of these SD's are not looking for more drama in their lives and probably (especially if they are married) place a higher value on reliability ( both in her not cancelling or being very late and in her attitude during the date) .  Few SD are looking for more drama in their life.  \n\nThe best SD's want the SB to have a better life as a result of the relationship.  Not just the financial rewards but in the multitude of other ways a quality SD can help in both the short and long term.   It's one of the rewards,  especially for those SD who are not finding that in IRL . A wise SB subtly speaks to that opportunity  in her profile. \n\nYour profile needs and deserves very careful thought, organization and editing.  Both the text and the pictures should be focused on what you see as the best opportunity and be a carefully edited presentation, not something you threw together after an unhappy IRL date or a call from a creditor.",

Sure, there are others willing to meet during this time, but at what cost? I know for myself that unless someones been playing it pretty safe, there is no way I'm meeting up with them.\n\n2) Re: body type. I think it's such a personal preference that there is no hard & fast rule when it comes to this. I think it's a stereotype to say most SD's want a certain body type. I'm a size 8/10, honestly sometimes even a 12 in some brands. I've gotten a lot of attention on SA and in real life from POT SD's and I've also had quite a few successful arrangements with attractive, generous men. My body has never been an issue. Ladies if you're reading this and you're not a size 00-6, please don't let this discourage you. \n\n3) On the note of thought #2, I disagree when you say that there isn't \"someone for everyone in this lifestyle.\" I definitely think there is someone for everyone in this lifestyle, it's about finding the right person, just like any other relationship. Yes - looks are a big factor in the bowl, but aren't looks a big factor in most relationships?",

I'd think the average 20 something or younger SB won't see much difference between forties and anyone older. At that point, it's just \"old\". The difference between 45 and 65 is that the 45 yo still *thinks* he's attractive to someone who is 19, whereas the 65 yo is probably more realistic.\n\nPeople almost always go out with people around their own age. The rest are a small number of outliers. \n\nWhat that means in practical terms is that because guys think they are younger, they need to pay less, and the harder it is for a SB to convince them otherwise. As guys get older and come to terms with the reality that most women are not looking for 65 yo \"silver (or chrome dome) foxes\", it's easier to make the case they need to pay. Plus, generally, the older the richer. \n\nNote, there are obviously exceptions,  but you don't really see many romantic movies or books with big age gaps...there's a reason.",

But there is a peak to that curve. \n\nConfidence and maturity do come naturally to men as they age as they are reflections of experience. Not to say that all men do become mature and confident, but that generally it's your experience that is reflected out of you in those two things.\n\nA super hot guy also has confidence not because he looks in the mirror and knows he's hot, but because he has *experience* of almost every woman he's talked to being charmed by him so that becomes his default attitude that everything is going to go great with this new chat (i.e. confidence).\n\nThe kind of confidence you gain through age is more like, well, nothing terrible is actually going to happen from this chat. You know you can be rejected and it's not the end of the world. You know that though they are stunning they might bore you in 10 minutes so you can't put them on a super high pedestal before you even said hello. You have a lifetime of experience to tap into to judge a situation and to make conversation, and this relaxed state is perceived as well as confidence. \n\nWomen respond negatively to insecurity and positively to confidence in general. So as you age, provided you did something interesting with your life, you just become more attractive as you become more self assured and more interesting. And don't let yourself fall apart.\n\nA guy at 45 who took care of himself, is successful at business, projects confidence and experience, he is very likely close to peak male attractiveness. Think of Brad Pitt or George Clooney at 45. \n\nOptimal male and nobody would be going ewww. Fat, balding, middle manager with no sense of fashion style and no confidence ... everyone will go ew because you see that as someone who failed at the experiment that is their life. They have nothing to offer and you can easily project what the rest of their life is going to look like.",

I agree with you in terms of looks getting the first initial meet.  However, for longer terms, personality and sexual compatibility definately comes into play (aka allowance).\n\nIf you're wondering why I stayed, well,  I tried divorce once but CA divorce law is very unfriendly towards male bread winners.  My business couldn't survive it.  If I were Jeff Besos rich, I would be divorced by now... \nAs long as I don't embarrass her in front of her group of LV wearing soul suckers, she would let me be.",

I know my competition can't be that strong.  I'm fit, somewhat good looking, reasonably generous and reasonably personable, but nothing extraordinary.

Did u take a Selfie?\n\nAlso I am primarily calling bs on your bullshit list for SB's. Did your low self esteem after seeing your selfie clouded your comprehension skills? \n\nSo that this gets into your thick head let me make it simple for u -  your SB list is worthless as a 4 can do all of this and not succeed, but a 8 upwards can ignore every basic rule and can get what she wants.",

The most attractive of them was aggressively contradictory no matter the subject (it's raining out / NO IT ISN'T / ... looks out window at rain and people with umbrellas, uh, yeah it is), the second most was smooth to the point of feeling plastic, almost like you were talking to a flight attendant doing their job, and terrible breath. Third was a normal person, disagreed with me here and there, talked, chatted, had discussions involving different points of view, and in all far more likeable because they were just ... normal. \n\nSo, no it's not just pure attractiveness. As men get older they are less likely to fall into the spell of \"she's hot so acting like a spoiled 11 year old brat is ok.\" SDs have probably had some beautiful girls with them and a wide range of experiences, and once you start feeling that internal groan when she thinks her beauty entitles her to not behave like an adult the feeling of next comes up pretty strong.\n\nHormones drive this for men in their early 20s and to late 20s but after this, that shit gives you a major headache and you no longer have the patience and tolerance for it. \n\nSomeone with whom you can relax, enjoy yourself, play and have fun and who makes you feel good is critical. \n\nNote that if you take care of your body and appearance you just kind of need to meet minimum standards for beauty and it's within reach. Age too is flexible if you are fun as hell. \n\nBut if you come in and you haven't ever gone to the gym, breakfast dinner and lunch are donuts, and you project a political view that this is a real woman's body and men should get used to it, no ... that's going to fail the minimum beauty standard.\n\nI'm in the gym every day doing what I can do. I am not as good as I can be, and I'm trying to be better. For an SB I respect the same thing, I don't expect you to be perfect but pretty good is good, and if you're trying to make yourself better in ANY way (studying, reading, taking classes, going to the gym, just trying) then that bathes you in a hugely positive light.",

Most SD's are older, probably more conservative and not the flash-daddys so promoted by SA.  Far too few profiles are aimed at the largest portion of the market.  \n\nMost of these SD's are not looking for more drama in their lives and probably (especially if they are married) place a higher value on reliability ( both in her not cancelling or being very late and in her attitude during the date) .  Few SD are looking for more drama in their life.  \n\nThe best SD's want the SB to have a better life as a result of the relationship.  Not just the financial rewards but in the multitude of other ways a quality SD can help in both the short and long term.   It's one of the rewards,  especially for those SD who are not finding that in IRL . A wise SB subtly speaks to that opportunity  in her profile. \n\nYour profile needs and deserves very careful thought, organization and editing.  Both the text and the pictures should be focused on what you see as the best opportunity and be a carefully edited presentation, not something you threw together after an unhappy IRL date or a call from a creditor.",

Not to say that all men do become mature and confident, but that generally it's your experience that is reflected out of you in those two things.\n\nA super hot guy also has confidence not because he looks in the mirror and knows he's hot, but because he has *experience* of almost every woman he's talked to being charmed by him so that becomes his default attitude that everything is going to go great with this new chat (i.e. confidence).\n\nThe kind of confidence you gain through age is more like, well, nothing terrible is actually going to happen from this chat. You know you can be rejected and it's not the end of the world. You know that though they are stunning they might bore you in 10 minutes so you can't put them on a super high pedestal before you even said hello. You have a lifetime of experience to tap into to judge a situation and to make conversation, and this relaxed state is perceived as well as confidence. \n\nWomen respond negatively to insecurity and positively to confidence in general. So as you age, provided you did something interesting with your life, you just become more attractive as you become more self assured and more interesting. And don't let yourself fall apart.\n\nA guy at 45 who took care of himself, is successful at business, projects confidence and experience, he is very likely close to peak male attractiveness. Think of Brad Pitt or George Clooney at 45. \n\nOptimal male and nobody would be going ewww. Fat, balding, middle manager with no sense of fashion style and no confidence ... everyone will go ew because you see that as someone who failed at the experiment that is their life. They have nothing to offer and you can easily project what the rest of their life is going to look like.",

The most attractive of them was aggressively contradictory no matter the subject (it's raining out / NO IT ISN'T / ... looks out window at rain and people with umbrellas, uh, yeah it is), the second most was smooth to the point of feeling plastic, almost like you were talking to a flight attendant doing their job, and terrible breath. Third was a normal person, disagreed with me here and there, talked, chatted, had discussions involving different points of view, and in all far more likeable because they were just ... normal. \n\nSo, no it's not just pure attractiveness. As men get older they are less likely to fall into the spell of \"she's hot so acting like a spoiled 11 year old brat is ok.\" SDs have probably had some beautiful girls with them and a wide range of experiences, and once you start feeling that internal groan when she thinks her beauty entitles her to not behave like an adult the feeling of next comes up pretty strong.\n\nHormones drive this for men in their early 20s and to late 20s but after this, that shit gives you a major headache and you no longer have the patience and tolerance for it. \n\nSomeone with whom you can relax, enjoy yourself, play and have fun and who makes you feel good is critical. \n\nNote that if you take care of your body and appearance you just kind of need to meet minimum standards for beauty and it's within reach. Age too is flexible if you are fun as hell. \n\nBut if you come in and you haven't ever gone to the gym, breakfast dinner and lunch are donuts, and you project a political view that this is a real woman's body and men should get used to it, no ... that's going to fail the minimum beauty standard.\n\nI'm in the gym every day doing what I can do. I am not as good as I can be, and I'm trying to be better. For an SB I respect the same thing, I don't expect you to be perfect but pretty good is good, and if you're trying to make yourself better in ANY way (studying, reading, taking classes, going to the gym, just trying) then that bathes you in a hugely positive light.",

Most SD's are older, probably more conservative and not the flash-daddys so promoted by SA.  Far too few profiles are aimed at the largest portion of the market.  \n\nMost of these SD's are not looking for more drama in their lives and probably (especially if they are married) place a higher value on reliability ( both in her not cancelling or being very late and in her attitude during the date) .  Few SD are looking for more drama in their life.  \n\nThe best SD's want the SB to have a better life as a result of the relationship.  Not just the financial rewards but in the multitude of other ways a quality SD can help in both the short and long term.   It's one of the rewards,  especially for those SD who are not finding that in IRL . A wise SB subtly speaks to that opportunity  in her profile. \n\nYour profile needs and deserves very careful thought, organization and editing.  Both the text and the pictures should be focused on what you see as the best opportunity and be a carefully edited presentation, not something you threw together after an unhappy IRL date or a call from a creditor.",

I agree with you in terms of looks getting the first initial meet.  However, for longer terms, personality and sexual compatibility definately comes into play (aka allowance).\n\nIf you're wondering why I stayed, well,  I tried divorce once but CA divorce law is very unfriendly towards male bread winners.  My business couldn't survive it.  If I were Jeff Besos rich, I would be divorced by now... \nAs long as I don't embarrass her in front of her group of LV wearing soul suckers, she would let me be.",

I know plenty of wealthy SD in LA with average looking SB (and LA is home of the most attractive SBs around).   \n\nBeing an attractive escort will do better than a SB.  Sugaring involves a lot of nonphysical interactions.  The goal of a SB is a long term relationship ($$$).   So it is more like marriage than a one night stand.\n\nBeing attractive definately helps her get her foot in the door, but it hardly guarantees an allowance.",

Did u take a Selfie?\n\nAlso I am primarily calling bs on your bullshit list for SB's. Did your low self esteem after seeing your selfie clouded your comprehension skills? \n\nSo that this gets into your thick head let me make it simple for u -  your SB list is worthless as a 4 can do all of this and not succeed, but a 8 upwards can ignore every basic rule and can get what she wants.",

Why do you think attractive women are the most insecure ones?  \n\nJust be attractive and it will land you an SD is an oversimplification imo.  I know plenty of wealthy SD in LA with average looking SB (and LA is home of the most attractive SBs around).   \n\nBeing an attractive escort will do better than a SB.  Sugaring involves a lot of nonphysical interactions.  The goal of a SB is a long term relationship ($$$).   So it is more like marriage than a one night stand.\n\nBeing attractive definately helps her get her foot in the door, but it hardly guarantees an allowance.",
