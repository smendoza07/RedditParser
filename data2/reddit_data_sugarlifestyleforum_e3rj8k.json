    "body": "Please learn from my idiotic, painful mistake. \n\nI met a POT  SD on SA who seemed to check all my boxes. Handsome, suave, and wanted to meet in person. \n\nI asked him if he had any experience in the bowl, and he sent me to a very popular YouTube video from 2012 of a TV interview with him about being a sugar daddy. I found it funny because I remembered watching it years ago. It was the whole nine yards: $$$$ allowances, multiple beachfront homes, designer everything. He seemed genuine, intelligent, the real deal. As a business owner, I was intrigued by his story as well.\n\nHis phone number checked out, so we arranged to meet in person and get sushi. We met at his place where I fell in love with his dog. Seriously, the cutest dog. I let my guard down. Next thing I know he\u2019s cooking me dinner and being charming as hell. I\u2019m dancing with him overlooking the ocean. \n\nBefore I know it, I\u2019m bent over his bed while he whips me with a belt then pees on me without my consent. This is 100% new and I continue to ask him to stop. I tell him I\u2019m uncomfortable and try to remove myself from the situation. \n\nHe gets upset, then drunk and high. I leave with no allowance while he falls all over the place. \n\nA few days later, he texts me that he won\u2019t see me again and that I was \u201cseductive,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t want to pursue anything further because I do not want to be recorded. \n\nAlthough I\u2019m sure we all have stories of being used (I have plenty), this one stung on another level because I know how likely it is that he has done this many, many times. \n\nConsidering taking a long break from the bowl.",

Clearly a violation of her consent  and assault.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s very different than the police even trying to charge someone (and succeeding in a conviction)\n\n>That is not consensual.

The burden of proof for criminality is far higher and far more invasive on the victim. \n\nOn top of that, you can be violently raped and the cops sometimes don\u2019t bother to test the rape kits or pursue the rapist. It\u2019s not that assault victims shouldn\u2019t file complaints against their attackers, it\u2019s that the system seems so broken it often doesn\u2019t work, even in the most extreme cases. So why not pursue the perpetrator in a way that\u2019s going to be faster, less invasive, and possibly more successful.\n\nFinally, consent can be offered and then taken back at any time. This is why \u2018at first\u2019 matters here. The sequence of events matters a lot, even more so in a criminal investigation. Are these not the same details cops are going to ask for?",

It's typical that shits like this will blame the other person (i.e. \"...he won\u2019t see me again and that I was \u201cseductive,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t want to pursue anything further because I do not want to be recorded.\") And it's also fairly typical that shits like this with money think they're above the law and won't be pursued.\n\nTwo things: 1) Him doing that was NOT your fault; 2) You did nothing wrong. You made it clear what he was doing was NOT welcome or wanted, and he continued. That is assault. Plain and simple. Whether you choose to make him face legal consequences or not is your choice.\n\nI also agree on your taking a break for a while. Assault causes trauma, which will take time to heal from and you owe that to yourself. \n\nIn future - and this is for ALL SBs - don't be blinded if a potential SD shows off money and material goods. In my experience, genuine SDs (and good people in general) have no need to do this. I also agree never meeting a POT SD at his home the first time. Occasionally it turns out well ... but all too often it doesn't.",

Like I previously said, I\u2019m not experienced, not a good pretender, and my SD might not even be what you consider a real SD.  There\u2019s no PPM or allowance, if I need help I ask him.

Where does anything I wrote say any of this? \n\nMy other exact words were:\n\n\u201cDo what you think is best...\u201d, \u201cfile a civil suit\u201d and \u201cconsensual at first\u201d \n\nFiling a civil suit is easier to win and is likely to be more damaging to him (financially). The burden of proof for criminality is far higher and far more invasive on the victim. \n\nOn top of that, you can be violently raped and the cops sometimes don\u2019t bother to test the rape kits or pursue the rapist. It\u2019s not that assault victims shouldn\u2019t file complaints against their attackers, it\u2019s that the system seems so broken it often doesn\u2019t work, even in the most extreme cases. So why not pursue the perpetrator in a way that\u2019s going to be faster, less invasive, and possibly more successful.\n\nFinally, consent can be offered and then taken back at any time. This is why \u2018at first\u2019 matters here. The sequence of events matters a lot, even more so in a criminal investigation. Are these not the same details cops are going to ask for?",

It\u2019s not that assault victims shouldn\u2019t file complaints against their attackers, it\u2019s that the system seems so broken it often doesn\u2019t work, even in the most extreme cases. So why not pursue the perpetrator in a way that\u2019s going to be faster, less invasive, and possibly more successful.\n\nFinally, consent can be offered and then taken back at any time. This is why \u2018at first\u2019 matters here. The sequence of events matters a lot, even more so in a criminal investigation. Are these not the same details cops are going to ask for?",

The burden of proof for criminality is far higher and far more invasive on the victim. \n\nOn top of that, you can be violently raped and the cops sometimes don\u2019t bother to test the rape kits or pursue the rapist. It\u2019s not that assault victims shouldn\u2019t file complaints against their attackers, it\u2019s that the system seems so broken it often doesn\u2019t work, even in the most extreme cases. So why not pursue the perpetrator in a way that\u2019s going to be faster, less invasive, and possibly more successful.\n\nFinally, consent can be offered and then taken back at any time. This is why \u2018at first\u2019 matters here. The sequence of events matters a lot, even more so in a criminal investigation. Are these not the same details cops are going to ask for?",

The burden of proof for criminality is far higher and far more invasive on the victim. \n\nOn top of that, you can be violently raped and the cops sometimes don\u2019t bother to test the rape kits or pursue the rapist. It\u2019s not that assault victims shouldn\u2019t file complaints against their attackers, it\u2019s that the system seems so broken it often doesn\u2019t work, even in the most extreme cases. So why not pursue the perpetrator in a way that\u2019s going to be faster, less invasive, and possibly more successful.\n\nFinally, consent can be offered and then taken back at any time. This is why \u2018at first\u2019 matters here. The sequence of events matters a lot, even more so in a criminal investigation. Are these not the same details cops are going to ask for?",

Where does anything I wrote say any of this? \n\nMy other exact words were:\n\n\u201cDo what you think is best...\u201d, \u201cfile a civil suit\u201d and \u201cconsensual at first\u201d \n\nFiling a civil suit is easier to win and is likely to be more damaging to him (financially). The burden of proof for criminality is far higher and far more invasive on the victim. \n\nOn top of that, you can be violently raped and the cops sometimes don\u2019t bother to test the rape kits or pursue the rapist. It\u2019s not that assault victims shouldn\u2019t file complaints against their attackers, it\u2019s that the system seems so broken it often doesn\u2019t work, even in the most extreme cases. So why not pursue the perpetrator in a way that\u2019s going to be faster, less invasive, and possibly more successful.\n\nFinally, consent can be offered and then taken back at any time. This is why \u2018at first\u2019 matters here. The sequence of events matters a lot, even more so in a criminal investigation. Are these not the same details cops are going to ask for?",
