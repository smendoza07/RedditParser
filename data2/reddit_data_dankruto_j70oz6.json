This is mainly evident during the Five Kage Summit Arc, when she is told by Kakashi to leave. She thought it was all up to her to be the one that had to stop Sasuke, (Even when storywise, no other character thought she was important)",

This is mainly evident during the Five Kage Summit Arc, when she is told by Kakashi to leave. She thought it was all up to her to be the one that had to stop Sasuke, (Even when storywise, no other character thought she was important)",

This is mainly evident during the Five Kage Summit Arc, when she is told by Kakashi to leave. She thought it was all up to her to be the one that had to stop Sasuke, (Even when storywise, no other character thought she was important)",

This is mainly evident during the Five Kage Summit Arc, when she is told by Kakashi to leave. She thought it was all up to her to be the one that had to stop Sasuke, (Even when storywise, no other character thought she was important)",
