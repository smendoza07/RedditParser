I just had her move my fade on the longer side to match the messed up side and blend the top accordingly.  If you do that you can just keep the middle and spike it.  Google high and tight haircut.  You will find something that looks enough like the bad side to have someone change it to that cut.  In the end its just hair and will grow back.",
