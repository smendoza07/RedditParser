    "body": "Can we get this u/Hair2Bald guy removed from this subreddit please? He's being a massive dick to guys who are concerned about potential hairloss. He's not providing any actual useful advice. All he does is tell people they are balding and must shave it all off regardless of how much hair loss is actually occuring. Often times its to kids who have full heads of hair and are just feeling a bit concerned about future hair loss. I feel like his intent is not to provide actual advice but either make the entire world bald or make a bunch of young guys feel crap about themselves.",

For some reason most of the people advocate for bald heads when the subreddit is called male HAIR advice. I think people in general need to stop telling everyone to go bald unless it\u2019s absolutely clear that you should. There are so many other hairstyles that can help with receding hairlines, and many different treatments and/or courses of action.",

DO IT NOW!\"\n\nHowever, when someone ask a question like, \"what should I do?\" or \"what would work better for me?\"   He actually gives advice, although I will concede he does have a bias towards very short hair.\n\nI can see his point, this is /r/malehairadvice, not /r/tressless or something like that, which honestly would be more appropriate.\n\nThe problem isnt the advice he gives,  its the fact that he has no fucks to give when it comes to reassuring someone about their hairline.  \n\nWhile nobody is going to accuse him of being a caring, nurturing, supportive type to men panicking over their impending shiny, bald head, I think breaking out the pitchforks and torches is really uncalled for and totally inappropriate. \n\nAfter all, while rule #1 says, \"dont be a dick\" it would be pointless to argue if he is vioalting it when his slash and burn advice is directed at who are not posting a topic which is on topic to this subforum-- \n\n>We are a sub focused on discussing men's hair styling and giving advice to those looking to change their hairstyle\n\nThey arent looking for style advice, theyre asking someone to look into the crystal ball like portions of their barren scalp and predict the future.    So isnt it more a moderation issue, not keeping post on topic, more than someone giving, \"bad\" advice?",
