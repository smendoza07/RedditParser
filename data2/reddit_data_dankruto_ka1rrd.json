Iruka is the first person who saw that Naruto had potential.\n\nUnlike the third Hokage who was such a shitty parental figure to Naruto. He didn't even fulfill Minato & Kushina's wishes, but rather let Naruto grow up like a wild kid. Not even doing anything to help the way others marginalized him.",

Hiruzen was also a fuckin Kage, he had other shit to worry than watching 1 child run around every day, which is why he appointed Anbu to look after him. Also, in war arc, Naruto says he looked up to Hiruzen, and he was the main reason Naruto wanted to be Hokage. Naruto needed to have a shitty childhood in order for the plot to work that let him connect to every Jinchuuriki and villain about being mistreated. And the wish from Kushina to Hiruzen seems like such a big plot hole that ruined Hiruzen, cuz after Naruto's shitty childhood is shown and the Hokage not doing much, all of a sudden we get a scene of the Hokage being told to watch after the protagonist. Also, where was Jiraiya, Naruto's godfather?",

People constantly saying he let Itachi kill his clan. No Danzo pretty much gave Itachi an ultimatum essentially threatening Itachi with Sasuke\u2019s fate. Hiruzen didn\u2019t know about the plan to massacre the Uchiha until after it happened and Itachi explained to Hiruzen about Danzo\u2019s plan. Hiruzen then had Danzo\u2019s position removed and Root dissolved. Made a story to cover up the Uchiha\u2019s plan to revolt so no one would go after Sasuke. He did is best to stop Orochimaru when the sand village attacked, harming him enough to stop him at the cost of his life. On top of all this, this happened when it was Hiruzen\u2019s second time being hokage, dude was probably tired and wanted to retire and smoke his pipe in peace. He did what was expected of the Hokage.",

To conceptualize this, imagine a vertical spectrum.\n\nI consider the high level strategists (Shikamaru, Kakashi, Itachi) to be at the top of the spectrum in regards to tactics and IQ. This gives them an advantage over less \"intellectual\" opponents.\n\nPerpendicular to this vertical spectrum is another we'll call \"Skill,\" which is a condensation of Combat prowess, physique, tool-use, and other controllable, \"trainable\" factors.\n\nThis creates a coordinate plane with which we can categorize Nin. \n\nThe wildcard factor is Jutsu, Kekkei Genki, and Chakra which we will hereafter refer to as \"Talent\".\nAdding the final z to our imaginary spectrum, we finally realise the true space between different opponents. \n\nFor example. Shikamaru and Kakashi. I may be bold to say this but in regards to their IQ and Skill, I'd consider them near equal, which Kakashi having a marginally edge due to his expirence. But when you account talent, the gap between them becomes apparent.\n\nShikamaru's ace card Jutsu is Shadow Possession. It's versatile, definitely a A/B class jutsu in Shikamaru's hands. \n\nKakashi (currently) has Shiden which is an S class Jutsu, and while not as versatile, is devatsstingly effective. Also, he his one of the few Rasengan practitioners.\n\nThis would theoretically, and with high probability give Kakashi a win in a fair fight. This is completely disregarding that Kakashi took a big nerf losing the Sharingan and access to another handful of Jutsu he had that was tactically reliant on him using them in tandem with Sharingan.\n\nNow replace Kakashi with Madara. \n\nIQ wise, I'd say Shikamaru is tactically smarter. However this advantage would do little to help him. Madara, in base form, is an elite Kage level nin. If we were to place him on our 3D spectrum he would be near the extreme apex of all the factors. \n\nThis is disregarding the infinite chakra from his edo tensei for and all the other powers he recieves during the Fourth Great Ninja War.\n\nTl;dr\n\nYes, he is \"smarter\" than Madara but not by an amount that would allow him to overcome the difference between their \"Skill\" and \"Talent\" (see main post for explanation.) Conclusion: Madara will still win 10 times out of 10 against Shikamaru.",

Hiruzen was also a fuckin Kage, he had other shit to worry than watching 1 child run around every day, which is why he appointed Anbu to look after him. Also, in war arc, Naruto says he looked up to Hiruzen, and he was the main reason Naruto wanted to be Hokage. Naruto needed to have a shitty childhood in order for the plot to work that let him connect to every Jinchuuriki and villain about being mistreated. And the wish from Kushina to Hiruzen seems like such a big plot hole that ruined Hiruzen, cuz after Naruto's shitty childhood is shown and the Hokage not doing much, all of a sudden we get a scene of the Hokage being told to watch after the protagonist. Also, where was Jiraiya, Naruto's godfather?",

People constantly saying he let Itachi kill his clan. No Danzo pretty much gave Itachi an ultimatum essentially threatening Itachi with Sasuke\u2019s fate. Hiruzen didn\u2019t know about the plan to massacre the Uchiha until after it happened and Itachi explained to Hiruzen about Danzo\u2019s plan. Hiruzen then had Danzo\u2019s position removed and Root dissolved. Made a story to cover up the Uchiha\u2019s plan to revolt so no one would go after Sasuke. He did is best to stop Orochimaru when the sand village attacked, harming him enough to stop him at the cost of his life. On top of all this, this happened when it was Hiruzen\u2019s second time being hokage, dude was probably tired and wanted to retire and smoke his pipe in peace. He did what was expected of the Hokage.",

To conceptualize this, imagine a vertical spectrum.\n\nI consider the high level strategists (Shikamaru, Kakashi, Itachi) to be at the top of the spectrum in regards to tactics and IQ. This gives them an advantage over less \"intellectual\" opponents.\n\nPerpendicular to this vertical spectrum is another we'll call \"Skill,\" which is a condensation of Combat prowess, physique, tool-use, and other controllable, \"trainable\" factors.\n\nThis creates a coordinate plane with which we can categorize Nin. \n\nThe wildcard factor is Jutsu, Kekkei Genki, and Chakra which we will hereafter refer to as \"Talent\".\nAdding the final z to our imaginary spectrum, we finally realise the true space between different opponents. \n\nFor example. Shikamaru and Kakashi. I may be bold to say this but in regards to their IQ and Skill, I'd consider them near equal, which Kakashi having a marginally edge due to his expirence. But when you account talent, the gap between them becomes apparent.\n\nShikamaru's ace card Jutsu is Shadow Possession. It's versatile, definitely a A/B class jutsu in Shikamaru's hands. \n\nKakashi (currently) has Shiden which is an S class Jutsu, and while not as versatile, is devatsstingly effective. Also, he his one of the few Rasengan practitioners.\n\nThis would theoretically, and with high probability give Kakashi a win in a fair fight. This is completely disregarding that Kakashi took a big nerf losing the Sharingan and access to another handful of Jutsu he had that was tactically reliant on him using them in tandem with Sharingan.\n\nNow replace Kakashi with Madara. \n\nIQ wise, I'd say Shikamaru is tactically smarter. However this advantage would do little to help him. Madara, in base form, is an elite Kage level nin. If we were to place him on our 3D spectrum he would be near the extreme apex of all the factors. \n\nThis is disregarding the infinite chakra from his edo tensei for and all the other powers he recieves during the Fourth Great Ninja War.\n\nTl;dr\n\nYes, he is \"smarter\" than Madara but not by an amount that would allow him to overcome the difference between their \"Skill\" and \"Talent\" (see main post for explanation.) Conclusion: Madara will still win 10 times out of 10 against Shikamaru.",

He didn't even fulfill Minato & Kushina's wishes, but rather let Naruto grow up like a wild kid. Not even doing anything to help the way others marginalized him.",

Hiruzen was also a fuckin Kage, he had other shit to worry than watching 1 child run around every day, which is why he appointed Anbu to look after him. Also, in war arc, Naruto says he looked up to Hiruzen, and he was the main reason Naruto wanted to be Hokage. Naruto needed to have a shitty childhood in order for the plot to work that let him connect to every Jinchuuriki and villain about being mistreated. And the wish from Kushina to Hiruzen seems like such a big plot hole that ruined Hiruzen, cuz after Naruto's shitty childhood is shown and the Hokage not doing much, all of a sudden we get a scene of the Hokage being told to watch after the protagonist. Also, where was Jiraiya, Naruto's godfather?",

Hiruzen didn\u2019t know about the plan to massacre the Uchiha until after it happened and Itachi explained to Hiruzen about Danzo\u2019s plan. Hiruzen then had Danzo\u2019s position removed and Root dissolved. Made a story to cover up the Uchiha\u2019s plan to revolt so no one would go after Sasuke. He did is best to stop Orochimaru when the sand village attacked, harming him enough to stop him at the cost of his life. On top of all this, this happened when it was Hiruzen\u2019s second time being hokage, dude was probably tired and wanted to retire and smoke his pipe in peace. He did what was expected of the Hokage.",

Hiruzen was also a fuckin Kage, he had other shit to worry than watching 1 child run around every day, which is why he appointed Anbu to look after him. Also, in war arc, Naruto says he looked up to Hiruzen, and he was the main reason Naruto wanted to be Hokage. Naruto needed to have a shitty childhood in order for the plot to work that let him connect to every Jinchuuriki and villain about being mistreated. And the wish from Kushina to Hiruzen seems like such a big plot hole that ruined Hiruzen, cuz after Naruto's shitty childhood is shown and the Hokage not doing much, all of a sudden we get a scene of the Hokage being told to watch after the protagonist. Also, where was Jiraiya, Naruto's godfather?",

No Danzo pretty much gave Itachi an ultimatum essentially threatening Itachi with Sasuke\u2019s fate. Hiruzen didn\u2019t know about the plan to massacre the Uchiha until after it happened and Itachi explained to Hiruzen about Danzo\u2019s plan. Hiruzen then had Danzo\u2019s position removed and Root dissolved. Made a story to cover up the Uchiha\u2019s plan to revolt so no one would go after Sasuke. He did is best to stop Orochimaru when the sand village attacked, harming him enough to stop him at the cost of his life. On top of all this, this happened when it was Hiruzen\u2019s second time being hokage, dude was probably tired and wanted to retire and smoke his pipe in peace. He did what was expected of the Hokage.",

Hiruzen didn\u2019t know about the plan to massacre the Uchiha until after it happened and Itachi explained to Hiruzen about Danzo\u2019s plan. Hiruzen then had Danzo\u2019s position removed and Root dissolved. Made a story to cover up the Uchiha\u2019s plan to revolt so no one would go after Sasuke. He did is best to stop Orochimaru when the sand village attacked, harming him enough to stop him at the cost of his life. On top of all this, this happened when it was Hiruzen\u2019s second time being hokage, dude was probably tired and wanted to retire and smoke his pipe in peace. He did what was expected of the Hokage.",

Shikamaru and others just had to make sure Naruto reaches Sasuke which they succeeded but then Sasuke didn't listen to Naruto and after that Naruto lost to him which turned the mission into a failure. I agree that Shikamaru would have lost to that sound Ninja if Temari wouldn't have interfered. He was doing great in the fight but the edge was with the girl near the end there.",
