Kakashi got so much stronger as the series progressed, even without training, that the idea of Zabuza as a challenge for Kakashi stopped being reasonable pretty quickly in Shippuden. \n\nIt doesn't help that we later learn Kakashi had a mangekyo sharingan available the whole time. Kamui would have ended the fight with Zabuza immediately, especially as Zabuza was a sitting duck while using the water prison jutsu. Once the existence of kamui is revealed to the audience, the story becomes \"Kakashi could have ended the fight at any time, but he wasn't sure it was worth heavy exhaustion and a slight degredation to his sharingan's eyesight.\"\n\nAlso the later introduction of the rest of the 7 Swords of the Mist didn't help Zabuza much. Of the seven, the Executioner Blade is the least impressive (still looks cool though) for combat. And its gimmick, using iron in blood to repair itself, means it's one of the very few swords we see repeatedly broken in Naruto. Based on how often the blade breaks, it comes across like the Executioner Blade is unusually fragile and therefore needs that repair feature.",

Probably not to the extent that Kakashi does as he becomes Uber powerful. But, possibly with help from Haku they can be on par with an Akatsuki duo. His sword is pretty lame too. It would be cool if the sword also increases in size/strength when it steals iron from enemies' blood. \n\nIn short, Zabuza is a cool character and I wish he got some more screentime.

Even though Kakashi gets Mangekyou Sharingan when he's younger, he passes out, and has no idea he has it until much later. We probably won't see how he finds out about it any time soon, he most probably read the Uchiha tablet to see if he can improve his Sharingan.",

Kakashi got so much stronger as the series progressed, even without training, that the idea of Zabuza as a challenge for Kakashi stopped being reasonable pretty quickly in Shippuden. \n\nIt doesn't help that we later learn Kakashi had a mangekyo sharingan available the whole time. Kamui would have ended the fight with Zabuza immediately, especially as Zabuza was a sitting duck while using the water prison jutsu. Once the existence of kamui is revealed to the audience, the story becomes \"Kakashi could have ended the fight at any time, but he wasn't sure it was worth heavy exhaustion and a slight degredation to his sharingan's eyesight.\"\n\nAlso the later introduction of the rest of the 7 Swords of the Mist didn't help Zabuza much. Of the seven, the Executioner Blade is the least impressive (still looks cool though) for combat. And its gimmick, using iron in blood to repair itself, means it's one of the very few swords we see repeatedly broken in Naruto. Based on how often the blade breaks, it comes across like the Executioner Blade is unusually fragile and therefore needs that repair feature.",

Probably not to the extent that Kakashi does as he becomes Uber powerful. But, possibly with help from Haku they can be on par with an Akatsuki duo. His sword is pretty lame too. It would be cool if the sword also increases in size/strength when it steals iron from enemies' blood. \n\nIn short, Zabuza is a cool character and I wish he got some more screentime. Seeing him resurrected was a mistake as I feel his story was resolved on the bridge when he died.",

Even though Kakashi gets Mangekyou Sharingan when he's younger, he passes out, and has no idea he has it until much later. We probably won't see how he finds out about it any time soon, he most probably read the Uchiha tablet to see if he can improve his Sharingan.",

It would be cool if the sword also increases in size/strength when it steals iron from enemies' blood. \n\nIn short, Zabuza is a cool character and I wish he got some more screentime. Seeing him resurrected was a mistake as I feel his story was resolved on the bridge when he died.",

Even though Kakashi gets Mangekyou Sharingan when he's younger, he passes out, and has no idea he has it until much later. We probably won't see how he finds out about it any time soon, he most probably read the Uchiha tablet to see if he can improve his Sharingan.",
