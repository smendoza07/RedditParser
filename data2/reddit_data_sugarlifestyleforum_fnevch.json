    "body": "So lately I've been hit for monetary aid from my latest SB and a couple other ones I've seen last year. I'm sure most SDs are getting these too in these difficult times.\n\nWhat I don't get is why SBs expect any kind of help when their mantra has always been money before honey.\n\nAnd you can see the shaming in this very sub about \"real men\" helping their SBs while not getting any and somehow men that don't that are \"trash\".\n\nSugaring is a MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL deal, and right now many SBs are asking for charity.\n\nAnd I'm sorry but I can think of a million better cause for charity right now. Like for example, helping coordinate transportation for health care workers in my developing country.\n\nTLDR: You didn't give us anything for free when times were good so why do you expect free money when times are bad?\n\nEdit: can someone please explain why are comments blocked?",

Yes, a monetary allowance should be in place, but i think a lot of relationships evolve beyond that. At least thst's what I want for my relationships.\n\n\nNo, you don't have to give to this charity. And if your relationships have been strictly transactional, then yes, I think you have the right to be offended when she asks. But I don't think every relationship works that way. \n\nSome people in this sub act and talk like their SB/SD is their enemy. And that sucks :(",

There is plenty of tumblr/twitter/SLF literature from the SB side that will prove that his thoughts have merit. Yup no money / no honey etc etc etc. If one went by those blogs then no SB is getting any help period the end. But we all know that\u2019s not the case. There are many relationships that transcend the standard transactional format! We know that.\n\nPersonally this is a time for everyone who can help to step up and help. I have given help to a few SBs from my past life. I have not given them help for sexual favors but I have given them help because I saw them as good strong hardworking people who are now facing a crisis for no fault of them. \nDid it occur to me that they may have other SDs who might also be helping, yes but I could care less. I ended up helping anyway.",

You start frequenting the bar. You pay for your drinks, the bartender makes you your drink, you relax and enjoy your drink. You become somewhat of a regular. \n\nOne day you see the bartender at a coffee shop. He looks a little depress. He tells you he's lost his job because the bar closed. He can't find another job and is really hungry. He asks if you can buy him a donut...\n\n* you say no, because you've always hated him and think he's a jerk\n* you say no, because you too have lost your lost and can't afford to spend money on others\n* you say no, because you don't want to get involve in other people's issues\n* you say yes, because you like the guy and he's always made you good drinks\n* you say yes, because you are just a nice guy and buying him a donut is within your means\n\nSo it's completely up to you to buy the guy a donut or not. No one will judge you if you say yes or no. BUT it has NOTHING to do with whether the bartender gave you free drinks before. It has nothing to do with the transactional nature of buying a drink. You two are human beings who have interacted with one another. \n\n\"Well, you never gave me free drinks before, why should I help you\" What kind of F-up thinking is this? Did the bartender hurt you? Spit in your drink? Yes, you had to pay for your drinks at the bar. You also enjoyed your drinks. And now, when times are tough, you are using some twisted BS logic to belittle the bartender?\n\nGod help us with people like you. Seriously, reflect on why you feel this way. If you are unable to help, don't. If you don't like the SB, ignore her. But this me vs her, this \"what have you done for me\", this \"I never got it for free\" mentality is just unhealthy.",

It starts with the \u201cmoney for honey,\u201d there is no question, but where does it go from there? If that is all you are looking for then that is all you will get. I was with one woman for almost three years and I certainly have deep and abiding feelings for her. Yes, like any relationship that ends, the sex ended too. But, if she became needy, I would do what I can to help. She is a hard working nursing student who works and goes to school. She is strong, independent, and capable and that is part of why I care for her. \u201cAnd in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\u201d",

I thought I was pretty clear before but I guess I will explain it more slowly....?\n\nFirst of all, of course I wouldn\u2019t stop seeing my SD if he lost his job. This is a result of many reasons, but one of those reasons that is pertinent to this conversation is that my SD has a rather large amount of investments and money set aside\u2014he doesn\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck. He would be able to find another job fairly easily. If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

We were seeing each other 2x a week, sometimes more, and talked constantly. \n\nThere was a future on the other side of that paused allowance, and we both knew it.

Most only care about their struggles; just like when you were doing well, you choose to spend your money on sugar.  They are struggling as well and want charity and even to see you.  You are exactly right that it should be helping those suffering, but it takes someone in the public sector (health care) to understand.  \n\nI'm a nursing student and we are stiffed and stuck with this Corvid-19.  We can't help, we can't go to school,and we want to help, hospitals won't let us in because we aren't insured by them and use PPE that they need and short on.  Find a nursing student and you may see change in time of distress and sympathy. My previous SD's always felt comfortable with me lol, they get free physical exams and Basic Life Saving Support in case they have an emergency.",

This means there isnt trust, or genuine care about my well being. \n\nThe reason behind women wanting these arrangements is for the security and stability older men with finances offer. Unfortunately because of how the sexes have been predispositioned,  historically and genetically speaking, the one with the penis has to prove himself first.\nThis goes with vanilla dating too, and as you have already experienced, in arrangements as well with fiances.\nThese are \"unpresedented times!\" Lol. So in this situation I'm going to assume you need to show you have your SB's back, unless you dont have enough funds to be able to make such investment in her , to trust she will return the honey when possible. ?",

No jewelry none of the expensive things that were purchased. But guess what she has constantly called and tried to black mail me and use me for money in any way she can.   \nMy point here is 99% of the bowl is her for pretty and shiny objects. They don\u2019t care about the sd or his situation just like fuck boys and sugar mommas. Me I help out one right now but let me tell you this and she knows it to when this is over. You can\u2019t bring something to the table from here on then they can keep stepping. One thing I have learned since my marriage ended is that young women still find me attractive and want me at 48 and don\u2019t expect money and most are actually mire intelligent and better off financially than any one I met in Sa or any ppm sites out there.",

Sugaring and prostitution would differ here where prostitution is mainly about transactional sex, whereas sugaring is more about maintaining relationship styled interactions that aren't completely based on sex. So it comes down to the relationship. The PPM is not really sugaring then? If a sugar baby starts charging you more to have sex twice, that's not a true sugaring relationship and then not paying them during a crisis would be relevant. However, if you have a mini relationship, that changes everything. I think that makes sense to me. What would be some examples of differentiating sugaring and prostitution?",

Well, that depends on what \"honey\" is. Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

My then SB stayed with me, even though I wasn\u2019t able to pay her allowance that month due to liquidity issues). She was made whole and then some in the end, but although I would have understood if she\u2019d withheld her company during that stressful period, it would have been the death knell of the relationship. \n\nI\u2019d say that if you a loyal and supportive SB that you trust, keep the money flowing, even if you\u2019re not getting laid. She\u2019ll make it up to you when this over. If you don\u2019t have a SB like that, maybe now\u2019s a good time to re-examine why you\u2019re with this person instead of someone who can be loyal and supportive.",

There are many relationships that transcend the standard transactional format! We know that.\n\nPersonally this is a time for everyone who can help to step up and help. I have given help to a few SBs from my past life. I have not given them help for sexual favors but I have given them help because I saw them as good strong hardworking people who are now facing a crisis for no fault of them. \nDid it occur to me that they may have other SDs who might also be helping, yes but I could care less.

I thought I was pretty clear before but I guess I will explain it more slowly....?\n\nFirst of all, of course I wouldn\u2019t stop seeing my SD if he lost his job. This is a result of many reasons, but one of those reasons that is pertinent to this conversation is that my SD has a rather large amount of investments and money set aside\u2014he doesn\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck. He would be able to find another job fairly easily. If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

I\u2019m asking why you would kick a sugar baby to the curb because just she\u2019s temporarily quarantined even though she\u2019s still capable of providing \u201centertainment\u201d?\n\nIt seems like the crux of the post is not that the OP\u2019s sugar baby has left him bereft of all sexual experiences\u2014which would basically be a breakup and of course he shouldn\u2019t give her money\u2014but that she can\u2019t specifically have sex with him right now this very second.

No jewelry none of the expensive things that were purchased.

You can\u2019t bring something to the table from here on then they can keep stepping.

Sugaring and prostitution would differ here where prostitution is mainly about transactional sex, whereas sugaring is more about maintaining relationship styled interactions that aren't completely based on sex. So it comes down to the relationship. The PPM is not really sugaring then? If a sugar baby starts charging you more to have sex twice, that's not a true sugaring relationship and then not paying them during a crisis would be relevant. However, if you have a mini relationship, that changes everything. I think that makes sense to me. What would be some examples of differentiating sugaring and prostitution?",

Well, that depends on what \"honey\" is. Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

No jewelry none of the expensive things that were purchased. But guess what she has constantly called and tried to black mail me and use me for money in any way she can.   \nMy point here is 99% of the bowl is her for pretty and shiny objects. They don\u2019t care about the sd or his situation just like fuck boys and sugar mommas. Me I help out one right now but let me tell you this and she knows it to when this is over. You can\u2019t bring something to the table from here on then they can keep stepping. One thing I have learned since my marriage ended is that young women still find me attractive and want me at 48 and don\u2019t expect money and most are actually mire intelligent and better off financially than any one I met in Sa or any ppm sites out there.",

Sugaring and prostitution would differ here where prostitution is mainly about transactional sex, whereas sugaring is more about maintaining relationship styled interactions that aren't completely based on sex. So it comes down to the relationship. The PPM is not really sugaring then? If a sugar baby starts charging you more to have sex twice, that's not a true sugaring relationship and then not paying them during a crisis would be relevant. However, if you have a mini relationship, that changes everything. I think that makes sense to me. What would be some examples of differentiating sugaring and prostitution?",

Well, that depends on what \"honey\" is. Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

I thought I was pretty clear before but I guess I will explain it more slowly....?\n\nFirst of all, of course I wouldn\u2019t stop seeing my SD if he lost his job. This is a result of many reasons, but one of those reasons that is pertinent to this conversation is that my SD has a rather large amount of investments and money set aside\u2014he doesn\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck. He would be able to find another job fairly easily. If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

We were seeing each other for seven months at that point. He was a lot to handle, but I cared for him and the future stability on our relationship. That means I missed out on a significant amount of money to demonstrate my appreciation for who he is and what he did for me.  We are having digital lunch on Wednesday as friends. It pays off if it works for YOUR SR.

No jewelry none of the expensive things that were purchased. But guess what she has constantly called and tried to black mail me and use me for money in any way she can.   \nMy point here is 99% of the bowl is her for pretty and shiny objects. They don\u2019t care about the sd or his situation just like fuck boys and sugar mommas. Me I help out one right now but let me tell you this and she knows it to when this is over. You can\u2019t bring something to the table from here on then they can keep stepping. One thing I have learned since my marriage ended is that young women still find me attractive and want me at 48 and don\u2019t expect money and most are actually mire intelligent and better off financially than any one I met in Sa or any ppm sites out there.",

Sugaring and prostitution would differ here where prostitution is mainly about transactional sex, whereas sugaring is more about maintaining relationship styled interactions that aren't completely based on sex. So it comes down to the relationship. The PPM is not really sugaring then? If a sugar baby starts charging you more to have sex twice, that's not a true sugaring relationship and then not paying them during a crisis would be relevant. However, if you have a mini relationship, that changes everything. I think that makes sense to me. What would be some examples of differentiating sugaring and prostitution?",

Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

I thought I was pretty clear before but I guess I will explain it more slowly....?\n\nFirst of all, of course I wouldn\u2019t stop seeing my SD if he lost his job. This is a result of many reasons, but one of those reasons that is pertinent to this conversation is that my SD has a rather large amount of investments and money set aside\u2014he doesn\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck. He would be able to find another job fairly easily. If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

Sugaring and prostitution would differ here where prostitution is mainly about transactional sex, whereas sugaring is more about maintaining relationship styled interactions that aren't completely based on sex. So it comes down to the relationship. The PPM is not really sugaring then? If a sugar baby starts charging you more to have sex twice, that's not a true sugaring relationship and then not paying them during a crisis would be relevant. However, if you have a mini relationship, that changes everything. I think that makes sense to me. What would be some examples of differentiating sugaring and prostitution?",

Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

This is a result of many reasons, but one of those reasons that is pertinent to this conversation is that my SD has a rather large amount of investments and money set aside\u2014he doesn\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck. He would be able to find another job fairly easily. If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

Sugaring and prostitution would differ here where prostitution is mainly about transactional sex, whereas sugaring is more about maintaining relationship styled interactions that aren't completely based on sex. So it comes down to the relationship. The PPM is not really sugaring then? If a sugar baby starts charging you more to have sex twice, that's not a true sugaring relationship and then not paying them during a crisis would be relevant. However, if you have a mini relationship, that changes everything. I think that makes sense to me. What would be some examples of differentiating sugaring and prostitution?",

Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

This is a result of many reasons, but one of those reasons that is pertinent to this conversation is that my SD has a rather large amount of investments and money set aside\u2014he doesn\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck. He would be able to find another job fairly easily. If he suddenly went completely flat broke, then I would be worrying about a lot more than a sugar relationship because that would mean that the apocalypse was probably imminent. \n\nSecond, there is a big difference between losing one\u2019s source of income/becoming broke and a quarantine caused by a virus. The fact that the first thing is somewhat more permanent and the second is temporary is\u2014I hope\u2014fairly obvious. But beyond that, a sugar daddy becoming broke changes the *nature* of the relationship. If you can not longer afford a sugar baby, you have ceased to be a sugar daddy. Me being in quarantine does not change the fact that I am still capable of providing \u201csugar.\u201d I can still send sexy texts, fun pictures.... we can have sexy phone calls or intimate video chats.... I even have a vibrator that can be turned on by an app in his phone! \n\nFinally, my sugar daddy is a huge germaphobe. This whole pandemic has been making him extremely anxious and scared. He appreciates me being available to text and call when he gets freaked out. I like being able to make him laugh by sending him a cute pic of me in nothing but a painter\u2019s mask when he\u2019s worried. \n\n*That* is the difference between a prostitution and a sugar relationship.",

Honey isn't supposed to be just sex, it's the overall value of what the SB provides. So an SB can still give honey during a crisis since honey isn't just sex and the SBs role isn't a prostitute. However, if we take my definition of honey, is it still objectifying the sb? If she is not providing love, compassion, feminine energy and so on, then I don't agree that the SD should continue to pay. SDs can be objectified as well. I also think when you have a good working relationship with someone, you should be more lenient. Like mortgage companies right now giving someone a break who can't pay their bills. Ah, looks like I just answered my own question. So if we take the mortgage example, we'd like the mortgage company to give a break in times of hardship, but we'd never expect the one with a mortgage to give a break to the mortgage company. We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion. How'd I do? I think that little trip just changed my life in how I view transactions based upon power structures with huge imbalances. It's objectifying to an SB because of her weakened position, whereas the SD can't really be objectified in the same way due to his extremity of power.",

We'd never expect the people with mortgages to pay a little extra to help the bank out, that'd be absurd. So this becomes a power mechanic. The SDs have near unlimited power in the arrangement, so, if there's a time for one to bend, it should be the SD because we understand that having power leaning to one side so much is damaging and we look to employ policy and logic that evens out the score in a reasonable fashion.

I\u2019m asking why you would kick a sugar baby to the curb because just she\u2019s temporarily quarantined even though she\u2019s still capable of providing \u201centertainment\u201d?\n\nIt seems like the crux of the post is not that the OP\u2019s sugar baby has left him bereft of all sexual experiences\u2014which would basically be a breakup and of course he shouldn\u2019t give her money\u2014but that she can\u2019t specifically have sex with him right now this very second. There are other sexual activities and experiences that are still fun.",
