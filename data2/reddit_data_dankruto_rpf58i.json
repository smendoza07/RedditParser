When was the last time Sasuke used one of his many variations of chidori? It was during Shippuden, unlike now where he only uses his basic defualt chidori. At this point a Rinnegan is just a regular sharingan with new design. It got so nerfed that a regular Uchiha's mangekyo is even probably stronger, remember when a Rinnegan was hailed as \"the eyes of a god\"? Nagato is basically the only one who properly used his Rinnegan's abilities to their full extent, which is funny since he was not even his eye's true owner (Madara was).",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

As is, the turning point for sasuke directly mirrors the same point for hashirama and madara, where hashirama was about to kill himself to keep the peace. Except obviously the peace didn\u2019t last. If, on the other hand, sasuke had come to that conclusion on his own, it would represent unprecedented progress in the indra/ashura conflict.\n\nHim wanting to become the threat that the whole world has to rally against is unsustainable anyway.

He had such a knowledge of chakra that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being nerfed.\"\n\n\"He could actually... save people from weakness?\"\n\n\"The Six Paths of the Rinnegan is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\"\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice stabbed him in the eye that gave him his power. Ironic.

At this point a Rinnegan is just a regular sharingan with new design. It got so nerfed that a regular Uchiha's mangekyo is even probably stronger, remember when a Rinnegan was hailed as \"the eyes of a god\"? Nagato is basically the only one who properly used his Rinnegan's abilities to their full extent, which is funny since he was not even his eye's true owner (Madara was).",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

I\u2019m just saying I wish sasuke had come to that conclusion earlier in the story (like around the time he and naruto did the Kurama mode/susanoo combo thing). As is, the turning point for sasuke directly mirrors the same point for hashirama and madara, where hashirama was about to kill himself to keep the peace. Except obviously the peace didn\u2019t last. If, on the other hand, sasuke had come to that conclusion on his own, it would represent unprecedented progress in the indra/ashura conflict.\n\nHim wanting to become the threat that the whole world has to rally against is unsustainable anyway. He\u2019ll die at some point and then they\u2019d be back where they started. It just felt really hollow to me",

Sasuke Uchiha was the last of the Uchiha, so powerful and so wise he could use the Rinnegan to influence chakra to create... life... He had such a knowledge of chakra that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being nerfed.\"\n\n\"He could actually... save people from weakness?\"\n\n\"The Six Paths of the Rinnegan is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\"\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice stabbed him in the eye that gave him his power. Ironic. He could save others from nerfs, but not himself.\"\n\n\"Is it possible to learn this power?\"\n\n\"Not from a Stone Ninja.\"",

Amenotejikara spam to launch hit-and-run attacks, Boil Release: Unrivalled Strength (that shit was OP as fuck, Teen Naruto used it to punch out Kaguya ffs), Deva Path to push away chakra rods/pull in Isshiki towards an attack (he could resist the force but the mere presence of the force would be enough to slow down Isshiki's movement and pressure him), Kirin optimized for rapid deployment, etc., the possibilities of making Naruto and Sasuke look like better fighters were endless.",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

I\u2019m just saying I wish sasuke had come to that conclusion earlier in the story (like around the time he and naruto did the Kurama mode/susanoo combo thing). As is, the turning point for sasuke directly mirrors the same point for hashirama and madara, where hashirama was about to kill himself to keep the peace. Except obviously the peace didn\u2019t last. If, on the other hand, sasuke had come to that conclusion on his own, it would represent unprecedented progress in the indra/ashura conflict.\n\nHim wanting to become the threat that the whole world has to rally against is unsustainable anyway. He\u2019ll die at some point and then they\u2019d be back where they started. It just felt really hollow to me",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

Amenotejikara spam to launch hit-and-run attacks, Boil Release: Unrivalled Strength (that shit was OP as fuck, Teen Naruto used it to punch out Kaguya ffs), Deva Path to push away chakra rods/pull in Isshiki towards an attack (he could resist the force but the mere presence of the force would be enough to slow down Isshiki's movement and pressure him), Kirin optimized for rapid deployment, etc., the possibilities of making Naruto and Sasuke look like better fighters were endless.",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back.

I\u2019m just saying I wish sasuke had come to that conclusion earlier in the story (like around the time he and naruto did the Kurama mode/susanoo combo thing). As is, the turning point for sasuke directly mirrors the same point for hashirama and madara, where hashirama was about to kill himself to keep the peace. Except obviously the peace didn\u2019t last. If, on the other hand, sasuke had come to that conclusion on his own, it would represent unprecedented progress in the indra/ashura conflict.\n\nHim wanting to become the threat that the whole world has to rally against is unsustainable anyway. He\u2019ll die at some point and then they\u2019d be back where they started. It just felt really hollow to me",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

As is, the turning point for sasuke directly mirrors the same point for hashirama and madara, where hashirama was about to kill himself to keep the peace. Except obviously the peace didn\u2019t last. If, on the other hand, sasuke had come to that conclusion on his own, it would represent unprecedented progress in the indra/ashura conflict.\n\nHim wanting to become the threat that the whole world has to rally against is unsustainable anyway. He\u2019ll die at some point and then they\u2019d be back where they started. It just felt really hollow to me",

Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",

I\u2019m just saying I wish sasuke had come to that conclusion earlier in the story (like around the time he and naruto did the Kurama mode/susanoo combo thing). As is, the turning point for sasuke directly mirrors the same point for hashirama and madara, where hashirama was about to kill himself to keep the peace. Except obviously the peace didn\u2019t last. If, on the other hand, sasuke had come to that conclusion on his own, it would represent unprecedented progress in the indra/ashura conflict.\n\nHim wanting to become the threat that the whole world has to rally against is unsustainable anyway. He\u2019ll die at some point and then they\u2019d be back where they started. It just felt really hollow to me",

            "body": "You're missing the point. Sasuke's development during the War was leading up to this. Sasuke sides with the alliance because \"he doesn't want Itachi's sacrifice to be for nothing\" not out of any love for the village. If Madara won, then Itachi's sacrifice meant nothing. Sasuke's goal is to ensure that something like Itachi's sacrifice would never happen again.\n\n\nTo Sasuke, the Ninja Alliance wasn't the start of a permanent friendship. It was a temporary alliance that would fray apart as nationalistic interests took precedence and before you know that we're back at the status quo because historically that is how things had happened. And if there was anyone who would not stand for the status quo it is Sasuke Uchiha. Hence why he felt that he needed to create a new global conflict to force that temporary alliance to stay together. And the easiest way to do that was to kill the Kage as they were important and were the symbols of the ninja world that Sasuke wanted to move away from.\n\nWhen Sasuke changes his mind after fighting Naruto it isn't on a whim. It's because he sees just how committed Naruto is to the idea of peace through cooperation because of just how far he is willing to go to bring Sasuke back. And then he sees Naruto's memories and how despite all odds Naruto has proven that he is capable of that time and again and Sasuke starts to believe in him.",
