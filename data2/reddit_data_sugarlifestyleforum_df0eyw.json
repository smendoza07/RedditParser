    "body": "I connected with a new guy via WhatsYourPrice on Sunday after he made a $150 offer for a date. We met at a restaurant of my choosing for dinner, and I had an amazing time being wined and dined by this really kind, humorous, interesting, successful guy who wasn\u2019t weird about me being trans. Not a single red flag all night, and he slipped me the cash very discretely like a gentleman. We had such a good time, I forgot to even mention a potential arrangement, and I couldn\u2019t help but kiss him after (turns out he\u2019s a great kisser too).\n\nShortly after we parted ways, he texted me asking if I would like to come over for dinner at his place the very next night, and that he would like to cook for me. Normally, I would have said HELL NO, because that\u2019s how you get drugged and raped or axe murdered. But I have a strong intuition, and everything about him read as genuine and well-intentioned.\n\nSo, I accepted, and it was incredible. I had one of the most romantic nights of my life, and I was in bliss. We both love seafood more than anything, and he made red snapper with curry, rice pilaf, scallops, and spinach on his outdoor stove inbetween snuggles. It was a new recipe he\u2019d never tried before, and it turned out great! It was kind of adorable to watch him try and cook by candlelight to maintain the mood though \ud83e\udd2d\n\nBut, I wasn\u2019t going to let myself be dazzled beyond discussing an allowance this time, so I brought it up as we finished eating. The conversation went smoothly, and he agreed to my per-meet proposal without protest. Things got pretty steamy on the couch from there. My only complaint is that he is tragically vanilla, but he\u2019s a naturally dominant enough person that it worked out great. And he loves my body a lot, exactly the way it is, which is really reassuring when I\u2019m normally fighting off the brain weasels of dysphoria.\n\nWe wrapped it up eventually, and he gave me my allowance without me having to ask. We kissed a lot, and I was honestly sad to go. I\u2019m still stunned and amazed, and it\u2019s all so surreal and exciting all at once. I let him know when I got home safely, and thanked him for the incredible night. I\u2019m going to have to find some way to up my game next time lol.\n\nThis is all to say, I\u2019m a trans girl in a small city, and if I can find someone genuine and amazing, so can you. \ud83d\udc96",

It also means more broke guys who are willing to drop $100 on a first date in search of a traditional relationship afterward as an icebreaker. There also appear to be a LOT less people on WYP in general, so the pool is a bit small and slow. I made a Successful account as well to look at the competition in my area, and it was immediately obvious how many girls had no clue what they were doing. If you have good photos and can stand out as someone serious, you\u2019ll have a huge leg up on the rest, but I suppose that goes for any site.\n\nGood luck!",

It also means more broke guys who are willing to drop $100 on a first date in search of a traditional relationship afterward as an icebreaker. There also appear to be a LOT less people on WYP in general, so the pool is a bit small and slow. I made a Successful account as well to look at the competition in my area, and it was immediately obvious how many girls had no clue what they were doing. If you have good photos and can stand out as someone serious, you\u2019ll have a huge leg up on the rest, but I suppose that goes for any site.\n\nGood luck!",
