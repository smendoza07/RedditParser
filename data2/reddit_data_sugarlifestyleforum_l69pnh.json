    "body": "This post is directed towards all the lurking SBs on here. Safety, particularly for SBs, comes up every so often but I feel can get muddled in all the posting that goes on this sub. This will probably get hate, but I don't care. \n\nDo NOT EVER assume these men you meet (whether they claim to be an SD or not) have your best interest. Remember that they are there with you to fulfill their own interest first. Stand your ground firmly. No amount of money can ever buy your mental health, your body, or any part of you. Do not let \"SDs\" guilt you for not trusting them immediately. When do you ever fully trust a random man you just met? Never. Sugar or not, trust takes time. Even after trust is built, people can be full of surprises. \n\nSDs on reddit are NOT representative of most SDs online. (Most) SDs on reddit who post and comment are actual gems, whereas the 90k+ other members of this sub lurking around can take proper SD language and tactics to manipulate you into a situation you are not comfortable with. \n\nUs SBs are young, we have a full life ahead of us. If any part of you doubts any situation, leave. You do not need permission to do what feels safe for you. You do not need to apologize for putting yourself first. You do not owe anyone ANYTHING. You are your biggest and often times, the only one to advocate for you. \n\nAlso, \"SDs\" who continue to push after any mention of discomfort, you can go unkindly fuck off. You're a creep and that is not okay and I am fully shaming you.\n\n\n\nan addendum: thank you everyone for the awards! i don't know why I thought I'd get a bit of push back, so thanks again! but again, (to the lurking SBs), this comment section is NOT representative of all \"SDs\". This comment section, GEMS! Cannot say the same for anyone outside of this comment section here.",

Grab a beverage of your choice and get what others pay thousands to hear. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNtXjIiJ0PU\n\nAs you listen translate this to your discussion with a man, many years your senior, whom you have never met before. His adult experience is two  to ten times yours.  If he is married all you know is that he is probably good at deception.  If he is successful he has learned how to motivate and charm people.  You need to arm yourself with better situational awareness. \n\ndeBecker is all about situational awareness and recognizing threats.  The great part of this is you are looking for threats by looking at the big picture, not through simplistic rules of engagement stuff. \n\n         Does this clown deBecker really have anything to offer me?  Well, his 20 questions to evaluate the prospect of domestic violence , used by most police departments in the pre digital age  were applied to OJ , sadly after the LAPD and his wife overlooked many messages. \n\nOn a scale of 1-20   OJ scored a perfect 20.  It was a near certainty that OJ would commit a violent act. (( Yes I know that OJ was \"found not guilty\" but have enough direct knowledge of the case to assure you that he is, but, that's not important)  \n\n3.  Rather than worrying about buying the perfect outfit for your first M&G invest the time to listen to deBecker and search out his checklist. \n\n4.  You'll not be on the journey by yourselves.  Young Marines sent into the confused environment of foreign cities are exposed to Left of Bang, a classic study on recognizing danger that builds on many of deBecker's foundational thoughts.   It's also an interesting read. \n\nTX poly aptly describes them as personal boundaries. I think it is important to have very specific limits, but also equally important to have the situational awareness to detect situations where the perp has been careful not to trip the limits but still poses an immediate significant threat to dissolve the limits through intimidation, charm, extortion or physical threats/abuse(plus drugs) .",

For women who come from a middle class life or poorer, rich people can be intimidating. They have everything you want or need.\n\nIn my case I was allured with lots of money and travel. My biggest dreams in life were to travel the world, shop like a princess, have lots of money and just culture myself. With my SD offering so much of this, I consciously blurred my boundaries for him. Now I\u2019m in the process of reinstating some boundaries, and obviously it\u2019s hard. \n\nAs simple as it is to say \u201cNo\u201d, the context, possible (negative) implications and the pestering that follows suite sometimes make its VERY hard to uphold that boundary.\n\nSo NO. This can\u2019t be said enough. Thank you for your post.",

Grab a beverage of your choice and get what others pay thousands to hear. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNtXjIiJ0PU\n\nAs you listen translate this to your discussion with a man, many years your senior, whom you have never met before. His adult experience is two  to ten times yours.  If he is married all you know is that he is probably good at deception.  If he is successful he has learned how to motivate and charm people.  You need to arm yourself with better situational awareness. \n\ndeBecker is all about situational awareness and recognizing threats.  The great part of this is you are looking for threats by looking at the big picture, not through simplistic rules of engagement stuff. \n\n         Does this clown deBecker really have anything to offer me?  Well, his 20 questions to evaluate the prospect of domestic violence , used by most police departments in the pre digital age  were applied to OJ , sadly after the LAPD and his wife overlooked many messages. \n\nOn a scale of 1-20   OJ scored a perfect 20.  It was a near certainty that OJ would commit a violent act. (( Yes I know that OJ was \"found not guilty\" but have enough direct knowledge of the case to assure you that he is, but, that's not important)  \n\n3.  Rather than worrying about buying the perfect outfit for your first M&G invest the time to listen to deBecker and search out his checklist. \n\n4.  You'll not be on the journey by yourselves.  Young Marines sent into the confused environment of foreign cities are exposed to Left of Bang, a classic study on recognizing danger that builds on many of deBecker's foundational thoughts.   It's also an interesting read. \n\nTX poly aptly describes them as personal boundaries. I think it is important to have very specific limits, but also equally important to have the situational awareness to detect situations where the perp has been careful not to trip the limits but still poses an immediate significant threat to dissolve the limits through intimidation, charm, extortion or physical threats/abuse(plus drugs) .",
