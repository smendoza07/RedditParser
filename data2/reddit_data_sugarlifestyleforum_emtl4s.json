    "body": "Maybe I\u2019m getting too into my fantasies but I think I\u2019m either too wild for some men or it\u2019s just budget tight this time of year and it\u2019s effecting their sex drive. \n\nThis man asked me what my biggest fantasy was, so I told him. \n\n\u201cA day of shopping then dinner on a yacht and hours of sex under the stars on the back of the boat so we can move with the ocean over and over again\u201d \n\nAnd he seemed to kind of panic. \n\nIt\u2019s just a fantasy, I\u2019m not asking you to buy me a yacht.\n\nWtf.",

Main variables are the size and age of the boat, the season (off or peak). You might even find some AirBnb yachts where you just stay in the marina for considerably less. Highly recommend.",

I'd probably follow up and ask more explicitly what you desire in the bedroom though, because that is why most men ask that question.\n\nWith that said, a part of me would be disappointed by any focus on the material things as a source of the turn on. I could handle you being turned on by things that I couldn't give you that are sexual, like a BBC or a 20 year old's ripped 6-pack, or even some kinks that I would never be into.\n\nThis is advice, intended to help you understand the male mind, not criticism.",

There are SRs where the SD is focused on spoiling the SB. And most are in between where each party wants to give to the other. There is no right or wrong way to SR and no judgement to any type. But the OPs answer would make me suspect she is not a giver and JUST wants to be spoiled. That might be a false assumption. But for me that isn't the type of relationship I would be interested in.",

I would have enough time to do the things I love and own a business doing pottery and selling art. \n\nI would go to Brooklyn find a kind of broken down garage and set up a pottery training class on raku. It would be a model where you can pay any price you want to take the class and all extra proceeds go to a shelter in the area.\n\nThere would be oil drums or trashcans on the side of the building to use as kilns and people from the shelter would help for extra money.\n\nWhile we wait for our pottery to fire, we could have a band playing with wine and Roberta\u2019s pizza. \n\nEveryone wears hemp.\n\nThat is my biggest fantasy.",

There are SRs where the SD is focused on spoiling the SB. And most are in between where each party wants to give to the other. There is no right or wrong way to SR and no judgement to any type. But the OPs answer would make me suspect she is not a giver and JUST wants to be spoiled. That might be a false assumption. But for me that isn't the type of relationship I would be interested in.",
