    "body": "Prior to my SD I loved having my hair short and crazy colored. I wore my doc martens and thrifted my clothes. I was content in myself.\n\nNow that I\u2019m with my SD, he has slowly over the course of a year hinted and helped me evolve my style to more his taste. That is elegant, cleaned up, natural, and expensive. He doesn\u2019t mind dropping $1k on an outfit or new bag, as long as I\u2019m up to par with the surrounding women. He\u2019s explicitly said that before.\n\nAnd I guess that has been the hardest part about sugaring. My style has turned from a form of self expression (rebellion, un materialistic, trendy) to more an exhibition of wealth (jewelry, designer clothes, natural colors). But I guess it\u2019s been a boot camp on how to blend in with the wealthy. \n\n\nBecause tbh, don\u2019t tell my SD.....but I don\u2019t care about the thousands of dollars he has spent on jewelry or the $2k he dropped on my new LV bag. It\u2019s to all create his fantasy of being his feminine mistress.\n\nI just can\u2019t wait until I have amassed my own fortune to have the liberty of dressing like a mountain man. To cut my hair, have piercings, wear thriftier clothes and not wear makeup. To move into the mountains, have a pot farm, love my family, and have tons of cats. Hahaha. \n\nI hate how materialistic I have to be. Seriously no shade to other SBs. It\u2019s just a rat race in having the cutest bag, perfect hair, put together outfit, etc.\n\nEdit: to all the SDs seeing red. Although there have been some growing pains, the change overall isn\u2019t bad. As I\u2019m only  21 I\u2019m learning to become a lady and am immersing myself in a new lifestyle I\u2019m not familiar with. I am absolutely 100% happy with my SD. We are each others best friends and lovers. He has pulled me out of some tough times and I repay him with tons of love and affection because I truly am in love with him and everything he has done for me. Even though it\u2019s weird changing my clothes, I would do anything for him because I love him. \n\nTo the people saying why don\u2019t I leave him? I understand I\u2019m a developing adult. I am open to change, because that is how you learn. The cleaning up process isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019m learning etiquette and how to fit in with the wealthy. I think these lessons are invaluable. \n\nAlso. If someone was paying for your every expense, frequent shopping trips, college tuition, and first class international travel once a month, I know 90% of you would want to appease to your SDs taste. WHO CARES? Nothing in life is free. If my cost is to dress more elegantly and bite my tongue a little.....I DONT CARE. He does so much for me, the least I could do is took good for him.\n\nAgain, sugaring is t always easy. Just because I found this to be the \u201chardest\u201d part, doesn\u2019t mean I should throw the whole man away. He is a great man to me",

Have a general idea for a project and the placement on your body, then look at it as a marathon and not a sprint\n2. Research custom tattoo artists and find the one whose work you like best and talk to them about your ideas, and go with the one whose vision best fits yours. So many people want to get overly specific about every aspect of the design, but a good tattoo artist knows what works best in that medium, and so many other people are worried about convenience and price rather than the right artistic fit for something that will be with you for life",

If you feel that this lifestyle is truly compromising your authenticity, perhaps it's time to reconsider.",

I had a LT Ex-GF that tried to mold me over the years and I saw my style change gradually and became less of myself to please her. Having been threw that and knowing what it did to my self esteem and sense of identity, I would never knowingly want someone to do that for me.

If you hate materialism then get out of the sugar lifestyle. Sugar ($$$) is right in the name. If your SD likes long hair and you like short hair, then so be it.

She just doesn\u2019t like how she\u2019s had to change to live in the world of the wealthy that she now inhabits. And she can\u2019t wait to be independently wealthy so she can leave that world.

But my impression is that for most SBs, sugaring is not about materialism, it\u2019s about getting a leg up in a hard world, or even survival.  For every one SB who wants to sugar so they can live lavishly and own LV handbags, there are twenty who want to pay off their student loans and just a get an easier and better start in the world. Since we know that OP has given up a lot of her \u201cself\u201d  in order to maintain her sugar relationship, I think she is almost certainly in that latter category, and for that she deserves empathy. I also think, knowing that one of the things that she misses about her old life is thrift store shopping, that her \u201cmaterialism\u201d involved in LV handbags and expensive outfits is something that has been foisted upon her by her SD and not something intrinsic to her, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s truly materialistic at all. \n\nI would also like to say that I cannot understand the PoV of her SD at all.  He must be a 1%er (or an aspiring one) obviously trying to keep up with the Rockefellers. Fuck that. I love thrift store shopping.",

So many people want to get overly specific about every aspect of the design, but a good tattoo artist knows what works best in that medium, and so many other people are worried about convenience and price rather than the right artistic fit for something that will be with you for life",

But my impression is that for most SBs, sugaring is not about materialism, it\u2019s about getting a leg up in a hard world, or even survival.  For every one SB who wants to sugar so they can live lavishly and own LV handbags, there are twenty who want to pay off their student loans and just a get an easier and better start in the world. Since we know that OP has given up a lot of her \u201cself\u201d  in order to maintain her sugar relationship, I think she is almost certainly in that latter category, and for that she deserves empathy. I also think, knowing that one of the things that she misses about her old life is thrift store shopping, that her \u201cmaterialism\u201d involved in LV handbags and expensive outfits is something that has been foisted upon her by her SD and not something intrinsic to her, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s truly materialistic at all. \n\nI would also like to say that I cannot understand the PoV of her SD at all.  He must be a 1%er (or an aspiring one) obviously trying to keep up with the Rockefellers. Fuck that. I love thrift store shopping.",

But my impression is that for most SBs, sugaring is not about materialism, it\u2019s about getting a leg up in a hard world, or even survival.  For every one SB who wants to sugar so they can live lavishly and own LV handbags, there are twenty who want to pay off their student loans and just a get an easier and better start in the world. Since we know that OP has given up a lot of her \u201cself\u201d  in order to maintain her sugar relationship, I think she is almost certainly in that latter category, and for that she deserves empathy. I also think, knowing that one of the things that she misses about her old life is thrift store shopping, that her \u201cmaterialism\u201d involved in LV handbags and expensive outfits is something that has been foisted upon her by her SD and not something intrinsic to her, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s truly materialistic at all. \n\nI would also like to say that I cannot understand the PoV of her SD at all.  He must be a 1%er (or an aspiring one) obviously trying to keep up with the Rockefellers. Fuck that. I love thrift store shopping.",

But my impression is that for most SBs, sugaring is not about materialism, it\u2019s about getting a leg up in a hard world, or even survival.  For every one SB who wants to sugar so they can live lavishly and own LV handbags, there are twenty who want to pay off their student loans and just a get an easier and better start in the world. Since we know that OP has given up a lot of her \u201cself\u201d  in order to maintain her sugar relationship, I think she is almost certainly in that latter category, and for that she deserves empathy. I also think, knowing that one of the things that she misses about her old life is thrift store shopping, that her \u201cmaterialism\u201d involved in LV handbags and expensive outfits is something that has been foisted upon her by her SD and not something intrinsic to her, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s truly materialistic at all. \n\nI would also like to say that I cannot understand the PoV of her SD at all.  He must be a 1%er (or an aspiring one) obviously trying to keep up with the Rockefellers. Fuck that. I love thrift store shopping.",
