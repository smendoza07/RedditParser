Imo, boruto could've really been done well if they focused more on boruto being an academy ninja and genin. How the ninja system works in the new era, now unlike being an intel soldier you have a choice to pursue a different route. I would've loved that boruto is a gamer or just an otaku who has the potential to be powerful. But he just doesn't want to be a ninja like his forefathers. Fast forward to the academy he was doing mundane boruto anime stuff and the day everything should change is the arc with the girl having some sealed beast (i din watch much after that arc so i forgot) or heck even during the land of wave's expedition arc. It would force a non genin boruto to show how much taijutsu was trained unto him, then with a little simple shadow clone combo like his dad.\n\nFrom there it can be played so slow before he finds out how OP naruto was in his teens and what kind of gundam he has to fight in the shinobi world. But nah, just like every japanese product ever made. Power creeping is their favourite thing to do until they messed up so bad and got axed.",

Imo, boruto could've really been done well if they focused more on boruto being an academy ninja and genin. How the ninja system works in the new era, now unlike being an intel soldier you have a choice to pursue a different route. I would've loved that boruto is a gamer or just an otaku who has the potential to be powerful. But he just doesn't want to be a ninja like his forefathers. Fast forward to the academy he was doing mundane boruto anime stuff and the day everything should change is the arc with the girl having some sealed beast (i din watch much after that arc so i forgot) or heck even during the land of wave's expedition arc. It would force a non genin boruto to show how much taijutsu was trained unto him, then with a little simple shadow clone combo like his dad.\n\nFrom there it can be played so slow before he finds out how OP naruto was in his teens and what kind of gundam he has to fight in the shinobi world. But nah, just like every japanese product ever made. Power creeping is their favourite thing to do until they messed up so bad and got axed.",

Imo, boruto could've really been done well if they focused more on boruto being an academy ninja and genin. How the ninja system works in the new era, now unlike being an intel soldier you have a choice to pursue a different route. I would've loved that boruto is a gamer or just an otaku who has the potential to be powerful. But he just doesn't want to be a ninja like his forefathers. Fast forward to the academy he was doing mundane boruto anime stuff and the day everything should change is the arc with the girl having some sealed beast (i din watch much after that arc so i forgot) or heck even during the land of wave's expedition arc. It would force a non genin boruto to show how much taijutsu was trained unto him, then with a little simple shadow clone combo like his dad.\n\nFrom there it can be played so slow before he finds out how OP naruto was in his teens and what kind of gundam he has to fight in the shinobi world. But nah, just like every japanese product ever made. Power creeping is their favourite thing to do until they messed up so bad and got axed.",

Imo, boruto could've really been done well if they focused more on boruto being an academy ninja and genin. How the ninja system works in the new era, now unlike being an intel soldier you have a choice to pursue a different route. I would've loved that boruto is a gamer or just an otaku who has the potential to be powerful. But he just doesn't want to be a ninja like his forefathers. Fast forward to the academy he was doing mundane boruto anime stuff and the day everything should change is the arc with the girl having some sealed beast (i din watch much after that arc so i forgot) or heck even during the land of wave's expedition arc. It would force a non genin boruto to show how much taijutsu was trained unto him, then with a little simple shadow clone combo like his dad.\n\nFrom there it can be played so slow before he finds out how OP naruto was in his teens and what kind of gundam he has to fight in the shinobi world. But nah, just like every japanese product ever made. Power creeping is their favourite thing to do until they messed up so bad and got axed.",

Imo, boruto could've really been done well if they focused more on boruto being an academy ninja and genin. How the ninja system works in the new era, now unlike being an intel soldier you have a choice to pursue a different route. I would've loved that boruto is a gamer or just an otaku who has the potential to be powerful. But he just doesn't want to be a ninja like his forefathers. Fast forward to the academy he was doing mundane boruto anime stuff and the day everything should change is the arc with the girl having some sealed beast (i din watch much after that arc so i forgot) or heck even during the land of wave's expedition arc. It would force a non genin boruto to show how much taijutsu was trained unto him, then with a little simple shadow clone combo like his dad.\n\nFrom there it can be played so slow before he finds out how OP naruto was in his teens and what kind of gundam he has to fight in the shinobi world. But nah, just like every japanese product ever made. Power creeping is their favourite thing to do until they messed up so bad and got axed.",
