    "body": "I have three SB's. One locally I pay a monthly allowance and two in nearby cities (2-3 hour drive) I see on PPM when I visit relatives in those cities. Each knows my age and financial situation. And each knows about the other two.\n\nI am in my early 70's, in good shape, run 30-40 miles a week (sub 10 min pace) and do a couple or three marathons a year. That being said, I am still in the age group most likely to succumb to the virus\n\nI have a monthly income and do not need to liquidate assets to live or support my SB's as things currently stand. Of course, things can change, but I am healthy and solvent and my SB's know that.\n\n Given the above, the reaction of my SB's to the current situation vis-a-vis the virus and recession is startling. The local SB with the monthly allowance is really concerned about that allowance continuing and wants me to drop the others to make sure her payments continue. No mention or obvious concern for my health.\n\nSB #2 said we can have platonic dates when I visit her city for half her usual PPM to save me money (her words).  But wants to make sure I am still planning to make regular visits.\n\nSB#3 and the youngest of the three (early 20s) has not mentioned allowance, PPM or visits. Every conversation has been about my health and her concern. She has even offered to stay with me to do shopping and run errands so I don't have to go out and be exposed. She works from home so this is possible for her. This young lady is amazing. \n\nI think I may have to retire a couple SB's.",

Over about a decade and a half , for me it has become  about the whole SB - appearance, intelligence, character and of course SENSUALITY ... The SB's who hung out with Hugh Hefner and were models or actresses were perhaps the most \"looks generating when we were out\"   but generally intellectually and value  vacuous, not to mention sensually mechanized to run through the satisfaction program before shutting down and looking for the allowance before offering a hasty goodnight . (see you  when the rent's due)\n\nThe SB's whom I still hear from today preferred the Navajo Turquoise from around Taos to  stuff from Beverly Hills,  flyfishing in Oregon over clubbing in Hollywood, to discuss classic lit over today's Hollywood tales or lunch at Catalina's airport to shopping in Beverly Hills. \n\nOne of the greatest mistakes most newer SB's make is not defining whom the are and pursuing SD who match that profile.\n\nResponding to NB , most all of the SB's I have had over well over a decade have been attractive .  However, those selected primarily on the basis of looks and lust have been the shortest relationships",

You are the only thing on my mind in this global pandemic. Who cares if my grandma died of the virus, or my dad just got laid off. I only think and worry about you...\" then tell them. They are your workers. I think you can ask them to  make you have a greater GF experience. I don't think you should fire your SB. have more empathy. These are hard times for everyone.

Hes 60. he\u2019s really genuine and sweet and i enjoy him but he expects to see me at least 3-4 times a week for 1k a month. well he is married and because of that has a weird schedule and i live an hour away and work because i can\u2019t just drop everything. idk what to do. is this normal in ur opinion? is it worth it? i really like him which is why im giving him a break because I rather take a little less for someone I like but idk anymore because it makes me feel bad for never doing enough. also finding a sugar daddy with all the skeezballs out there, the whole process is so hard I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. I live in a city in America, not sure if that makes a diff. Anyways, got off topic, is he asking too much of me and is this normal to u is what I\u2019m wondering",

The SB's who hung out with Hugh Hefner and were models or actresses were perhaps the most \"looks generating when we were out\"   but generally intellectually and value  vacuous, not to mention sensually mechanized to run through the satisfaction program before shutting down and looking for the allowance before offering a hasty goodnight . (see you  when the rent's due)\n\nThe SB's whom I still hear from today preferred the Navajo Turquoise from around Taos to  stuff from Beverly Hills,  flyfishing in Oregon over clubbing in Hollywood, to discuss classic lit over today's Hollywood tales or lunch at Catalina's airport to shopping in Beverly Hills. \n\nOne of the greatest mistakes most newer SB's make is not defining whom the are and pursuing SD who match that profile.\n\nResponding to NB , most all of the SB's I have had over well over a decade have been attractive .

Over about a decade and a half , for me it has become  about the whole SB - appearance, intelligence, character and of course SENSUALITY ... The SB's who hung out with Hugh Hefner and were models or actresses were perhaps the most \"looks generating when we were out\"   but generally intellectually and value  vacuous, not to mention sensually mechanized to run through the satisfaction program before shutting down and looking for the allowance before offering a hasty goodnight . (see you  when the rent's due)\n\nThe SB's whom I still hear from today preferred the Navajo Turquoise from around Taos to  stuff from Beverly Hills,  flyfishing in Oregon over clubbing in Hollywood, to discuss classic lit over today's Hollywood tales or lunch at Catalina's airport to shopping in Beverly Hills. \n\nOne of the greatest mistakes most newer SB's make is not defining whom the are and pursuing SD who match that profile.\n\nResponding to NB , most all of the SB's I have had over well over a decade have been attractive .  However, those selected primarily on the basis of looks and lust have been the shortest relationships",

The SB's who hung out with Hugh Hefner and were models or actresses were perhaps the most \"looks generating when we were out\"   but generally intellectually and value  vacuous, not to mention sensually mechanized to run through the satisfaction program before shutting down and looking for the allowance before offering a hasty goodnight . (see you  when the rent's due)\n\nThe SB's whom I still hear from today preferred the Navajo Turquoise from around Taos to  stuff from Beverly Hills,  flyfishing in Oregon over clubbing in Hollywood, to discuss classic lit over today's Hollywood tales or lunch at Catalina's airport to shopping in Beverly Hills. \n\nOne of the greatest mistakes most newer SB's make is not defining whom the are and pursuing SD who match that profile.\n\nResponding to NB , most all of the SB's I have had over well over a decade have been attractive .  However, those selected primarily on the basis of looks and lust have been the shortest relationships",
