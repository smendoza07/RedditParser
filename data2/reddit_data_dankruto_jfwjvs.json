But thank you. I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

Saw the definition of loli didn't see when they updated as sexualizing little girls. At my best I used to know the term as flat chested short/young girl. But welp. And above you can see a guy named \"batfan54\" did you read THAT thread also? I explained what I meant there as well. If you say somethings bad it can't be bad. It could be meant as something else too. But that doesn't change I was the one who couldn't make myself clear. I apologize for that. and ya hit me but after you read that thread as well.",

But thank you. I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

Saw the definition of loli didn't see when they updated as sexualizing little girls. At my best I used to know the term as flat chested short/young girl. But welp. And above you can see a guy named \"batfan54\" did you read THAT thread also? I explained what I meant there as well. If you say somethings bad it can't be bad. It could be meant as something else too. But that doesn't change I was the one who couldn't make myself clear. I apologize for that. and ya hit me but after you read that thread as well.",

But thank you. I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

And even kid like boruto does the same \"sexy jutsu\" which naruto and konohamaru did.. who knows they will show hima doing that or not. but ya pedophilia is not cool at all. so ya cheers! xD",

Saw the definition of loli didn't see when they updated as sexualizing little girls. At my best I used to know the term as flat chested short/young girl. But welp. And above you can see a guy named \"batfan54\" did you read THAT thread also? I explained what I meant there as well. If you say somethings bad it can't be bad. It could be meant as something else too. But that doesn't change I was the one who couldn't make myself clear. I apologize for that. and ya hit me but after you read that thread as well.",

But thank you. I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I am not disagreeing the importance of your statement but just explaining what I meant there. And even kid like boruto does the same \"sexy jutsu\" which naruto and konohamaru did.. who knows they will show hima doing that or not. but ya pedophilia is not cool at all. so ya cheers! xD",

But I will one keyword which can make understand a bit. Alright, I didn't sexualize her at all it's the least I would do. And I clearly  meant her as loli as a short young girl . Saw the definition of loli didn't see when they updated as sexualizing little girls. At my best I used to know the term as flat chested short/young girl. But welp. And above you can see a guy named \"batfan54\" did you read THAT thread also? I explained what I meant there as well. If you say somethings bad it can't be bad. It could be meant as something else too. But that doesn't change I was the one who couldn't make myself clear. I apologize for that. and ya hit me but after you read that thread as well.",

But thank you. I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",

            "body": ">Your habit is writing as though you have autism or a developmental disability?\n\nNot at all. But thank you. I will use this chance as to fix my lazy/habital errors.  \n\n\n\" Sure, you're justifying sexualizing little girls. That's creepy.\"   \nYou said you have read my comments didn't you? Then HOW did my comments JUSTIFY SEXUALIZING girls? Even I said that's not cool. And to answer your confusion and everyones, let me ask you .   \nYou have seen naruto, naruto shippuden, boruto. I am pretty sure you have seen naruto,konohamaru,boruto as a KID did \"SEXY JUTSU\" so where did your \"creep call\" go? and I ask you to ATLEAST check up a bit HOW the japanese culture is. AND what if the anime franchise decided to show himawari doing \"Sexy Jutsu\" ? will you go \"hahahha.. soo funny,, my ass died yaay?\" don't lie :) where will your KewL philosophy go?   \n\n\nAnd like I said in my comments, pedophilia isn't cool at all. And I am not a creep either. There is a difference in whats to be intended and whats to be directed. And I could have deleted my comments to hide everything. But that would mean I have done wrong and hidden that. That would be more detestable. Instead of that I kept the comments to actually let people see what I meant. This isn't some cartoon network johnny test you are watching. Cheers. Have a good day and I hope you lead a good life with your real friends.",
