Or Sasuke (if you count him as an arc villain for the Sasuke retrieval stuff). Arguably Obito wasn\u2019t the main villain of the war arc, but I understand counting him. But either way, people really blow it out of proportion. Probably because of the memes. Not only is it not something exclusive to Naruto (though it is given more importance in the series), but it makes sense as well. Not to mention, like I said, only 2 changed their world views and such. Gaara (made sense) and Obito (made less sense). Nagito and Zabuza just has their true feelings come out, they didn\u2019t regret what they\u2019d done or change who they were. Nagito bet it all on Naruto, to see if he could do what Nagito was trying to do through fear and pain.\n\nYou could argue Sasuke changed as well, but it took multiple tries, and Naruto not only has to beat him down, but show him how much he was missing. Persistence that wore Sasuke down, basically. I feel like Sasuke more so just gave in, than changed who he was. His journey of solitude is what ultimately changed his way of thinking.",

Arguably Obito wasn\u2019t the main villain of the war arc, but I understand counting him. But either way, people really blow it out of proportion. Probably because of the memes. Not only is it not something exclusive to Naruto (though it is given more importance in the series), but it makes sense as well. Not to mention, like I said, only 2 changed their world views and such. Gaara (made sense) and Obito (made less sense). Nagito and Zabuza just has their true feelings come out, they didn\u2019t regret what they\u2019d done or change who they were. Nagito bet it all on Naruto, to see if he could do what Nagito was trying to do through fear and pain.\n\nYou could argue Sasuke changed as well, but it took multiple tries, and Naruto not only has to beat him down, but show him how much he was missing. Persistence that wore Sasuke down, basically. I feel like Sasuke more so just gave in, than changed who he was. His journey of solitude is what ultimately changed his way of thinking.",

Arguably Obito wasn\u2019t the main villain of the war arc, but I understand counting him. But either way, people really blow it out of proportion. Probably because of the memes. Not only is it not something exclusive to Naruto (though it is given more importance in the series), but it makes sense as well. Not to mention, like I said, only 2 changed their world views and such. Gaara (made sense) and Obito (made less sense). Nagito and Zabuza just has their true feelings come out, they didn\u2019t regret what they\u2019d done or change who they were. Nagito bet it all on Naruto, to see if he could do what Nagito was trying to do through fear and pain.\n\nYou could argue Sasuke changed as well, but it took multiple tries, and Naruto not only has to beat him down, but show him how much he was missing. Persistence that wore Sasuke down, basically. I feel like Sasuke more so just gave in, than changed who he was. His journey of solitude is what ultimately changed his way of thinking.",
