    "body": "Discretion is important to a lot of us, but many don't know the difference between 'discreet' (respecting privacy) and 'discrete' (separate and distinct). In order to help people out, I'm sharing my mnemonic. In 'discreet' the two e's are hiding out, together, between the other letters. In 'discete' they are separated. I like my arrangements discreet, not discrete.\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p22c9cn4hy51.jpg?width=557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ab4ba91d4b4f3e9f97ddeab0c4a55e7bb5a2e40",
