    "body": "Kinda inspired by Kwangsoo's announced departure.\n\nIt is pretty clear that Korean varieties normally don't have the longest and most stable runs. There were so many Korean varieties who faced cast changes due to scandals popping up within their members (AJH in NJTTW, NHC and Gil in IC, the whole cast after 1N2D S2)\n\nAnd even without scandals, millitary enlistments could ruin a shows whole dynamic if one of the members have to enlist. We are so lucky to have a young cast member which has actually enlisted early despite being the uncommon case within actors.\n\nTherefore, I feel like we don't appreciate enough that every single one of the members did not have any show-ending scandal for 11 years, thats a very uncommon phenomenon in Kvariety.\n\nEvery cast departure was an amicable one and had a presentable farewell unlike abrupt ones (leading to scenes being cut) which were caused by scandals.\n\nPlus, the fact that the show was literally sentenced to cancellation, uncancelled, saved by good PDs and continuing till now with most of the cast intact is probably a FIRST in such a competitive industry.\n\nWe are honestly blessed to still be able to watch RM now and I feel like we don't realize that enough.",

Recently though (especially after today) I realize that the show has been going on for 11 years and with the members quite aging now we're probably in the last few years of the show. After today's news I cant help but feel even more so like that. Going to be grateful for every single episode from here on out",

I was so sad to see the news of his departure as I am brand new to RM, but then I realized there are over *five hundred* episodes for me to go through. I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of that. The fact that ANY of them have been going this long, and in such a rigorous fashion, is an absolutely incredible testament to their commitment. Things don\u2019t last this long. They just don\u2019t. This show has already broken all the rules. It\u2019s sad that he\u2019s leaving of course, but we should be blown away that it\u2019s lasted this long at all.",

If it was about  that injury, he could just take an indefinite hiatus to recuperate and come  back whenever he's ready. We have to remember that Kwang Soo is first  and foremost a television drama actor. But due to his character on  Running Man, people tend to see him as a comedian and that hurts his  prospects for his acting career.",

With how Family Outing went out and how ratings were low in the beginning of RM, I never thought I would still be watching this show today, and I was just grateful every single week because it hadn't been canceled despite the ratings. When Song Joongki left, I admit, I had some anger because I felt he was bailing out due to the show's rankings. But the bond between this cast is just so different, which initially made Family Outing different on its own as well. But unlike FO, RM are actually friends who hang out and talk outside the show. I never felt that way with some of the cast in FO. \n\nI think RM is really special. It was the ignored underdog but has now become a global phenomenon. Online, I get angry about toxic fans, but I did go to RM's first fan meeting in HK in 2013, and the feeling it was to be amongst the fans and cheering on the cast... it was magic.",
