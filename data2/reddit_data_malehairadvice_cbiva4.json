            "body": "I don't know too much about keratin treatments but I do have the same natural hair type as you and I've solved this frizzy, course hair \"problem\" ages ago based on a tip from a hair dresser friend. I use a chemical relaxer treatment called Dark n Lovely. It's in the \"ethnic\" hair care section, but it basically gives you these exact same results you just had with the keratin treatment. It's about $7 a box (one treatment) and only takes about 10 minutes. It says to leave it in for 12-15 minutes but remember that this product is intended for very course African American hair. My hair is more Middle Eastern, course, but not *that* course. It's similar to yours. so I go very conservative on timing based on this understanding. It's a powerful chemical so every minute matters, but it's  safe if you follow the instructions. The results are permanent but obviously don't apply to new growth so I end up relaxing my hair about once a month to keep up. Just a tip to save you some time and money. Happy to provide more details if you'd like.",

                            "body": "I used to follow the instructions pretty strictly, and when it comes to the precautionary stuff I definitely still do by routine. But I've modified a few things over the years based on my needs and experiences.\n\nI try to make sure my hair is natural with no product in it when I decide to relax. I apply vaseline to my forehead, ears, and the back of my neck -- this creates a barrier which prevents chemical burns/redness should the relaxer make contact with your exposed skin. I mix the relaxer ingredients and then work the relaxer through my hair. I then take a comb and comb it back when my hair style is longer or forward when my hair style is shorter. The relaxer is very thick so it keeps the hair nice and straight for the time it's in. I've been told that it's basically a \"perm\" like the kind women used to get but instead of perming curls, it's perming \"straight\".\n\nThe relaxer product is designed for African American hair and says to leave it in for 12-15 minutes. My hair is more Middle Eastern, course but not that course, so I like to play things a bit more on the conservative side and just do 10 minutes.\n\nThen you rinse, apply this deactivator stuff it comes with, rinse that, then shampoo with the  shampoo stuff that it comes with. It's a pink color coded shampoo. Basically, you shampoo and rinse until the shampoo foam that washes up is white and no longer pink. This usually takes 2-3 shampoos for me. Once the pink is gone, I always give it one extra shampoo just to be sure I got it all.\n\nThen you use the conditioner it comes with and rinse.\n\nOnce you're done with the rinse, give it a towel dry and enjoy your gorgeous new relaxed hair. They give you a leave in conditioner treatment which they suggest you use for a couple days, but I just do it once and toss it. It's nice after the treatment, but the stuff is greasy and I've come to find more than one leave-in application unnecessary over the years. But that might just be me.\n\nFor the first day or so, your scalp might be a bit sensitive. Especially after your first couple times, but it should be very mild. If it's overly sensitive, you're probably leaving the relaxer in too long or you're letting it get too close to the scalp.  It's all about timing and contact, you learn after your first couple times. You don't have to cover every last mm of every single hair strand. Just work it in casually and comb straight.",

But I've modified a few things over the years based on my needs and experiences.\n\nI try to make sure my hair is natural with no product in it when I decide to relax. I apply vaseline to my forehead, ears, and the back of my neck -- this creates a barrier which prevents chemical burns/redness should the relaxer make contact with your exposed skin. I mix the relaxer ingredients and then work the relaxer through my hair. I then take a comb and comb it back when my hair style is longer or forward when my hair style is shorter. The relaxer is very thick so it keeps the hair nice and straight for the time it's in. I've been told that it's basically a \"perm\" like the kind women used to get but instead of perming curls, it's perming \"straight\".\n\nThe relaxer product is designed for African American hair and says to leave it in for 12-15 minutes. My hair is more Middle Eastern, course but not that course, so I like to play things a bit more on the conservative side and just do 10 minutes.\n\nThen you rinse, apply this deactivator stuff it comes with, rinse that, then shampoo with the  shampoo stuff that it comes with. It's a pink color coded shampoo. Basically, you shampoo and rinse until the shampoo foam that washes up is white and no longer pink. This usually takes 2-3 shampoos for me. Once the pink is gone, I always give it one extra shampoo just to be sure I got it all.\n\nThen you use the conditioner it comes with and rinse.\n\nOnce you're done with the rinse, give it a towel dry and enjoy your gorgeous new relaxed hair. They give you a leave in conditioner treatment which they suggest you use for a couple days, but I just do it once and toss it. It's nice after the treatment, but the stuff is greasy and I've come to find more than one leave-in application unnecessary over the years. But that might just be me.\n\nFor the first day or so, your scalp might be a bit sensitive. Especially after your first couple times, but it should be very mild. If it's overly sensitive, you're probably leaving the relaxer in too long or you're letting it get too close to the scalp.  It's all about timing and contact, you learn after your first couple times. You don't have to cover every last mm of every single hair strand. Just work it in casually and comb straight.",

But I've modified a few things over the years based on my needs and experiences.\n\nI try to make sure my hair is natural with no product in it when I decide to relax. I apply vaseline to my forehead, ears, and the back of my neck -- this creates a barrier which prevents chemical burns/redness should the relaxer make contact with your exposed skin. I mix the relaxer ingredients and then work the relaxer through my hair. I then take a comb and comb it back when my hair style is longer or forward when my hair style is shorter. The relaxer is very thick so it keeps the hair nice and straight for the time it's in. I've been told that it's basically a \"perm\" like the kind women used to get but instead of perming curls, it's perming \"straight\".\n\nThe relaxer product is designed for African American hair and says to leave it in for 12-15 minutes. My hair is more Middle Eastern, course but not that course, so I like to play things a bit more on the conservative side and just do 10 minutes.\n\nThen you rinse, apply this deactivator stuff it comes with, rinse that, then shampoo with the  shampoo stuff that it comes with. It's a pink color coded shampoo. Basically, you shampoo and rinse until the shampoo foam that washes up is white and no longer pink. This usually takes 2-3 shampoos for me. Once the pink is gone, I always give it one extra shampoo just to be sure I got it all.\n\nThen you use the conditioner it comes with and rinse.\n\nOnce you're done with the rinse, give it a towel dry and enjoy your gorgeous new relaxed hair. They give you a leave in conditioner treatment which they suggest you use for a couple days, but I just do it once and toss it. It's nice after the treatment, but the stuff is greasy and I've come to find more than one leave-in application unnecessary over the years. But that might just be me.\n\nFor the first day or so, your scalp might be a bit sensitive. Especially after your first couple times, but it should be very mild. If it's overly sensitive, you're probably leaving the relaxer in too long or you're letting it get too close to the scalp.  It's all about timing and contact, you learn after your first couple times. You don't have to cover every last mm of every single hair strand. Just work it in casually and comb straight.",
