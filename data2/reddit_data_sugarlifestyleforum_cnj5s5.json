    "body": "The last two months have mostly been spent with work, auditions, and hospital visits. I\u2019ve been neglecting a lot of my social life. Mostly because my friends and I don\u2019t share the same interests anymore. I\u2019m going back to school for my MBA, and they think it\u2019s a waste of time.\n\nI met my first SD on SA when I was 20. I was turning 21 in the next month after that. Which I think made him more comfortable. We were together for two and a half years, but it legitimately felt like yeeaarrsss (in a good way). He was the first and only person I ever met off of SA, so I got really lucky. He always talked about how I was an old soul and spoke my mind \u201cso much\u201d (in his words). I was \u201cso mature\u201d for my age. \u201cDon\u2019t settle\u201d, he said. \u201cYou deserve so much better\u201d, he said. \u201cI hope I can show you the world\u201d, he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be something great\u201d, he said. He is/was my favorite person and best friend.\n\nTwo months after we broke up, I found out he had cancer. I noticed his hair thinning and he was coughing a little too much. I thought it was his asthma, so I would carry an inhaler with me because he hated having his with him (it came in handy a good amount of times). I began to visit him at his condo in the morning and after work the last 8 months.. even though we had ended our \u201carrangement\u201d. I made him my favorite breakfasts and dinners. It was really terrifying thinking about him not living anymore.\n\nI got a call from his best friend saying he passed away. His attorney contacted me about my share in his will. Apparently he left me 30% of his assets to pay off my loans/grad school and then some... I had no idea he was doing this. At all. I want to slap him so hard right now haha. I want to cry, I want to laugh, I want to scream. All of the emotions are happening. My heart has been broken into a billion pieces because the day he passed was the ONE TIME I decided to go camping. After spending all of July with him in the hospital, he decides to leave when I\u2019m away. How selfish of him \ud83d\ude12. Haha I love him. I truly would not be the person I am today if he had never come into my life. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how someone you wouldn\u2019t normally meet shows up in your life and makes a difference. D, I miss you. I love you and Rest In Peace my lovey dovey. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this was a bit too corny for the SLF community but it\u2019s the only place I feel people can relate.\n\n\nEdit: I wish I had the time to respond to all of the replies. Thank you to every single person who liked, replied, and reached out to me for support. We\u2019re very fortunate to have this community and truly am grateful for all of the kind words. \n\nRemember to count your blessings, love people, and reach for the stars \u2728 \n\nOh, and thank you kind friend for my first gold. Such a sweet gesture. I hope everyone has a lovely day.",
