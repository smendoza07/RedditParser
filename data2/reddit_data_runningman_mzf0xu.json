Kwang Soo will just need to do a 100% recovery from his injury.. and maybe after 1-2 years or even 3 years from now, if running man is still here, he will have a  grand comeback. It is sad that he needs to leave because of his injury but it may end up worst if he will continue to push being in running man and possibly cost him an injury that he may not be able to recover anymore.",
