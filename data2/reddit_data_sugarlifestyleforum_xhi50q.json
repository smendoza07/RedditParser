    "body": "There\u2019s a common misconception that sbs are desperate or something. Because pot after pot demand that a sb will have unprotected sex. And while one may need the money, I am NOT going to abandon my boundaries to make money. The fact that guys are trying to pressure women into unprotected sex is disturbing as hell. They are careless and expect us to follow suit. Why would you trust a stranger with your life? Especially when a majority of sd are married? Willing to gamble with the health and life of your spouse too?! SMH. Frustrating",

The fact that guys are trying to pressure   \nwomen into unprotected sex is disturbing as hell\n\n\"Pressure\" would be bad, but your tone suggests you are attempting to shame the general choice.  Which makes you intolerant and the a-hole.  Let's analyze.\n\n* You should not compromise on what makes you comfortable, nor on what you want.\n* Similarly, they (SDs) should not compromise on what makes them comfortable or happy either.\n* In my civilian life, no condoms is the norm.  I can't speak for *your* civilian life; it isn't relevant to my lived experience anyhow.  But it's pretty close to the norm.\n* In my SD life, no condoms is also the norm.  It almost never even comes up in conversation.\n* The one time it was a deal breaker, I gave her a nice parting gift and left.  No \"pressure.\"\n* Except... and this is the problem... *you* seem to think that *my money is your right*.  \n\nI know my health; I'm not gambling with your life.  It is antagonistic for you to claim otherwise.  But I won't pressure you.  We just aren't compatible at that point.\n\nDo you believe that if I reject you for that, I'm \"pressuring\" you?  Isn't that self-entitled?\n\nDo you believe that no other SBs could possibly choose differently from you unless they're \"desperate\"?  (Your word.)   Isn't that misogynistic and patronizing?\n\nChalk it up to this: You have boundaries that eliminate a lot of the potential SD pool.  Fine.  Nobody is *forcing* you to play, unless *you* are the desperate one.  Perhaps try a different pool.",

Is it because Pot tries to negotiate around your boundaries? \n\nRecognize that many Pot SD's have been successful in business. And, in business everything is negotiable. And, in the end if there's no meeting of the minds then there's no agreement. Next.\n\nOr is there anger here because it's \"too easy\" for a SD to find a condom less arrangement thereby making your services less in demand? Therefore, you're going to devalue and question something that the market finds very valuable. \n\nEither way the protestations come off as whining.  Find arrangements that respect your boundaries. And don't judge others' boundaries.",

Whether my SBs have had relatively fewer sex partners or in the one case many more, their default seemed to be condom-less. Very infrequently I had to tell the very LT that I had recently had sex with a vanilla peer of mine (late fifties sort) but that didn\u2019t change the status quo at all.",
