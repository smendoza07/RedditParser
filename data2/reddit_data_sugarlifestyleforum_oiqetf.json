    "body": "**edit: holy moly some of the \u2728ultra super duper kinky\u2728 people in the comments (yes you are so special and kinky! don't worry! i see you!) are getting their panties in a real twist over my use of the term 'kink' so i'll clarify; some of the men messaging me are looking exclusively for a pillow princess, some want pussy worship only (as far as intimacy in the arrangement goes, so obviously involving d/s) as well as findom (paypig/princess) being incorporated - so yes, for them it factored into their kink! i'm so sorry to have summarised it and trigger so many of you lol. giving oral sex for the sake of giving oral sex is vanilla, yes we all know this, thank you and goodnight \u270c\ufe0f**\n\nsexual health is literally paramount to me. no amount of sugar is worth getting HIV or any other STD / STI. plenty of them can make women infertile, and women are really vulnerable when it comes to catching them from men. \n\nso how am i meant to protect myself, especially when all the POTs i seem to talk to have pussy eating as their #1 kink and that is primarily what they want to do?? how is there any trust? in normal relationships, it's accepted that the person loves you, cares for you, and wouldn't put you in harms way for all the tea in china. so there's an element of security. but that doesn't exist in the bowl. so many SRs are NSA and as far as i can see, SDs seem to feel no responsibility for keeping anyone safe, not even themselves. don't they care or is it just genuine ignorance?\n\ni ended it with yet another POT just today after he told me about some hot unprotected sex he had recently with another man, whilst still thinking that i was going to be down to enter into an arrangement with him. um, no?????? absolutely not. i told him he'll now have to wait for the 6 week incubation period to pass before he can get screened at the sexual health clinic, because HIV won't show up on blood test results until that period of time has lapsed. and he was like 'huh? no way!' \n\nhe said \"the guy seemed super clean, he was really nice and a professional\" and i just wanted to pull my hair out. another POT i ended things with insisted he \"only has unprotected sex if the girls look after themselves and care about their appearance\" like, HUH? you're kidding me, right? these are wealthy, educated, privileged adults, and yet they seem to have ZERO comprehension about keeping themselves (and future partners) safe. am i just having horrible, horrible luck??? \n\nhow do i weed out these SDs??? my inbox gets flooded on a daily basis with men looking to start an arrangement ASAP and none of them EVER ask if i've been screened or if i'm DDF. do i need to put it on my profile in black and white? **'do not message me unless you have a thorough understanding of sexual health and are proactive about keeping yourself disease free and safeguarding the sexual health of your partners'** ????\n\nseriously, i feel like i'm living on another plane of existence here. why isn't this glaringly obvious stuff??",

A vanilla guy has just as much potential to expose you to something as a POT SD, imho. But this is a big reason why I stick to mostly exclusive, traditional SR\u2019s. \n\nI typically avoid intimacy until the third date and I have started building a solid foundation of trust and an understanding of who the person is. If a POT SD can last 3 dates, they understand I\u2019m not an escort and (in my experience) the relationship has a lot more mutual respect than intimacy right after a M&G.\n\nUse protection and get tested regularly. If it\u2019s scaring you this bad I would maybe reconsider being in the bowl.",

Meaning, I tried dating a couple of vanilla partners closer to my age late summer of 2019, but I didn\u2019t feel it with either and haven\u2019t slept with any other but my SB since. Having sex with her 4-9 times a month just doesn\u2019t leave me with time or interest in pursuing anyone else. She had another partner too that summer, or anytime up to summer 2020, and caught chlamydia. I didn\u2019t get it, or got it and spontaneously cleared it. So imho, older SDs, as they report here, can sometimes be monogamous with SB, and SBs sometimes reciprocate on that, too. No way to evaluate your own situation except by having a straight talk, and even then there\u2019s a trust factor to be considered.",

What about if he is sterile?\"\n\nStuff like that. I do this because a lot of women will just say whatever they think I want to hear. You could try a similar tactic. It can backfire, especially if you imply the opposite of what you want, but in my experience that is rare.\n\nI also have a rule of 1 partner from seeking only. She will be the only girl I have sex with from the site and I will be the only guy she has sex with from the site. Non sugar sex is fine so long as everyone is safe (but I still prefer both of us keep our numbers down).\n\nAnother red flag to reduce risk is I avoid anyone that mentions that they're going on vacation to a city for a few days or a few weeks. That tells me she is looking for a short term thing with a guy or two while there which means she likely has been with a lot of guys on seeking.\n\nI'm similar about taking my sexual health seriously, so I hope this helps!",

Even the girls that just put when and where they are going on vacation  without a 2nd location are looking for a SD in that vacation spot in my experience. I used to message those girls and at some point I'd ask about it and almost every one said they were hoping to find someone while they were on vacation.\n\nFinding a good, longterm SD is hard. Finding a guy that wants to throw money at a girl for a quick lay is apparently pretty easy.\n\nI didn't say I avoid anyone that mentions a vacation. I said:\n\n> I avoid anyone that mentions that they're going on vacation to a city for a few days or a few weeks.\n\nThose qualifiers matter. Mentioning a time frame and a specific city along with the vacation are are red flags.",

Even if I read your profile and saw the statement you have in bold, I\u2019d assume you mean that we would use condoms for vaginal and anal until we\u2019re at the point of exchanging results (and after 6 weeks).   I would not expect you to want to wait that long to have unprotected oral sex, because that is *extremely* uncommon for people to want and I would expect you to be ok with vaginal/anal with condoms before the 6 week period, because yes that is what the vast majority of the adult population would do.  The odds of getting HIV from oral are minuscule and most people just don\u2019t worry about that risk just like they don\u2019t worry about a meteor falling on their head during sex.  \n\nIf you are so scared of STDs that you want a 6 week period since your partner has had sex with someone else, the bowl is probably not for you.",

Do what makes you feel comfortable.\n\nI feel like most people have gone so long without \"catching\" anything or anything permanent that they think they're a good judge of character of other people's sexual health. And/or they trust that people will be honest and disclose to them if they have anything. OR they have something themselves and they don't disclose so they're just gifting people without any regard for the other person's health.\n\nAlso, as someone who is gHSV2+ and has to deal with the stigma that surrounds this, it's not that I don't care or have been reckless with my sexual health. I trusted someone who did not give a fuck about my choice to choose whether to be with them or not. So yeah.\n\nHerpes is NOT included in the standard sti testing panel. You have to specifically request it and even then, the doctor still might not order the test because you need to currently be having a flare up. So a LOT of people are asymptomatic for herpes, but since they've never been tested for it, they think they're negative for everything when they're really not. Viral shedding still occurs when you are asymptomatic. So they're infecting people willy nilly and don't even know. So I actually know more about my sexual health and how to treat this and protect others better than those that asymptomatic and have never actually been tested for it.\n\nAlso, sidebar- for those that say they're \"clean,\" please try saying \"negative\" instead. Because inherently, the opposite is that others are dirty if you are clean. And that's fucked up. Anyway. I know that's gonna upset some ignorant person,.it always does. \ud83d\ude44\n\n*hops off soapbox*\nGood luck figuring out what to do, OP. \ud83d\ude42",

Transmission rates can vary but if you are sexually active in a non-monogamous relationship, you will get an STI. Even the ones that are curable can have lasting consequences, such as sterilization and impotence, and the ones that are incurable have life long consequences, from pain to drastically shorting your life expectancy. HIV is not a death sentence now but it still shortens your life expectancy by decades. Are you willing to risk giving up decades of life just because you don't want to use protection or wait a few weeks for proper testing?",

If anything it is the opposite. The kind of people that don't use protection in a SR where it's assumed the other person has other partners is not thinking about their sexual health. Maybe they get tested once a year at their doctors appointment?",

Having sex with her 4-9 times a month just doesn\u2019t leave me with time or interest in pursuing anyone else. She had another partner too that summer, or anytime up to summer 2020, and caught chlamydia. I didn\u2019t get it, or got it and spontaneously cleared it. So imho, older SDs, as they report here, can sometimes be monogamous with SB, and SBs sometimes reciprocate on that, too. No way to evaluate your own situation except by having a straight talk, and even then there\u2019s a trust factor to be considered.",

If you are hooking up with random guys, those random guys will be hooking up with other random women :-/ That's not a fair comparison though. A SR isn't meant to be a one off or just a few times. It's meant to be a relationship. \n\nHowever, a SR differs from a vanilla relationship in many ways. One of the most common is that almost all SRs are open while very few vanilla relationships are open.",

Looking for an SD is work and especially if they're going on a trip with family or friends they may not be looking for an SD at all.",

Even the girls that just put when and where they are going on vacation  without a 2nd location are looking for a SD in that vacation spot in my experience. I used to message those girls and at some point I'd ask about it and almost every one said they were hoping to find someone while they were on vacation.\n\nFinding a good, longterm SD is hard. Finding a guy that wants to throw money at a girl for a quick lay is apparently pretty easy.\n\nI didn't say I avoid anyone that mentions a vacation. I said:\n\n> I avoid anyone that mentions that they're going on vacation to a city for a few days or a few weeks.\n\nThose qualifiers matter. Mentioning a time frame and a specific city along with the vacation are are red flags.",

HIV is not a death sentence now but it still shortens your life expectancy by decades.

If someone is willing to have unprotected sex with me then they are willing to have unprotected sex with other people and as such are more likely to have an STD. \n\nI also completely disagree with their belief that someone that has unprotected sex is more likely to get tested regularly. If anything it is the opposite. The kind of people that don't use protection in a SR where it's assumed the other person has other partners is not thinking about their sexual health. Maybe they get tested once a year at their doctors appointment?",

She had another partner too that summer, or anytime up to summer 2020, and caught chlamydia. I didn\u2019t get it, or got it and spontaneously cleared it. So imho, older SDs, as they report here, can sometimes be monogamous with SB, and SBs sometimes reciprocate on that, too.

Even the girls that just put when and where they are going on vacation  without a 2nd location are looking for a SD in that vacation spot in my experience. I used to message those girls and at some point I'd ask about it and almost every one said they were hoping to find someone while they were on vacation.\n\nFinding a good, longterm SD is hard. Finding a guy that wants to throw money at a girl for a quick lay is apparently pretty easy.\n\nI didn't say I avoid anyone that mentions a vacation. I said:\n\n> I avoid anyone that mentions that they're going on vacation to a city for a few days or a few weeks.\n\nThose qualifiers matter. Mentioning a time frame and a specific city along with the vacation are are red flags.",

Even the ones that are curable can have lasting consequences, such as sterilization and impotence, and the ones that are incurable have life long consequences, from pain to drastically shorting your life expectancy. HIV is not a death sentence now but it still shortens your life expectancy by decades.

Meaning, I tried dating a couple of vanilla partners closer to my age late summer of 2019, but I didn\u2019t feel it with either and haven\u2019t slept with any other but my SB since. Having sex with her 4-9 times a month just doesn\u2019t leave me with time or interest in pursuing anyone else. She had another partner too that summer, or anytime up to summer 2020, and caught chlamydia. I didn\u2019t get it, or got it and spontaneously cleared it. So imho, older SDs, as they report here, can sometimes be monogamous with SB, and SBs sometimes reciprocate on that, too. No way to evaluate your own situation except by having a straight talk, and even then there\u2019s a trust factor to be considered.",

Meaning, I tried dating a couple of vanilla partners closer to my age late summer of 2019, but I didn\u2019t feel it with either and haven\u2019t slept with any other but my SB since. Having sex with her 4-9 times a month just doesn\u2019t leave me with time or interest in pursuing anyone else. She had another partner too that summer, or anytime up to summer 2020, and caught chlamydia. I didn\u2019t get it, or got it and spontaneously cleared it. So imho, older SDs, as they report here, can sometimes be monogamous with SB, and SBs sometimes reciprocate on that, too. No way to evaluate your own situation except by having a straight talk, and even then there\u2019s a trust factor to be considered.",

Meaning, I tried dating a couple of vanilla partners closer to my age late summer of 2019, but I didn\u2019t feel it with either and haven\u2019t slept with any other but my SB since. Having sex with her 4-9 times a month just doesn\u2019t leave me with time or interest in pursuing anyone else. She had another partner too that summer, or anytime up to summer 2020, and caught chlamydia. I didn\u2019t get it, or got it and spontaneously cleared it. So imho, older SDs, as they report here, can sometimes be monogamous with SB, and SBs sometimes reciprocate on that, too. No way to evaluate your own situation except by having a straight talk, and even then there\u2019s a trust factor to be considered.",

I think that os what they are rightly worried by, not by the chance of unknowingly have hiv\ud83d\ude44 not that I should have to explain any of that since it is quite obvious why they are worried.
