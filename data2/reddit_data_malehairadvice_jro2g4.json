I forget exactly what, but you need to click on something to get there. That will explain how to do it, and what to buy to begin with. \n\nI also agree that that cut would be great on you! Go for it. I will warn you,  once you start learning about how your curls work, you might just end up wearing it curly. Right now it will look short. It will grow, and if you keep it, you should get some nice ringlets! People will envy it, I am not joking either. Just scroll through that sub. -all my best!",

I'd actually recommend you stop shampooing and instead get yourself a cleansing conditioner or co-wash. You should also use a leave-in conditioner or curl cream. Don't avoid the \"ethnic\" haircare aisle at the store. That's actually where you should be looking. \n\nI've tried all the expensive brands that the chain hair salons try to push (hair stylists are typically required to sell a certain amount of product each month to keep their spot at the salon). My hair didn't improve until I did my own research and experimenting.",

Add width to your face by growing out the sides more :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that haircut would suit you, 100% agree with your girlfriend. Growing out the sides will allow less maintenance as well, the messy look is sometimes really attractive too :)",

I have had short, somewhat classical side-wave cut for the best of the last 7 years although I am rather lenient and usually let it grow quite a bit before getting a new cut.\n\nMiddle pic is the point at which I usually cut, pic 3 is where I am right now (fresh cut 3 weeks ago). I naturally have insanely dense and somehow curly hair, although for the purposes of my normal haircut I usually straighten it with a brush every day. \n\nNow I never really had a big hair care routine, which is the first thing I am starting doing now. Have bought a good quality shampoo for my hair style (not the 5 in one I used to have) as well a matching conditioner for when I'll have a bit of length. I'll also stop straightening it so my natural curl can come back.\n\nMy question is mostly: anything special you'd recommend doing in order to achieve the best result? Obviously the growing period will be somewhat messy and incomplete, but there is any styling trick to get it \"in place\" as it grows I'd be super thankful!",
