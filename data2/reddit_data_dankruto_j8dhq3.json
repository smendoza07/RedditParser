Rewatching it I see everything that happened and why he did it and im mad at myself for not catching on sooner.",

Just before he showed up, Sasuke was USING his body despite being in so much pain from his cursemark to protect Naruto. And he told Naruto that he was precious to him. Then when he found out Itachi was back, his reaction wasn't, I need to go get my revenge\" it was \"I have to save Naruto\"\n\nHe tortured Sasuke into insanity, and pushed him into the arms of Orochimaru. He created the Sasuke in Shippuden.\n\nItachi is supposed to be a smart guy, but didn't think that telling a child to live solely for revenge/hatred could backfire.\n\nOh, and his solution to Sasuke becoming a lunatic is MORE mindrape.",

Itachi was a first class master planner.\n\nHe let Orochimaru tangle with sasuke and give him more power so he can last in a fight against him, he poured hate in him so he could fight without holding back, he shouldered the responsibility of averting a civil war, kept the key to foil sage kabutos jutsu in Naruto etc.\n\nI think sasuke and Naruto are the most childish characters in the whole anime",

I've always been empathetic towards sasuke because what he went through mentally was horrible. \nMaybe Itachi could have saved sasuke from turning into a revenge hungry psychopath but I think he himself faced so much trauma.",

He also wonders if maybe, given the right chance, they could've worked out something more peaceful. Then Itachi has to kill him. Very sad",

Itachi was a first class master planner.\n\nHe let Orochimaru tangle with sasuke and give him more power so he can last in a fight against him, he poured hate in him so he could fight without holding back, he shouldered the responsibility of averting a civil war, kept the key to foil sage kabutos jutsu in Naruto etc.\n\nI think sasuke and Naruto are the most childish characters in the whole anime",

Itachi was a first class master planner.\n\nHe let Orochimaru tangle with sasuke and give him more power so he can last in a fight against him, he poured hate in him so he could fight without holding back, he shouldered the responsibility of averting a civil war, kept the key to foil sage kabutos jutsu in Naruto etc.\n\nI think sasuke and Naruto are the most childish characters in the whole anime",

Itachi was a first class master planner.\n\nHe let Orochimaru tangle with sasuke and give him more power so he can last in a fight against him, he poured hate in him so he could fight without holding back, he shouldered the responsibility of averting a civil war, kept the key to foil sage kabutos jutsu in Naruto etc.\n\nI think sasuke and Naruto are the most childish characters in the whole anime",

The Leaf were planning to destroy the Uchiha and the Uchiha were planning a coup very quickly. If Itachi didn't barter with them and let him do it to save Sasuke the Leaf would've sent in relentless Anbu members and caused a complete slaughtering. \n\nI always think about the flashback of Itachi's where it shows him talking to his father before killing him, and how he regrets it had to come to this. He also wonders if maybe, given the right chance, they could've worked out something more peaceful. Then Itachi has to kill him. Very sad",
