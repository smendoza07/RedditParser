Maybe about 2 inches on top and 3/4 of an inch on the sides. Then use a clay with a strong hold. I used to use Claymation, but I use Templeton Tonic\u2019s Oasis clay now (much stronger hold, so thanks /r/pomade for the recommendation). It helps to blow dry your hair after the shower (especially with a prestyler like Original Blumaan), and then put in the clay once it\u2019s dry. I typically don\u2019t do that and just put clay in my hair when it\u2019s slightly damp. And I use a Conair barrel brush. Feel free to ask me any questions. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of hate for measurements, so I\u2019ll try to offer better advice. I just guesstimated what I *(me)* typically do. Perhaps try 1-1 and 1/2 inches on the sides and about 2 and 1/2 inches on top. See how that works for you. If you get your clay holding and it works fine for you, then you can have your barber not cut as short next time.",

This can help you tame any errant hairs, keep the sides down, tidy up the back. Be sparing, you don't want to have a stark contrast from top to sides. \n\nMaintenance? Tidy up the facial hair, tidy up the eye brows, go to the gym, visit /r/skincareaddiction, and hope to christ you have a good chin.\n\nGood luck OP.",
