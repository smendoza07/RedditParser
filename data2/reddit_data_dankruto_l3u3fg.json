He was forced to use his Mangekyo far more than Itachi ever needed to, as shown when he went blind in the course of that whole debacle. It took Itachi *years* to use his eyes that much.\n\nWe can clearly see the difference in fighting style between Itachi and Sasuke. Itachi is careful, clever, level headed and meticulous. He uses his Mangekyo to augment his already impressive abilities. Sasuke used his Mangekyo as a crutch to make up for the power gap between him and the people he was fighting. He had no business trying to fight the Raikage at that point in the story and had to use the Susanoo in combination with Amaterasu/Kagetsuchi to withstand his overwhelming speed and attacks.\n\nThis is a very long winded way to say that I agree.",

Plus he was able to use a tandem paper bomb to destroy on of Hashiramas Deity Gates, which had withstood an attack from the Ten Tails with only minor damage.\n\nMinato is no contest, because of obvious reasons.

I don't think any other Hokage healed as many people as Tsunade did. If it weren't for her and Shizune (her student), Lee would have never been a ninja again & Choji and Neji would have died after Sasuke Retrieval arc. In fact, Naruto would have died when Kabuto severed his heart's chakra network. \n\nMy point is, while she might have been the \"weakest\" in terms of combat jutsu, she was still a dope ass hokage who did things for the sake of the village that none of the other Hokages could have done.",

His fights with Kakashi and Orochimaru were classic sharingan \"I look at you and you're dead\", pure brute force with no strategy at all. Kakashi wasn't even kage level at the time. And he ran from Jiraiya, cannot believe his fanboys are pretending he fought him. His fire style and shuriken jutsu are not staples of his fighting style the way sword fighting is with Sasuke's and Sasuke also uses both those techniques.\n\nI don't like Sasuke as a character but you all do the most with him.

He had many supports including Itachi's powers and Mangekyu which he wasn't supposed to have if Itachi had already destroyed him.\nWhich also means he would be lacking so many things including Susano that saved his ass at one point of time.\n\n\n2. Danzo was holding back and wasn't going 100% at Sasuke. Probably the most important point. Danzo clearly mentions this in the beginning of the fight that he will first kill Sasuke and then kill Madara(>!Obito!<) too. He clearly considered Madara being lot stronger than Sasuke and was saving Kotoamatsukami for him so he couldn't have gone unloaded 100% of his potential on Sasuke.\n\n\n3. Danzo was an old geezer who hadn't fought in years while Sasuke was a teenage who did nothing but fighting and battling with peeps all the time. Shit wasn't fair.\n\n\n4. Despite all the biasing it would have ended in a draw if Obito hadn't alerted Sasuke ahead of time and made him flee the scene when Danzo activated Reverse 4 tetragram seal in the end.\n\nThere are more points that I might be missing here as it has been years since I finished Naruto, but please shove that low effort comment in your ass before posting here. Yeah, sorry for being rude, but people can't get this shit straight.\n\n\n5. He had help from Karin 1vsX",

He had many supports including Itachi's powers and Mangekyu which he wasn't supposed to have if Itachi had already destroyed him.\nWhich also means he would be lacking so many things including Susano that saved his ass at one point of time.\n\n\n2. Danzo was holding back and wasn't going 100% at Sasuke. Probably the most important point. Danzo clearly mentions this in the beginning of the fight that he will first kill Sasuke and then kill Madara(>!Obito!<) too. He clearly considered Madara being lot stronger than Sasuke and was saving Kotoamatsukami for him so he couldn't have gone unloaded 100% of his potential on Sasuke.\n\n\n3. Danzo was an old geezer who hadn't fought in years while Sasuke was a teenage who did nothing but fighting and battling with peeps all the time. Shit wasn't fair.\n\n\n4. Despite all the biasing it would have ended in a draw if Obito hadn't alerted Sasuke ahead of time and made him flee the scene when Danzo activated Reverse 4 tetragram seal in the end.\n\nThere are more points that I might be missing here as it has been years since I finished Naruto, but please shove that low effort comment in your ass before posting here. Yeah, sorry for being rude, but people can't get this shit straight.",

The same edo madara tanked a massive sage mode rasen shuriken and barely got scratched. Also the adamantine staff is hard as a diamond and diamonds are nowhere near tough enough to survive a rasen shuriken.\nHiruzens speed is on the level of or slower than massively weakened edo hashirama. Tsunade actually tagged edo madara who's near his true strength several times and even destroyed his body when she hit it. She's faster, stronger and more durable than Hiruzen can even wish to be. \n\n\n\n\nAnd who else can Hiruzen even politely ask to fight?

Part 1 edo hashirama could literally only make few trees when shippuden edo hashirama could go into sage mode and use his wood golem which was strong enough to go 1v1 with perfect susanoo and wood dragon that can tame the 9 tails by itself. Oh and diety gates which could immobilize the 10 tails. You see the difference? Few trees<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< sage mode, golem, wood dragon, diety gates, wood clones. And Hiruzen was the only one doing something against guru guru? Last time i checked everyone was still beaten up from the madara fight and all Hiruzen did was use shadow clones with some fodder elemental jutsu. Then Karin one shotted the statue so basically Karin > edo Hiruzen.\n\n\n\n\nTsunade is strong enough to one shot Hiruzen, fast enough to blitz or overwhelm him and durable enough+has enough regeneration to the point where Hiruzen literally physically can't harm her. Oh and madara only let 1 attack hit him and that's the ohnoki one. He was blocking and dodging everything else. And he didn't let night guy hit him. He tried to use his tso staff but the space bent and he got blitzed.",

And part 1 tsunade couldn't use Byakugou to boost her stats like shippuden meaning shippuden tsunade should be massively faster.\n\nAll that aside, Hiruzen has literally nothing to harm or kill her and weak stamina so even if he just tried to do anything he'll just waste his stamina and die of exhaustion. \n\n\nAnd madara clearly struggled to keep up with 8g guy the entire time + had several of his TSO either teleported away, kamuied or destroyed.

He says it like 3 seconds after hashirama summons few trees.\n\n\n\n\"We'll just go ahead and remember you just actually used this sentance: \"Stop taking it out of context.\" WOW. You. You just said that. Anyways. He's toying with them so yeah he is only dodging the easier attacks, but that's like when youre lying on a couch while playing a video game.

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here. Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed. Or the other dude Tsunade, like the moron she is poisoned, and can therefor no longer controll his chakra correctly. Btw just a sidenote why is Tsunade even Hokage she's fucking dumb. \"\n\nYes. Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands. She was, for a moment about to fuckin, pass out.

The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru.

So according to your logic sage mode jiraya >>> adult 6 paths Naruto. Oooooor we will notice that same as Hinata has no idea about how strong jiraya actually was Iruka has no idea about prime Hiruzen, hashirama or tobirama as well and both of their statements are completely irrelevant.\n\n\nMeanwhile tsunade actually has feats that support her winning.",

There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine.

His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him.

I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \"\n\n\nNo, considering databooks are Canon I'm using them to back up my facts. I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

I'd say it's quite fitting here too.\n\nHe stood up against the demon brothers while Naruto cried. He fought haku while Naruto was unconscious and lost bcs he had to protect Naruto. He fought orochimaru in the death forest and was doing rly well. He beat the shit out of the oto nin. He almost beat gaara who at the time was a lot stronger than any other genins and lost bcs of the cursemark. And in the end of pt 1 he beat Naruto. \n\nIn shippuden he beat yamato. Killed off orochimaru who may have been sick but tf is he supposed to do give him his body? He beat Deidera, who may have killed himself but so did 99% of the villains Naruto fought. He beat killer bee (with help ofc but killer bee was a lot stronger than even Naruto at that point). He fought the 5 kage and did pretty good and instantly after that killed danzo who was one Hokage. Only to then stand off against team 7. All without one break. He then rejoined in the war, beat kabuto without wanting to kill him and helped almost beat Madara and beat kaguya. Only to fight for days with Naruto directly after. \n\nNaruto did what? Got banged by the demon brothers. Haku killed herself, Zabuza killed himself, almost lost against kiva, should've lost against neko(won bcs of plot armor) had help from the giant toad and still almost lost to gaara who was weakened and didn't even kill him, got fucked by kabuto and orochimaru, then got fucked up by kimimaru followed by his loss against sasuke.\n\nIn shippuden he didn't manage to kill Deidera, didn't manage to get sasuke back, finished off a weakened kakuzu, would've lost multiple times against both pain and Nagato, who just didn't want to kill him and in the end commited suicide, lost against tobi, died against Madara and in the end finally managed to kill kaguya with sasuke. \n\nSasuke did a ton more in a lot less screentime do your maths people, or you'll end up like OP.",

But I guess the reason it is different to me, is that Naruto never had anyone to teach him. And it took him so long to get any kind of recognition or positive attention. Whereas Sasuke had a lot of people actively trying to reach out and help him. He was always the best in the class. They humanize him a lot more in flashbacks and filler in Shippuden, and you understand a lot more of the story, but I felt like he was always so mean and grumpy to people because they treated him the way Naruto wished he was treated.",

Sasuke was shy/introverted before the massacre. He never liked the attention he got for being an Uchiha before the massacre, why would he like it after? I don't see how he was meaner than the other kids his age, when he just wanted to be left alone for the most part. And canon does a pretty great job of humanizing Sasuke's character. He suffers survivors guilt and PTSD from watching his family be murdered. \n\nthat's why his attachment to naruto makes sense. naruto didn't care that he was an uchiha.",

Of course he couldn't and thats how Sasuke was able to defeat him\n\nIn that moment, Sasuke also let Danzo stab him because he knew he had Karin to heal him. So yea Sasuke would've needed Karin several times over, not only to sense Danzo, and to restore his chakra, but also so he could use her for his last little trick there against Danzo. \n\nNot to say that it wasn't all brilliant, it was his idea to recruit her in the first place, I'm just saying he was far from ready to go through that alone.",

On one end of the spectrum we have Tsunade, who is no slouch but also isn't *Naruto Uzumaki*.\n\nSasuke is undeniably very strong, but is also a glass cannon in that part of the story. He was forced to use his Mangekyo far more than Itachi ever needed to, as shown when he went blind in the course of that whole debacle. It took Itachi *years* to use his eyes that much.\n\nWe can clearly see the difference in fighting style between Itachi and Sasuke. Itachi is careful, clever, level headed and meticulous. He uses his Mangekyo to augment his already impressive abilities. Sasuke used his Mangekyo as a crutch to make up for the power gap between him and the people he was fighting. He had no business trying to fight the Raikage at that point in the story and had to use the Susanoo in combination with Amaterasu/Kagetsuchi to withstand his overwhelming speed and attacks.\n\nThis is a very long winded way to say that I agree.",

Plus he was able to use a tandem paper bomb to destroy on of Hashiramas Deity Gates, which had withstood an attack from the Ten Tails with only minor damage.\n\nMinato is no contest, because of obvious reasons.

His fights with Kakashi and Orochimaru were classic sharingan \"I look at you and you're dead\", pure brute force with no strategy at all. Kakashi wasn't even kage level at the time. And he ran from Jiraiya, cannot believe his fanboys are pretending he fought him. His fire style and shuriken jutsu are not staples of his fighting style the way sword fighting is with Sasuke's and Sasuke also uses both those techniques.\n\nI don't like Sasuke as a character but you all do the most with him. Kirin alone shows more strategy and innovation than Itachi's entire arsenal.",

Deidara fight made him more full of himself if anything. \nRemember he still went right after to fight Itachi thinking he could win, Killer Bee, attacked the Kage summit, Danzo, talking down to Kakashi. That boy didn't get humbled until Naruto whooped his ass at the end. Madara probably humbled him a bit too.",

The same edo madara tanked a massive sage mode rasen shuriken and barely got scratched. Also the adamantine staff is hard as a diamond and diamonds are nowhere near tough enough to survive a rasen shuriken.\nHiruzens speed is on the level of or slower than massively weakened edo hashirama. Tsunade actually tagged edo madara who's near his true strength several times and even destroyed his body when she hit it. She's faster, stronger and more durable than Hiruzen can even wish to be. \n\n\n\n\nAnd who else can Hiruzen even politely ask to fight?

Part 1 edo hashirama could literally only make few trees when shippuden edo hashirama could go into sage mode and use his wood golem which was strong enough to go 1v1 with perfect susanoo and wood dragon that can tame the 9 tails by itself. Oh and diety gates which could immobilize the 10 tails. You see the difference? Few trees<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< sage mode, golem, wood dragon, diety gates, wood clones. And Hiruzen was the only one doing something against guru guru? Last time i checked everyone was still beaten up from the madara fight and all Hiruzen did was use shadow clones with some fodder elemental jutsu. Then Karin one shotted the statue so basically Karin > edo Hiruzen.\n\n\n\n\nTsunade is strong enough to one shot Hiruzen, fast enough to blitz or overwhelm him and durable enough+has enough regeneration to the point where Hiruzen literally physically can't harm her. Oh and madara only let 1 attack hit him and that's the ohnoki one. He was blocking and dodging everything else. And he didn't let night guy hit him. He tried to use his tso staff but the space bent and he got blitzed.",

And part 1 tsunade couldn't use Byakugou to boost her stats like shippuden meaning shippuden tsunade should be massively faster.\n\nAll that aside, Hiruzen has literally nothing to harm or kill her and weak stamina so even if he just tried to do anything he'll just waste his stamina and die of exhaustion. \n\n\nAnd madara clearly struggled to keep up with 8g guy the entire time + had several of his TSO either teleported away, kamuied or destroyed.

If he were to actually try, they'd land like no hits. \n\"The same orochimaru was capable of tagging jiraya and even tsunade before.\" \nFirst of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :) \n\"And mind you this is already fatigued tsunade from the previous healing, summoning, fighting etc.\" Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here.

A 16 yr old child may I add. And he was able to adapt. Since.. you know.. he's kind of smart and all, which we sadly can't say about Tsunade. And then WOW she won.

He says it like 3 seconds after hashirama summons few trees.\n\n\n\n\"We'll just go ahead and remember you just actually used this sentance: \"Stop taking it out of context.\" WOW. You. You just said that. Anyways. He's toying with them so yeah he is only dodging the easier attacks, but that's like when youre lying on a couch while playing a video game.

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here. Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed. Or the other dude Tsunade, like the moron she is poisoned, and can therefor no longer controll his chakra correctly. Btw just a sidenote why is Tsunade even Hokage she's fucking dumb. \"\n\nYes. Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands. She was, for a moment about to fuckin, pass out.

The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

Hiruzen himself literally died. Hiruzen even says it's unfortunate that he can't take orochimaru with him as he's dying.\"\nThat was in the end after endless amounts of Enma to convince him and even there he was struggling to follow through with it. I'm starting to wonder as to whether you even payed attention in the slightest. \n\"And Hiruzen is a part 1 character meaning he's weaker than others. Him being a pre-power creep character is an EXPLANATION not and EXCUSE for how weak he is.\" \nI get where you come from as that would technically mean he'd be worse. But the timeskip didn't just make the new characters stronger. Everyone got stronger kinda percentage-wise. He was in pt.1 considered the strongest hokage at a point. (Althought I'd say that's bs.) That means he would still be strong in shippuden. Just as kakashi and Jiraya became a lot stronger in Shippuden without any training or antything. F.e. Kakashi in pt 1 was fighting Zabuza and rly didn't have too big of an arsenal of jutsus and was kinda slow, where as in shippuden with nearly no training he was spamming shit left and right, including raikiri, which at the start was quite the OP jutsu and with nearly no training hes just spamming that shi-. \nSo I'd say the power creep doesn't make the characters from pt 1 worse since they're percentage wise the same strength as they were before. Although I can understand you better now. \nTo further clarify what I mean though, if you look at Hiruzen vs Orochimaru, which by Shippuden standards would be a Jonin fight at best, was considered a Kage level battle by bystanding Anbu-Elite members. These same members are able to summon summonings 4 times Hiruzen v Orochimaru-fight summonings with ease. I doubt they learned that in the time skip. I hope that makes it clear.\n\"Edo Hiruzen literally tried using shuriken on obito and then used 4 elemental jutsu. If he had something stronger he would have used it. He was weak even in shippuden, post power creep without the problems caused by age. \"\nHe was regening his body for half the fight. The reason why he was gone so long is because this fight was supposed to concentrate on the Hokage we hadn't seen before. To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous. He is said to have mastered every konoha jutsu excluding kekkei genkai. The problems that come with age haven't all left. He is in his old body incapable of a lot, he was able to do when younger. Althogh I don't get why he is in old form since Madara was revived young. \n\"\"Hiruzen never had the intent to kill\" meanwhile Hiruzen using an instant death jutsu saying how he'll kill orochimaru\" I literally say this every few seconds, Enma had to try to convince him and the whole time Hiruzen was battling himself inside trying to find a solution, since he did not want to kill him at first. And I hate to repeat myself, but that was the point of the whole thing. Enma talkin to him, having to protect him, Hiruzen getting ready to die rather than kill his former student, him having flashbacks, Enma convincing him, him seeing his former mentors revived trying to kill him, his heart was broken and so was his will, but in the end he was able to come to terms with it, and with his old senile body and after being exhausted, managed to while blind seal 2 kage souls and nearly orochimaru, even tho he had kusaganagi stuck in him, which btw is fuckin OP. \n\nAgain, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...\nAlso, since I have a life I am unable to respond to you all too quickly, so if you want your facts a bit quicker I'd recommend videos from Swagkage or SethTheProgrammer.

And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each).

That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru.

Tsunade has better feats and better stats. She wins by default because the Canon gave her waaaaayyyy better feats and the literal only thing Hiruzen has is a statement made by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. For comparison, in boruto hinata said jiraya may be stronger than adult Naruto and Sasuke. Hinata was talking about base jiraya here. So according to your logic sage mode jiraya >>> adult 6 paths Naruto. Oooooor we will notice that same as Hinata has no idea about how strong jiraya actually was Iruka has no idea about prime Hiruzen, hashirama or tobirama as well and both of their statements are completely irrelevant.\n\n\nMeanwhile tsunade actually has feats that support her winning.",

There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine.

His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out.

I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him.

So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway.

Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this.

I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed.

And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys.

They became rivals - and competed together. Sasuke giving Naruto his food is the reason they weren't sent back to the Academy. Sasuke also protected Naruto from the Demon brothers, checked on him, helped him walk home, sacrificed himself against Haku, was willing to sacrifice himself against Gaara. Plus, seeing that someone else was in a similar situation (no family) was comforting to Naruto. Sasuke acknowledged Naruto as a worthy opponent before anyone else did. \n\nTbh, Naruto likely has mental issues considering his backstory.",

I know they were starting to have him warm up right before the curse mark thing, but it was too little too late and he went from asshole, to slightly less of an asshole, to monumental asshole, and then it just goes downhill from there lol. I would have loved to seen more character development from him that wasn't just him being used by all of the bad guys and then realizing that at the last minute and suddenly swooping in to save the day..... just to go right back to being the asshole lol.",

But I guess the reason it is different to me, is that Naruto never had anyone to teach him. And it took him so long to get any kind of recognition or positive attention. Whereas Sasuke had a lot of people actively trying to reach out and help him. He was always the best in the class.

Sasuke was shy/introverted before the massacre. He never liked the attention he got for being an Uchiha before the massacre, why would he like it after? I don't see how he was meaner than the other kids his age, when he just wanted to be left alone for the most part. And canon does a pretty great job of humanizing Sasuke's character. He suffers survivors guilt and PTSD from watching his family be murdered. \n\nthat's why his attachment to naruto makes sense. naruto didn't care that he was an uchiha.",

Of course he couldn't and thats how Sasuke was able to defeat him\n\nIn that moment, Sasuke also let Danzo stab him because he knew he had Karin to heal him. So yea Sasuke would've needed Karin several times over, not only to sense Danzo, and to restore his chakra, but also so he could use her for his last little trick there against Danzo. \n\nNot to say that it wasn't all brilliant, it was his idea to recruit her in the first place, I'm just saying he was far from ready to go through that alone.",

He was forced to use his Mangekyo far more than Itachi ever needed to, as shown when he went blind in the course of that whole debacle. It took Itachi *years* to use his eyes that much.\n\nWe can clearly see the difference in fighting style between Itachi and Sasuke. Itachi is careful, clever, level headed and meticulous. He uses his Mangekyo to augment his already impressive abilities. Sasuke used his Mangekyo as a crutch to make up for the power gap between him and the people he was fighting. He had no business trying to fight the Raikage at that point in the story and had to use the Susanoo in combination with Amaterasu/Kagetsuchi to withstand his overwhelming speed and attacks.\n\nThis is a very long winded way to say that I agree.",

Pit her against any of the other Hokage(again, besides Kakashi) and she loses. How badly she loses depends on which one, because she could probably give old Hiruzen a run for his money, but other than that all the others just steamroll her.\n\nTobirama has a speed and reaction feat better than EMS Sasuke, when he dodges an attack from Sage Mode alive Madara. Plus he was able to use a tandem paper bomb to destroy on of Hashiramas Deity Gates, which had withstood an attack from the Ten Tails with only minor damage.\n\nMinato is no contest, because of obvious reasons. He's a Perfect Sage and has speed feats that dwarf even KCM2 + Sage Naruto.\n\nHashirama and Naruto are pretty self explanatory.",

His fights with Kakashi and Orochimaru were classic sharingan \"I look at you and you're dead\", pure brute force with no strategy at all. Kakashi wasn't even kage level at the time.

Also the adamantine staff is hard as a diamond and diamonds are nowhere near tough enough to survive a rasen shuriken.\nHiruzens speed is on the level of or slower than massively weakened edo hashirama. Tsunade actually tagged edo madara who's near his true strength several times and even destroyed his body when she hit it. She's faster, stronger and more durable than Hiruzen can even wish to be. \n\n\n\n\nAnd who else can Hiruzen even politely ask to fight?

Tsunades kick could even crack a susanoo and her punch cracked a ribcage. Also wtf lmaooooooo shippuden edo hashirama is like billion times stronger than part 1 edo hashirama. Part 1 edo hashirama could literally only make few trees when shippuden edo hashirama could go into sage mode and use his wood golem which was strong enough to go 1v1 with perfect susanoo and wood dragon that can tame the 9 tails by itself. Oh and diety gates which could immobilize the 10 tails. You see the difference? Few trees<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< sage mode, golem, wood dragon, diety gates, wood clones. And Hiruzen was the only one doing something against guru guru? Last time i checked everyone was still beaten up from the madara fight and all Hiruzen did was use shadow clones with some fodder elemental jutsu. Then Karin one shotted the statue so basically Karin > edo Hiruzen.\n\n\n\n\nTsunade is strong enough to one shot Hiruzen, fast enough to blitz or overwhelm him and durable enough+has enough regeneration to the point where Hiruzen literally physically can't harm her. Oh and madara only let 1 attack hit him and that's the ohnoki one. He was blocking and dodging everything else. And he didn't let night guy hit him.

And part 1 tsunade couldn't use Byakugou to boost her stats like shippuden meaning shippuden tsunade should be massively faster.\n\nAll that aside, Hiruzen has literally nothing to harm or kill her and weak stamina so even if he just tried to do anything he'll just waste his stamina and die of exhaustion. \n\n\nAnd madara clearly struggled to keep up with 8g guy the entire time + had several of his TSO either teleported away, kamuied or destroyed.

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him.

It's almost sad. \"\n\n\nYes the time he\"[Kabuto popped in a Chakra pill to boost himself when tsunade was out of breath before they even began ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/006-71.jpg)\n\n[he landed 1 hit and then immediately got cucked anyway ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/013-71.jpg)\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes of course he used her weakness against her. The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

I hope that makes it clear.\n\n\n\nYou know why characters got stronger? Because they trained for 3 fucking years. Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\n\n\n\"To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous. He is said to have mastered every konoha jutsu excluding kekkei genkai. The problems that come with age haven't all left. He is in his old body incapable of a lot, he was able to do when younger. Althogh I don't get why he is in old form since Madara was revived young. \"\n\n\n\nNo it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru. Meanwhile Hiruzen just tried to use an instakill technique but was too weak to pull it off and died alone instead.\n\n\n\n\"Again, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...

Tsunade has better feats and better stats. She wins by default because the Canon gave her waaaaayyyy better feats and the literal only thing Hiruzen has is a statement made by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. For comparison, in boruto hinata said jiraya may be stronger than adult Naruto and Sasuke. Hinata was talking about base jiraya here. So according to your logic sage mode jiraya >>> adult 6 paths Naruto. Oooooor we will notice that same as Hinata has no idea about how strong jiraya actually was Iruka has no idea about prime Hiruzen, hashirama or tobirama as well and both of their statements are completely irrelevant.\n\n\nMeanwhile tsunade actually has feats that support her winning.",

Stop making shit up Hiruzen literally used q suicide technique that he wanted to kill orochimaru with.\"\nYou know- for a moment- a slight timeframe like 5 comments ago, I thought I'd find myself a civilized discussion over a, to me blatantly obvious, matter. There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine. But completely ignoring a simple fact that only weakens your side slightly, is just inhuman. This is ridiculous behaviour. And it makes me wonder why I even argue.\n\n\"and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\"\nThat is indeed also one of my bigger problems with Hiruzen. His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \n\n\"You know why characters got stronger? Because they trained for 3 fucking years. Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\"\nNo shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \n\n\"No it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\"\nIt's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight. \n\n\"even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal\" \nI legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \n\n\"Swagkage and Seth are honestly fucking Retarded. And Seth is cocky af on top. They are the same people who see Naruto get KOed by a bijuu bomb>level attack and say he could solo Kaguya.\"\nLove the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all.

Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock.

Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this.

Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke.

I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed.

I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

I watched it for the first time in middle school, but rewatched it as an adult. And the second time, it was hard to watch because of how annoying Naruto was. But I guess the reason it is different to me, is that Naruto never had anyone to teach him. And it took him so long to get any kind of recognition or positive attention. Whereas Sasuke had a lot of people actively trying to reach out and help him. He was always the best in the class. They humanize him a lot more in flashbacks and filler in Shippuden, and you understand a lot more of the story, but I felt like he was always so mean and grumpy to people because they treated him the way Naruto wished he was treated.",

Sasuke was shy/introverted before the massacre. He never liked the attention he got for being an Uchiha before the massacre, why would he like it after? I don't see how he was meaner than the other kids his age, when he just wanted to be left alone for the most part. And canon does a pretty great job of humanizing Sasuke's character. He suffers survivors guilt and PTSD from watching his family be murdered. \n\nthat's why his attachment to naruto makes sense. naruto didn't care that he was an uchiha.",

Of course he couldn't and thats how Sasuke was able to defeat him\n\nIn that moment, Sasuke also let Danzo stab him because he knew he had Karin to heal him. So yea Sasuke would've needed Karin several times over, not only to sense Danzo, and to restore his chakra, but also so he could use her for his last little trick there against Danzo. \n\nNot to say that it wasn't all brilliant, it was his idea to recruit her in the first place, I'm just saying he was far from ready to go through that alone.",

Plus he was able to use a tandem paper bomb to destroy on of Hashiramas Deity Gates, which had withstood an attack from the Ten Tails with only minor damage.\n\nMinato is no contest, because of obvious reasons.

His fights with Kakashi and Orochimaru were classic sharingan \"I look at you and you're dead\", pure brute force with no strategy at all. Kakashi wasn't even kage level at the time. And he ran from Jiraiya, cannot believe his fanboys are pretending he fought him. His fire style and shuriken jutsu are not staples of his fighting style the way sword fighting is with Sasuke's and Sasuke also uses both those techniques.\n\nI don't like Sasuke as a character but you all do the most with him. Kirin alone shows more strategy and innovation than Itachi's entire arsenal.",

The same edo madara tanked a massive sage mode rasen shuriken and barely got scratched. Also the adamantine staff is hard as a diamond and diamonds are nowhere near tough enough to survive a rasen shuriken.\nHiruzens speed is on the level of or slower than massively weakened edo hashirama. Tsunade actually tagged edo madara who's near his true strength several times and even destroyed his body when she hit it. She's faster, stronger and more durable than Hiruzen can even wish to be. \n\n\n\n\nAnd who else can Hiruzen even politely ask to fight?

He still can use his neck, sword (which he already hit her with several times) and both feet. And to dodge an attack like that you don't need hands. Actually HOW WOULD THE HANDS EVEN HELP? He can't block the punches or she'll demolish the hands so and the entirety of his body except them was fully capable of dodging, yet he didn't. And mind you this is already fatigued tsunade from the previous healing, summoning, fighting etc.\n\n\n\"Fuckin kabuto is faster than that fat bitch tf do u mean\"\n\n\nKabuto got cucked by fatigued part 1 base tsunade despite eating a food pill to enhance his stats. He only had a chance when he used her fear of blood against her like a little pussy (which she overcome in the same battle).\n\n\nBoth, Databook and feats puts her speed above Hiruzen (in base). And feats put her speed waaaaayyyy above Hiruzen. The only thing Hiruzen actually has going for him is Irukas words about waaaaayyyy younger Hiruzen and 2 other people Iruka wasn't even alive to see.\n\n\nFeats and databooks >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Irukas words about a rumor (yes he didn't even say it for sure it's even by his words a rumor) that happened during the time he wasn't alive.",

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here.

Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands.

The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

I'm starting to wonder as to whether you even payed attention in the slightest. \n\"And Hiruzen is a part 1 character meaning he's weaker than others. Him being a pre-power creep character is an EXPLANATION not and EXCUSE for how weak he is.\" \nI get where you come from as that would technically mean he'd be worse. But the timeskip didn't just make the new characters stronger. Everyone got stronger kinda percentage-wise. He was in pt.1 considered the strongest hokage at a point. (Althought I'd say that's bs.) That means he would still be strong in shippuden. Just as kakashi and Jiraya became a lot stronger in Shippuden without any training or antything. F.e. Kakashi in pt 1 was fighting Zabuza and rly didn't have too big of an arsenal of jutsus and was kinda slow, where as in shippuden with nearly no training he was spamming shit left and right, including raikiri, which at the start was quite the OP jutsu and with nearly no training hes just spamming that shi-. \nSo I'd say the power creep doesn't make the characters from pt 1 worse since they're percentage wise the same strength as they were before. Although I can understand you better now. \nTo further clarify what I mean though, if you look at Hiruzen vs Orochimaru, which by Shippuden standards would be a Jonin fight at best, was considered a Kage level battle by bystanding Anbu-Elite members.

He was weak even in shippuden, post power creep without the problems caused by age. \"\nHe was regening his body for half the fight. The reason why he was gone so long is because this fight was supposed to concentrate on the Hokage we hadn't seen before. To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous. He is said to have mastered every konoha jutsu excluding kekkei genkai. The problems that come with age haven't all left. He is in his old body incapable of a lot, he was able to do when younger. Althogh I don't get why he is in old form since Madara was revived young. \n\"\"Hiruzen never had the intent to kill\" meanwhile Hiruzen using an instant death jutsu saying how he'll kill orochimaru\" I literally say this every few seconds, Enma had to try to convince him and the whole time Hiruzen was battling himself inside trying to find a solution, since he did not want to kill him at first. And I hate to repeat myself, but that was the point of the whole thing. Enma talkin to him, having to protect him, Hiruzen getting ready to die rather than kill his former student, him having flashbacks, Enma convincing him, him seeing his former mentors revived trying to kill him, his heart was broken and so was his will, but in the end he was able to come to terms with it, and with his old senile body and after being exhausted, managed to while blind seal 2 kage souls and nearly orochimaru, even tho he had kusaganagi stuck in him, which btw is fuckin OP. \n\nAgain, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...\nAlso, since I have a life I am unable to respond to you all too quickly, so if you want your facts a bit quicker I'd recommend videos from Swagkage or SethTheProgrammer.

He never said he isn't trying to kill orochimaru and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\n\n\n\nI get where you come from as that would technically mean he'd be worse. But the timeskip didn't just make the new characters stronger. Everyone got stronger kinda percentage-wise. He was in pt.1 considered the strongest hokage at a point. (Althought I'd say that's bs.) That means he would still be strong in shippuden. Just as kakashi and Jiraya became a lot stronger in Shippuden without any training or antything. F.e. Kakashi in pt 1 was fighting Zabuza and rly didn't have too big of an arsenal of jutsus and was kinda slow, where as in shippuden with nearly no training he was spamming shit left and right, including raikiri, which at the start was quite the OP jutsu and with nearly no training hes just spamming that shi-.

I hope that makes it clear.\n\n\n\nYou know why characters got stronger? Because they trained for 3 fucking years. Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\n\n\n\"To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous.

Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru. Meanwhile Hiruzen just tried to use an instakill technique but was too weak to pull it off and died alone instead.\n\n\n\n\"Again, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...

Tsunade has better feats and better stats. She wins by default because the Canon gave her waaaaayyyy better feats and the literal only thing Hiruzen has is a statement made by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. For comparison, in boruto hinata said jiraya may be stronger than adult Naruto and Sasuke. Hinata was talking about base jiraya here. So according to your logic sage mode jiraya >>> adult 6 paths Naruto. Oooooor we will notice that same as Hinata has no idea about how strong jiraya actually was Iruka has no idea about prime Hiruzen, hashirama or tobirama as well and both of their statements are completely irrelevant.\n\n\nMeanwhile tsunade actually has feats that support her winning.",

There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine. But completely ignoring a simple fact that only weakens your side slightly, is just inhuman. This is ridiculous behaviour. And it makes me wonder why I even argue.\n\n\"and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\"\nThat is indeed also one of my bigger problems with Hiruzen. His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \n\n\"You know why characters got stronger?

My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \n\n\"No it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world.

Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak.

Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock.

Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this.

Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke.

I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed.

I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

I watched it for the first time in middle school, but rewatched it as an adult. And the second time, it was hard to watch because of how annoying Naruto was. But I guess the reason it is different to me, is that Naruto never had anyone to teach him. And it took him so long to get any kind of recognition or positive attention. Whereas Sasuke had a lot of people actively trying to reach out and help him. He was always the best in the class. They humanize him a lot more in flashbacks and filler in Shippuden, and you understand a lot more of the story, but I felt like he was always so mean and grumpy to people because they treated him the way Naruto wished he was treated.",

Sasuke was shy/introverted before the massacre. He never liked the attention he got for being an Uchiha before the massacre, why would he like it after? I don't see how he was meaner than the other kids his age, when he just wanted to be left alone for the most part. And canon does a pretty great job of humanizing Sasuke's character. He suffers survivors guilt and PTSD from watching his family be murdered. \n\nthat's why his attachment to naruto makes sense. naruto didn't care that he was an uchiha.",

Of course he couldn't and thats how Sasuke was able to defeat him\n\nIn that moment, Sasuke also let Danzo stab him because he knew he had Karin to heal him. So yea Sasuke would've needed Karin several times over, not only to sense Danzo, and to restore his chakra, but also so he could use her for his last little trick there against Danzo. \n\nNot to say that it wasn't all brilliant, it was his idea to recruit her in the first place, I'm just saying he was far from ready to go through that alone.",

His fights with Kakashi and Orochimaru were classic sharingan \"I look at you and you're dead\", pure brute force with no strategy at all. Kakashi wasn't even kage level at the time. And he ran from Jiraiya, cannot believe his fanboys are pretending he fought him. His fire style and shuriken jutsu are not staples of his fighting style the way sword fighting is with Sasuke's and Sasuke also uses both those techniques.\n\nI don't like Sasuke as a character but you all do the most with him. Kirin alone shows more strategy and innovation than Itachi's entire arsenal.",

Also the adamantine staff is hard as a diamond and diamonds are nowhere near tough enough to survive a rasen shuriken.\nHiruzens speed is on the level of or slower than massively weakened edo hashirama. Tsunade actually tagged edo madara who's near his true strength several times and even destroyed his body when she hit it.

But yeah reading is hard I guess.\n\n\"Madara was toying with them, yes. He was still blocking and dodging their attacks whenever he could.

He's toying with them so yeah he is only dodging the easier attacks, but that's like when youre lying on a couch while playing a video game. He's not sweating, coz he has nothing to fear. If he were to actually try, they'd land like no hits. \n\"The same orochimaru was capable of tagging jiraya and even tsunade before.\" \nFirst of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :) \n\"And mind you this is already fatigued tsunade from the previous healing, summoning, fighting etc.\" Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here. Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed.

It is pretty fuckin hilarious though, that she's affraid of blood as a medical ninja. Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage. A 16 yr old child may I add. And he was able to adapt. Since.. you know.. he's kind of smart and all, which we sadly can't say about Tsunade. And then WOW she won.

He says it like 3 seconds after hashirama summons few trees.\n\n\n\n\"We'll just go ahead and remember you just actually used this sentance: \"Stop taking it out of context.\" WOW. You. You just said that. Anyways. He's toying with them so yeah he is only dodging the easier attacks, but that's like when youre lying on a couch while playing a video game. He's not sweating, coz he has nothing to fear. If he were to actually try, they'd land like no hits. \"\n\nYES HE HAS WTF? If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here. Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed. Or the other dude Tsunade, like the moron she is poisoned, and can therefor no longer controll his chakra correctly. Btw just a sidenote why is Tsunade even Hokage she's fucking dumb. \"\n\nYes. Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands. She was, for a moment about to fuckin, pass out.

The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

And I hate to repeat myself, but that was the point of the whole thing. Enma talkin to him, having to protect him, Hiruzen getting ready to die rather than kill his former student, him having flashbacks, Enma convincing him, him seeing his former mentors revived trying to kill him, his heart was broken and so was his will, but in the end he was able to come to terms with it, and with his old senile body and after being exhausted, managed to while blind seal 2 kage souls and nearly orochimaru, even tho he had kusaganagi stuck in him, which btw is fuckin OP. \n\nAgain, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...\nAlso, since I have a life I am unable to respond to you all too quickly, so if you want your facts a bit quicker I'd recommend videos from Swagkage or SethTheProgrammer.

Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\n\n\n\"To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous. He is said to have mastered every konoha jutsu excluding kekkei genkai. The problems that come with age haven't all left. He is in his old body incapable of a lot, he was able to do when younger. Althogh I don't get why he is in old form since Madara was revived young. \"\n\n\n\nNo it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru. Meanwhile Hiruzen just tried to use an instakill technique but was too weak to pull it off and died alone instead.\n\n\n\n\"Again, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so... Also, since I have a life I am unable to respond to you all too quickly, so if you want your facts a bit quicker I'd recommend videos from Swagkage or SethTheProgrammer. They're not always 100% right but I'd say they know that stuff better than anyone. Some videos if you're too lazy to search: \"\n\n\n\nSwagkage and Seth are honestly fucking Retarded. And Seth is cocky af on top. They are the same people who see Naruto get KOed by a bijuu bomb>level attack and say he could solo Kaguya.\n\n\n\nYou know that in a battle useless statements don't matter right? Tsunade has better feats and better stats. She wins by default because the Canon gave her waaaaayyyy better feats and the literal only thing Hiruzen has is a statement made by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. For comparison, in boruto hinata said jiraya may be stronger than adult Naruto and Sasuke. Hinata was talking about base jiraya here. So according to your logic sage mode jiraya >>> adult 6 paths Naruto. Oooooor we will notice that same as Hinata has no idea about how strong jiraya actually was Iruka has no idea about prime Hiruzen, hashirama or tobirama as well and both of their statements are completely irrelevant.\n\n\nMeanwhile tsunade actually has feats that support her winning.",

There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine. But completely ignoring a simple fact that only weakens your side slightly, is just inhuman. This is ridiculous behaviour. And it makes me wonder why I even argue.\n\n\"and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\"\nThat is indeed also one of my bigger problems with Hiruzen. His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him.

I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1.

Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock.

Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this.

Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke.

I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed.

And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

Sasuke was shy/introverted before the massacre. He never liked the attention he got for being an Uchiha before the massacre, why would he like it after? I don't see how he was meaner than the other kids his age, when he just wanted to be left alone for the most part. And canon does a pretty great job of humanizing Sasuke's character. He suffers survivors guilt and PTSD from watching his family be murdered. \n\nthat's why his attachment to naruto makes sense. naruto didn't care that he was an uchiha.",

If it weren't for her and Shizune (her student), Lee would have never been a ninja again & Choji and Neji would have died after Sasuke Retrieval arc. In fact, Naruto would have died when Kabuto severed his heart's chakra network. \n\nMy point is, while she might have been the \"weakest\" in terms of combat jutsu, she was still a dope ass hokage who did things for the sake of the village that none of the other Hokages could have done.",

His fights with Kakashi and Orochimaru were classic sharingan \"I look at you and you're dead\", pure brute force with no strategy at all. Kakashi wasn't even kage level at the time. And he ran from Jiraiya, cannot believe his fanboys are pretending he fought him. His fire style and shuriken jutsu are not staples of his fighting style the way sword fighting is with Sasuke's and Sasuke also uses both those techniques.\n\nI don't like Sasuke as a character but you all do the most with him. Kirin alone shows more strategy and innovation than Itachi's entire arsenal.",

The same edo madara tanked a massive sage mode rasen shuriken and barely got scratched. Also the adamantine staff is hard as a diamond and diamonds are nowhere near tough enough to survive a rasen shuriken.\nHiruzens speed is on the level of or slower than massively weakened edo hashirama. Tsunade actually tagged edo madara who's near his true strength several times and even destroyed his body when she hit it. She's faster, stronger and more durable than Hiruzen can even wish to be. \n\n\n\n\nAnd who else can Hiruzen even politely ask to fight?

Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed.

She was, for a moment about to fuckin, pass out. He (a child) did indeed get (a bit) beaten by a 50 yr old legendary sannin with millions of days of fighting experience, who happens to be active in the same field as him and should by that logic be a LOOOT better. Which... well... she wasn't. And btw there's no one in the universe who won't use someone's weakness against them in a fight to the death. It is pretty fuckin hilarious though, that she's affraid of blood as a medical ninja. Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage. A 16 yr old child may I add. And he was able to adapt. Since.. you know.. he's kind of smart and all, which we sadly can't say about Tsunade. And then WOW she won. So to win against a child she needs to: -restrict his control over his body completely -have around 200 times his knowledge and experience -a million times better training and -get over her ridiculous fear. It's almost sad.",

                                                    "body": "[Hiruzen at the very beginning of the battle \"I'll kill you now\" ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/010-41.jpg)\n\nSo yeah reading must be hard if you can't read his words at the very beginning of the battle. He says it like 3 seconds after hashirama summons few trees.\n\n\n\n\"We'll just go ahead and remember you just actually used this sentance: \"Stop taking it out of context.\" WOW. You. You just said that. Anyways. He's toying with them so yeah he is only dodging the easier attacks, but that's like when youre lying on a couch while playing a video game. He's not sweating, coz he has nothing to fear. If he were to actually try, they'd land like no hits. \"\n\nYES HE HAS WTF? If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here. Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed. Or the other dude Tsunade, like the moron she is poisoned, and can therefor no longer controll his chakra correctly. Btw just a sidenote why is Tsunade even Hokage she's fucking dumb. \"\n\nYes. Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands. She was, for a moment about to fuckin, pass out. He (a child) did indeed get (a bit) beaten by a 50 yr old legendary sannin with millions of days of fighting experience, who happens to be active in the same field as him and should by that logic be a LOOOT better. Which... well... she wasn't. And btw there's no one in the universe who won't use someone's weakness against them in a fight to the death. It is pretty fuckin hilarious though, that she's affraid of blood as a medical ninja. Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage. A 16 yr old child may I add. And he was able to adapt. Since.. you know.. he's kind of smart and all, which we sadly can't say about Tsunade. And then WOW she won. So to win against a child she needs to: -restrict his control over his body completely -have around 200 times his knowledge and experience -a million times better training and -get over her ridiculous fear. It's almost sad. \"\n\n\nYes the time he\"[Kabuto popped in a Chakra pill to boost himself when tsunade was out of breath before they even began ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/006-71.jpg)\n\n[he landed 1 hit and then immediately got cucked anyway ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/013-71.jpg)\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes of course he used her weakness against her. The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

Stop making shit up Hiruzen literally used q suicide technique that he wanted to kill orochimaru with.\"\nYou know- for a moment- a slight timeframe like 5 comments ago, I thought I'd find myself a civilized discussion over a, to me blatantly obvious, matter. There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine. But completely ignoring a simple fact that only weakens your side slightly, is just inhuman. This is ridiculous behaviour. And it makes me wonder why I even argue.\n\n\"and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\"\nThat is indeed also one of my bigger problems with Hiruzen. His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \n\n\"You know why characters got stronger?

My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \n\n\"No it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\"\nIt's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight. \n\n\"even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal\" \nI legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \n\n\"Swagkage and Seth are honestly fucking Retarded. And Seth is cocky af on top. They are the same people who see Naruto get KOed by a bijuu bomb>level attack and say he could solo Kaguya.\"\nLove the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that.",

Or was that someone else? Because if you speak to me like that you can't genuinely expect me to reply in a polite manner. \n\n\n\n\nAlso please put enough (3 at minimum) spaces between your words because it's annoying to read.\n\n\n\n\n\"His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \"\n\n\nIf Hiruzen saying he will kill orochimaru is not enough proof he wanted to kill him idc about literally anything you say. Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him.

Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \"\n\n\nThat's a common myth lol. Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight.  \"\n\n\nHashirama whipped out diety gates, tobirama tandem paper bombs, Minato used sage mode. Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke. Like even ftg got a bonus lore behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\" I legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \"\n\n\nNo, considering databooks are Canon I'm using them to back up my facts. I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

They humanize him a lot more in flashbacks and filler in Shippuden, and you understand a lot more of the story, but I felt like he was always so mean and grumpy to people because they treated him the way Naruto wished he was treated \n\nthis just sounds like your own headcanon. Sasuke was shy/introverted before the massacre. He never liked the attention he got for being an Uchiha before the massacre, why would he like it after? I don't see how he was meaner than the other kids his age, when he just wanted to be left alone for the most part. And canon does a pretty great job of humanizing Sasuke's character. He suffers survivors guilt and PTSD from watching his family be murdered. \n\nthat's why his attachment to naruto makes sense. naruto didn't care that he was an uchiha.",

Of course he couldn't and thats how Sasuke was able to defeat him\n\nIn that moment, Sasuke also let Danzo stab him because he knew he had Karin to heal him.

Plus he was able to use a tandem paper bomb to destroy on of Hashiramas Deity Gates, which had withstood an attack from the Ten Tails with only minor damage.\n\nMinato is no contest, because of obvious reasons.

In fact, Naruto would have died when Kabuto severed his heart's chakra network. \n\nMy point is, while she might have been the \"weakest\" in terms of combat jutsu, she was still a dope ass hokage who did things for the sake of the village that none of the other Hokages could have done.",

He still can use his neck, sword (which he already hit her with several times) and both feet. And to dodge an attack like that you don't need hands. Actually HOW WOULD THE HANDS EVEN HELP? He can't block the punches or she'll demolish the hands so and the entirety of his body except them was fully capable of dodging, yet he didn't.

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here.

Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands.

One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\n\n\n\"To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous.

Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru. Meanwhile Hiruzen just tried to use an instakill technique but was too weak to pull it off and died alone instead.\n\n\n\n\"Again, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...

There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine.

His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \n\n\"You know why characters got stronger? Because they trained for 3 fucking years. Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\"\nNo shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \n\n\"No it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\"\nIt's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight. \n\n\"even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal\" \nI legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \n\n\"Swagkage and Seth are honestly fucking Retarded. And Seth is cocky af on top. They are the same people who see Naruto get KOed by a bijuu bomb>level attack and say he could solo Kaguya.\"\nLove the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that.",

Or was that someone else? Because if you speak to me like that you can't genuinely expect me to reply in a polite manner. \n\n\n\n\nAlso please put enough (3 at minimum) spaces between your words because it's annoying to read.\n\n\n\n\n\"His logic is sometimes a bit retarded.

Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \"\n\n\nIf Hiruzen saying he will kill orochimaru is not enough proof he wanted to kill him idc about literally anything you say. Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate.

Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \"\n\n\nThat's a common myth lol. Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this.

He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight.  \"\n\n\nHashirama whipped out diety gates, tobirama tandem paper bombs, Minato used sage mode. Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke. Like even ftg got a bonus lore behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\" I legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \"\n\n\nNo, considering databooks are Canon I'm using them to back up my facts. I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

Not to mention he tried to sneak up on her and already attacked her with his sword several times before that. None of those things you mentioned explain why didn't he dodge those attacks. He still can use his neck, sword (which he already hit her with several times) and both feet. And to dodge an attack like that you don't need hands. Actually HOW WOULD THE HANDS EVEN HELP?

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here.

Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands.

The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

That means he would still be strong in shippuden. Just as kakashi and Jiraya became a lot stronger in Shippuden without any training or antything. F.e. Kakashi in pt 1 was fighting Zabuza and rly didn't have too big of an arsenal of jutsus and was kinda slow, where as in shippuden with nearly no training he was spamming shit left and right, including raikiri, which at the start was quite the OP jutsu and with nearly no training hes just spamming that shi-. \nSo I'd say the power creep doesn't make the characters from pt 1 worse since they're percentage wise the same strength as they were before. Although I can understand you better now. \nTo further clarify what I mean though, if you look at Hiruzen vs Orochimaru, which by Shippuden standards would be a Jonin fight at best, was considered a Kage level battle by bystanding Anbu-Elite members.

The reason why he was gone so long is because this fight was supposed to concentrate on the Hokage we hadn't seen before. To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous. He is said to have mastered every konoha jutsu excluding kekkei genkai. The problems that come with age haven't all left. He is in his old body incapable of a lot, he was able to do when younger.

And I hate to repeat myself, but that was the point of the whole thing. Enma talkin to him, having to protect him, Hiruzen getting ready to die rather than kill his former student, him having flashbacks, Enma convincing him, him seeing his former mentors revived trying to kill him, his heart was broken and so was his will, but in the end he was able to come to terms with it, and with his old senile body and after being exhausted, managed to while blind seal 2 kage souls and nearly orochimaru, even tho he had kusaganagi stuck in him, which btw is fuckin OP. \n\nAgain, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so...\nAlso, since I have a life I am unable to respond to you all too quickly, so if you want your facts a bit quicker I'd recommend videos from Swagkage or SethTheProgrammer.

Stop making shit up Hiruzen literally used q suicide technique that he wanted to kill orochimaru with.\"\nYou know- for a moment- a slight timeframe like 5 comments ago, I thought I'd find myself a civilized discussion over a, to me blatantly obvious, matter. There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine. But completely ignoring a simple fact that only weakens your side slightly, is just inhuman. This is ridiculous behaviour. And it makes me wonder why I even argue.\n\n\"and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\"\nThat is indeed also one of my bigger problems with Hiruzen. His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \n\n\"You know why characters got stronger?

And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\"\nNo shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \n\n\"No it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world.

That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\"\nIt's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight. \n\n\"even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal\" \nI legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal.

I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all.

                                    "body": "[Hiruzen saying he'll kill orochimaru from the beginning of the fight. stop making shit up he had the intent to kill majority, if not the entirety of the fight. ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/010-41.jpg)\nIts hilarious how you have no idea on what are you talking about and you're still trying to act like you do. \n\n\n\"You know- for a moment- a slight timeframe like 5 comments ago, I thought I'd find myself a civilized discussion\" \n\n\nAin't you the guy who called tsunade a fat bitch? Or was that someone else? Because if you speak to me like that you can't genuinely expect me to reply in a polite manner. \n\n\n\n\nAlso please put enough (3 at minimum) spaces between your words because it's annoying to read.\n\n\n\n\n\"His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \"\n\n\nIf Hiruzen saying he will kill orochimaru is not enough proof he wanted to kill him idc about literally anything you say. Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \"\n\n\nThat's a common myth lol. Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight.  \"\n\n\nHashirama whipped out diety gates, tobirama tandem paper bombs, Minato used sage mode. Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke. Like even ftg got a bonus lore behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\" I legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \"\n\n\nNo, considering databooks are Canon I'm using them to back up my facts. I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

Madara got tagged by tsunade alone. She didn't had the help of the others at that time. If base tsunades speed = orochimaru then Byakugou tsunade >>> orochimaru anyway so idk what you're trying to get at here. Hiruzen dodging base tsunade punche once or twice would be possible but Byakugou tsunade blitzfucks him. Even according to databooks, part 1 tsunade has 3,5 speed and Hiruzen has 3. And part 1 tsunade couldn't use Byakugou to boost her stats like shippuden meaning shippuden tsunade should be massively faster.\n\nAll that aside, Hiruzen has literally nothing to harm or kill her and weak stamina so even if he just tried to do anything he'll just waste his stamina and die of exhaustion. \n\n\nAnd madara clearly struggled to keep up with 8g guy the entire time + had several of his TSO either teleported away, kamuied or destroyed. He tried to dodge or defend but couldn't keep up.",

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here.

Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands.

The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",

Stop making shit up Hiruzen literally used q suicide technique that he wanted to kill orochimaru with.\n\n\n\"That was in the end after endless amounts of Enma to convince him and even there he was struggling to follow through with it. I'm starting to wonder as to whether you even payed attention in the slightest.\" \n\n\n\nNo it was after Hiruzen got cucked by 0% hashirama and stabbed by orochimaru that he decided to use the suicidal instakill attack and still failed. He never said he isn't trying to kill orochimaru and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\n\n\n\nI get where you come from as that would technically mean he'd be worse. But the timeskip didn't just make the new characters stronger. Everyone got stronger kinda percentage-wise. He was in pt.1 considered the strongest hokage at a point. (Althought I'd say that's bs.) That means he would still be strong in shippuden. Just as kakashi and Jiraya became a lot stronger in Shippuden without any training or antything. F.e. Kakashi in pt 1 was fighting Zabuza and rly didn't have too big of an arsenal of jutsus and was kinda slow, where as in shippuden with nearly no training he was spamming shit left and right, including raikiri, which at the start was quite the OP jutsu and with nearly no training hes just spamming that shi-. So I'd say the power creep doesn't make the characters from pt 1 worse since they're percentage wise the same strength as they were before. Although I can understand you better now. To further clarify what I mean though, if you look at Hiruzen vs Orochimaru, which by Shippuden standards would be a Jonin fight at best, was considered a Kage level battle by bystanding Anbu-Elite members. These same members are able to summon summonings 4 times Hiruzen v Orochimaru-fight summonings with ease. I doubt they learned that in the time skip. I hope that makes it clear.\n\n\n\nYou know why characters got stronger? Because they trained for 3 fucking years. Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\n\n\n\"To say he had nothing stronger is ridiculous. He is said to have mastered every konoha jutsu excluding kekkei genkai. The problems that come with age haven't all left. He is in his old body incapable of a lot, he was able to do when younger. Althogh I don't get why he is in old form since Madara was revived young. \"\n\n\n\nNo it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\n\n\n\nHiruzen tried to kill orochimaru, orochimaru survived and Hiruzen died. Just to compare it, Naruto wasn't trying to kill Sasuke in their battle but we know they're still almost equal (even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal). Not going for the kill would mean Hiruzen would try to use everything he has to immobilize orochimaru. Meanwhile Hiruzen just tried to use an instakill technique but was too weak to pull it off and died alone instead.\n\n\n\n\"Again, I'd like to add he in prime is apparently comparable to Hashirama, so... Also, since I have a life I am unable to respond to you all too quickly, so if you want your facts a bit quicker I'd recommend videos from Swagkage or SethTheProgrammer. They're not always 100% right but I'd say they know that stuff better than anyone. Some videos if you're too lazy to search: \"\n\n\n\nSwagkage and Seth are honestly fucking Retarded. And Seth is cocky af on top. They are the same people who see Naruto get KOed by a bijuu bomb>level attack and say he could solo Kaguya.\n\n\n\nYou know that in a battle useless statements don't matter right? Tsunade has better feats and better stats. She wins by default because the Canon gave her waaaaayyyy better feats and the literal only thing Hiruzen has is a statement made by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. For comparison, in boruto hinata said jiraya may be stronger than adult Naruto and Sasuke. Hinata was talking about base jiraya here. So according to your logic sage mode jiraya >>> adult 6 paths Naruto. Oooooor we will notice that same as Hinata has no idea about how strong jiraya actually was Iruka has no idea about prime Hiruzen, hashirama or tobirama as well and both of their statements are completely irrelevant.\n\n\nMeanwhile tsunade actually has feats that support her winning.",

There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument.

That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine.

His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out.

I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1.

Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight. \n\n\"even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal\" \nI legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga.

Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight.  \"\n\n\nHashirama whipped out diety gates, tobirama tandem paper bombs, Minato used sage mode. Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke. Like even ftg got a bonus lore behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\" I legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \"\n\n\nNo, considering databooks are Canon I'm using them to back up my facts. I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him.

Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning.

One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her.

            "body": "\"Lmao why would Hiruzen literally sacrifice his life to try to kill orochimaru if he could have just killed orochimaru without much trouble and without dying? Stop making shit up Hiruzen literally used q suicide technique that he wanted to kill orochimaru with.\"\nYou know- for a moment- a slight timeframe like 5 comments ago, I thought I'd find myself a civilized discussion over a, to me blatantly obvious, matter. There was a even a point where.. well. You said something that made me reconsider whether Hiruzen maybe wouldn't destroy her completely. And I was impressed. But then I noticed how god damn dense you are. Even after I wrote 100 words about what was going on in Hiruzen's mind. Trying to make you understand that, Enma and he literally midfight had a conversation about how Hiruzen should forget the past. And how he normally should easily win, but was mentally not able to. But you just don't fuckin listen. I doubt you even read what i say. Any normal human being would at least go like: That's true, BUT... and then follow with an argument. Like, I get if you don't agree with some of my statements. But this is literally a fact. And I can not stress this enough, IT HAPPENED. And btw, if you're wrong in one thing, and you realize it. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean you lost the argument. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you realize it, that's perfectly fine. But completely ignoring a simple fact that only weakens your side slightly, is just inhuman. This is ridiculous behaviour. And it makes me wonder why I even argue.\n\n\"and if he actually wasn't going for the kill at that point that just means Hiruzen is literally retarded because not killing orochimaru at that point if he could is like destroying the leaf himself.\"\nThat is indeed also one of my bigger problems with Hiruzen. His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \n\n\"You know why characters got stronger? Because they trained for 3 fucking years. Sasuke went from getting blitzed by Lee with weights to being as fast as Lee without weights in a month. Imagine how would 3 years affect him. That's right. And saying kakashi had no training in between when we literally saw him create a new jutsu (lightning beast running jutsu) and we saw his stats were considerably higher than in his fight with zabuza (his intelligence, taijutsu, speed and Chakra grew by at least 0,5 each). And in verse nothing changed between part 1 and 2. Characters didn't magically get stronger out of nowhere. People trained for 3 years.\"\nNo shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I  know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \n\n\"No it isn't wtf lmao. Hiruzen and others were fighting for their life's and for the life's of the entire world. If he had something stronger he would have used it. And the only jutsu classified as\" hidden leaf jutsu:\"is 1000 years of pain so if you want to give him that statement he has that 1 jutsu on top of what we've seen. Why didn't he destroy the guru guru if it was clearly threatening human life's if he had something he could use? Why didn't he use something more on juubito other than SHURIKEN? That's because he actually has nothing more that would be even remotely useful.\"\nIt's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight. \n\n\"even the databook says Sasuke is Narutos equal\" \nI legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal.

                    "body": "[Hiruzen saying he'll kill orochimaru from the beginning of the fight. stop making shit up he had the intent to kill majority, if not the entirety of the fight. ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/010-41.jpg)\nIts hilarious how you have no idea on what are you talking about and you're still trying to act like you do. \n\n\n\"You know- for a moment- a slight timeframe like 5 comments ago, I thought I'd find myself a civilized discussion\" \n\n\nAin't you the guy who called tsunade a fat bitch? Or was that someone else? Because if you speak to me like that you can't genuinely expect me to reply in a polite manner. \n\n\n\n\nAlso please put enough (3 at minimum) spaces between your words because it's annoying to read.\n\n\n\n\n\"His logic is sometimes a bit retarded. I'm certain he was going to kill Orochimaru for the village, but inside couldn't convinve himself to do so. I'd explain it as kind of a parent effect. Parents often strugle with something like: if their son is a criminal they will often not go to the police stating this. But will also not necessarily protect him. Maybe even give hints to the police. But they can't get themselves to sell them out. In his case it's still dumb af but tbh many characters in Naruto are borderline retarded and I still love 'em (Itachi for example). \"\n\n\nIf Hiruzen saying he will kill orochimaru is not enough proof he wanted to kill him idc about literally anything you say. Hiruzen literally had few flashbacks at the beginning of the fight and after them went \"I'll kill you to something something my past mistakes\". So yes if you want to have this headcanon in your head that he didn't go straight for the kill against serial child murderer who's threatening to destroy the village and kill him until he literally said so then okay he wasn't going all out for about 5 minutes of the fight which was mostly made up of Hiruzen fighting the edo hokage and talking anyway. Then when he actually approached orochimaru himself he said he'll kill him so saying he wasn't going with killing intent is literally going against Hiruzens words. \n\n\n\n\n\"No shit sherlock. My point is even the characters, that didn't train got stronger. Kakashi was my example bcs he has near unlimited chakra in the war arc for no fuckin reason. Things escalate. I know he trained in these years, he also trained his MS. But in the war arc as well as in his past, he spams raikiri even though in pt.1 it was hard af for even him. In his past he spams that while Sasuke, with more chakra, could do way less at the same age. It's coz Shippuden is a lot more \"big magic shit\" than pt 1. Which should be pretty obvious ngl. \"\n\n\nThat's a common myth lol. Kakashi not only did train but in the war arc he gets healed by kyubi and Chakra from him 3+ times and falls to the ground out of fatigue once before getting it. Which was btw at the beginning of the obito battle. So no kakashis Chakra didn't get magically 10x bigger, he just trained and received fuck ton of Chakra from the 9 tails. (just for information the sharingan was the cause of part 1 kakashis low stamina and since he mastered it in the 3 year time skip his pre-war arc Chakra reserves should also be considerably stronger)\n\n\n\n\"It's depressing, that I have to explain this. Kishimoto is too lazy to invent a few jutsus on the spot to give a character, that has nothing to do with the current theme, more screentime and relevance. In this case by hidden leaf jutsu I mean jutsu used by the hidden leaf. Why tf would Kishimoto say he's comparable to Hashirama and then make him weak. He was focusing on the other Hokage, that's why Hiruzen was gone for half of the fight.  \"\n\n\nHashirama whipped out diety gates, tobirama tandem paper bombs, Minato used sage mode. Every other hokage got something new but Hiruzen was stuck at elemental jutsus and shuriken. Kishimoto clearly wasn't lazy to give others fuck ton of jutsus but you say the person known for knowing fuck ton of jutsus didn't get any new because kishimoto is lazy? Bruh that must be a joke. Like even ftg got a bonus lore behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\" I legit am starting to think you only read the databooks but never the manga. I love Sasuke. A lot more than Naruto. But he wasn't his equal. He was close but not equal. I hate to burst your bubble mate, but the databooks are more of a general reference as opposed to the all knowing facts book. \"\n\n\nNo, considering databooks are Canon I'm using them to back up my facts. I actually think Naruto when they fought was MASSIVELY stronger than Sasuke by himself but adult Naruto and Sasuke are stated as equal. The point is that Naruto not going for the kill doesn't mean he wasn't going all out to immobilize Sasuke meaning their speed and battle ability should be near equal. You know what's funny? If Naruto used boil release he could one shot Sasuke with a Chakra punch. But Hiruzen has shown only 1 ability capable of killing orochimaru and he used that one on orochimaru. So yes orochimaru is stronger than Hiruzen and yes the databooks are Canon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love the language choice. I can tell you I am no fan of them. I'm not even subscribed. And sometimes they say questionable stuff. But never have they been 100% wrong. Even when I disagree they have points that make me reconsider. They know their stuff, I mean, they make a living off of it after all. Although That thing about Naruto and kaguya sounds interesting lmao. I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong ones on that. \"\n\n\n\nYeah the funny thing is i actually do like swagkage. But that doesn't make his opinions any less stupid to me. He's just entertaining. And are you actually saying Naruto could defeat Kaguya in a 1v1? ADULT Naruto at that? \nYou know, yes they make living off of it. You know what that means? They ride the hype wave and say whatever majority of people believe because that will make them more fans and more money. 3-4 years ago majority of people thought momoshiki could solo Kaguya and they were laughing about how he destroys her. Now after people stopped dickriding the hype on a new otsutsiki and started using their brains, no sane person will tell you base momoshiki has any chance to win the fight and no even slightly intelligent person will claim fused momoshiki will beat her. And the feats are there and they didn't change. Fused Momoshiki was always struggling to hit rusty base half power Naruto and Naruto always said he's rusty and his feats were way worse than war arc Narutos. These facts didn't change. They always pointed at Kaguya 0 diffing momoshiki. But since momoshiki was the hype character back then swag, Seth and others were acting as if it didn't exist and claiming he stomps her. So if these people actually went by facts and \"knew their stuff\" they wouldn't have made claims this stupid. They would have said the facts, but that wasn't what people wanted to hear so they didn't say it. And Hiruzen is a character who has INCREDIBLE amounts of fanboys so obviously making videos jerking him off will give them popularity. I think we can agree itachi is the most overhyped character in the series. And Seth still made a video saying he's underrated. You know why? To appeal to fanboys. So next time make your own opinions and don't copy opinions of some YouTube guy who's talking out of his ass",

Meaning all we know is that he can use some elemental jutsu, summon enma (it's funny you keep mentioning it but you don't know it's name) and use the technique used to stick your fingers inside someones asshole. Madara got tagged by tsunade alone. She didn't had the help of the others at that time. If base tsunades speed = orochimaru then Byakugou tsunade >>> orochimaru anyway so idk what you're trying to get at here. Hiruzen dodging base tsunade punche once or twice would be possible but Byakugou tsunade blitzfucks him. Even according to databooks, part 1 tsunade has 3,5 speed and Hiruzen has 3. And part 1 tsunade couldn't use Byakugou to boost her stats like shippuden meaning shippuden tsunade should be massively faster.\n\nAll that aside, Hiruzen has literally nothing to harm or kill her and weak stamina so even if he just tried to do anything he'll just waste his stamina and die of exhaustion. \n\n\nAnd madara clearly struggled to keep up with 8g guy the entire time + had several of his TSO either teleported away, kamuied or destroyed. He tried to dodge or defend but couldn't keep up.",

            "body": "[Hiruzen at the very beginning of the battle \"I'll kill you now\" ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/010-41.jpg)\n\nSo yeah reading must be hard if you can't read his words at the very beginning of the battle. He says it like 3 seconds after hashirama summons few trees.\n\n\n\n\"We'll just go ahead and remember you just actually used this sentance: \"Stop taking it out of context.\" WOW. You. You just said that. Anyways. He's toying with them so yeah he is only dodging the easier attacks, but that's like when youre lying on a couch while playing a video game. He's not sweating, coz he has nothing to fear. If he were to actually try, they'd land like no hits. \"\n\nYES HE HAS WTF? If they destroy his body they can then seal him away same as the 3rd raikage. Nobody could hurt him but the moment his body was destroyed he got immobilized and they sealed him. That's why he dodged and blocked anything that could be dangerous to him. Saying otherwise is taking \"he was toying with them\" out of context and literally making shit up because madara was clearly making sure they won't get to seal him. He was toying with them in a way that he didn't just whip out his perfect susanoo dick and slapped everyone, but he still made sure to defend everyone's attacks. \n\n\n\n\n\"First of all that proves my point of Orochimaru being (in pt 1) the by far strongest Sanin and also just, trynna help but, Jiraya was literally poisoned :)\" \n\n\nPart 1 orochimaru was slightly stronger than the others. Keep in mind he still lost that fight once tsunade stopped being afraid of blood. And yes jiraya was drugged but tsunade was fatigued and that doesn't change the fact that we've seen him use his sword, bite people (he still has the ability to give curse mark) and use his legs all to their full extent. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, she's deffo the one fatigued here. Not the dude that's so sick he'll die from it in a few years and spends all his time in bed. Or the other dude Tsunade, like the moron she is poisoned, and can therefor no longer controll his chakra correctly. Btw just a sidenote why is Tsunade even Hokage she's fucking dumb. \"\n\nYes. Yes she is. She protected Naruto and got stabbed with the same sword Hiruzen did SEVERAL TIMES, healed Naruto, summoned Katsuyu which used her acid (Katsuyu unlike other summonings uses the Chakra of the summoner) AND survived a panic shock which can literally knock people unconscious. Meanwhile Orochimaru wasted basically no Chakra as the only jutsu used was summoning. So yes tsunade was in base and fatigued while orochimaru couldn't use his arms which she would have just crushed anyway.\n\n\n\"I love how you skipped a big fraction of the fight where kabuto rekt her with his chakra hands. She was, for a moment about to fuckin, pass out. He (a child) did indeed get (a bit) beaten by a 50 yr old legendary sannin with millions of days of fighting experience, who happens to be active in the same field as him and should by that logic be a LOOOT better. Which... well... she wasn't. And btw there's no one in the universe who won't use someone's weakness against them in a fight to the death. It is pretty fuckin hilarious though, that she's affraid of blood as a medical ninja. Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage. A 16 yr old child may I add. And he was able to adapt. Since.. you know.. he's kind of smart and all, which we sadly can't say about Tsunade. And then WOW she won. So to win against a child she needs to: -restrict his control over his body completely -have around 200 times his knowledge and experience -a million times better training and -get over her ridiculous fear. It's almost sad. \"\n\n\nYes the time he\"[Kabuto popped in a Chakra pill to boost himself when tsunade was out of breath before they even began ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/006-71.jpg)\n\n[he landed 1 hit and then immediately got cucked anyway ](https://naruto-shippuden-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/013-71.jpg)\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes of course he used her weakness against her. The point is she overcame the weakness and it was the only reason she struggled at any point. Fatigue and her phobia. Meanwhile full power kabuto here boosted by Chakra pills was getting cucked by this fatigued old lady.\n\n\"Speaking of pussies, she made him lose control over his body so she could gain an advantage.\"\n\n\nIf you don't see the difference between using your ability and hitting someone with it and cutting your own wrist to use their phobia on them i genuinely don't know what to tell you. One is a sign of skill and ability while the other is cowardly abusing something the other person has no control over.\n\n\nAlso 16 year old child is not an argument. Naruto was the 2nd strongest human alive at the age of 16. And kabuto was comperable to kakashi (weaker but comperable).\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFatigued tsunade stomped orochimaru, Byakugou tsunade could damage madaras susanoo ribcage, she could also tag madara himself and has healing ability and durability so high Hiruzen can't even harm her. Meanwhile Hiruzen was getting cucked by orochimaru and like 0,5% hashirama in base.\n\n\nFeats>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> your opinion sooo tsunade grannyfucks Hiruzen.",
