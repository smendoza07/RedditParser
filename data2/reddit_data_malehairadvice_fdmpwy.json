You looked like you didn\u2019t care about you what you looked, which might also say that you didn\u2019t care about others opinions. Nobody wants to talk to someone who doesn\u2019t seem to care. But you look like you do. And you really do, you made an entire post asking for advice. \n\nHope you get what you\u2019re looking for with this new style. And don\u2019t stop improving!
