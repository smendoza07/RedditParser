Tenzo was the name of a boy abducted by Orochimaru (donated by his clan) in exchange for Orochimaru's helping the clan stabilize their dangerous kekkei genkai (they could turn into smoke, but it was mostly involuntary until Orochimaru used his sealing abilities to stabilize them). \n\nIt is heavily implied that Tenzo and Yamato were both lab rats for Orochimaru at the same time and that Yamato watched Tenzo die while both were restrained in seperate vats of liquid. Yamato was later released into the care of Danzo. \n\nWhen Orochimaru fled the Leaf after Hiruzen discovered his experiments, Yamato was sent by Danzo to help him escape. He and Kakashi encountered the clan, and Tenzo's sister mistook Yamato for Tenzo. Yamato and Kalashi bonded and tried unsuccessfully to protect the clan from Orochimaru who absorbed their chakra to make himself stronger. \n\nKalashi now occasionally calls Yamato \"Tenzo\" because it is a cute reminder of the day they became friends.",

Tenzo was the name of a boy abducted by Orochimaru (donated by his clan) in exchange for Orochimaru's helping the clan stabilize their dangerous kekkei genkai (they could turn into smoke, but it was mostly involuntary until Orochimaru used his sealing abilities to stabilize them). \n\nIt is heavily implied that Tenzo and Yamato were both lab rats for Orochimaru at the same time and that Yamato watched Tenzo die while both were restrained in seperate vats of liquid. Yamato was later released into the care of Danzo. \n\nWhen Orochimaru fled the Leaf after Hiruzen discovered his experiments, Yamato was sent by Danzo to help him escape. He and Kakashi encountered the clan, and Tenzo's sister mistook Yamato for Tenzo. Yamato and Kalashi bonded and tried unsuccessfully to protect the clan from Orochimaru who absorbed their chakra to make himself stronger. \n\nKalashi now occasionally calls Yamato \"Tenzo\" because it is a cute reminder of the day they became friends.",
