    "body": "Rant incoming. (I just have no one in my life to talk to about this, so I came to one of my favorite subs to share). My SD was overall a decent, well-intentioned guy, and was probably a 2/10, was 65, and very overweight; just to give you an idea. \n\nDespite that, I realized during our many sexual encounters that when he did something really good in bed I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Looks honestly didn\u2019t matter in those moments. But when he did stuff that turned me off (95% of his moves), it all became too much.\nThe biggest thing was that he was such a slobbery kisser. I LOVE kissing with lots of tongue. I love when it gets a little messy even. But this was next level messy. It felt like he was just drooling and licking like a dog into my mouth. And he would want to do this for a 20-60 minutes as foreplay. And his breath always smelled and tasted like onions! I\u2019ll never forget how I would have to constantly swallow his saliva that was gathering in the back of my throat.... \ud83e\udd22.  Our last few times together I felt the slight reflex of wanting to gag or spit it out and had to force my mind to relax. \n\nHe would also want to lick all over around and in my ear and on my neck, leaving his smelly breath and spit behind on every inch he could get to. He also wanted to fuck for like an hour straight, and when you\u2019re barely horny for a man.. that shits BRUTAL. And boring. He did make me realize though that even if you\u2019re on the smaller side, it can still feel incredible when hitting the right spots. \n\nI mentioned before that he was overweight, and was so in that typical old man way where all the weight was in his stomach, so sometimes it felt like he was crushing me. When he would try to dirty talk in my ear, it was really cheesy stuff. And when he would cum he would jerk and spazz around like he was a fish on land and basically lip roll, spraying spit in my face.\n(Not sure if that\u2019s a side effect from a medication or something). \n\nI overall got not only so bored from those experiences, but so grossed out that I called it quits recently. I have zero regrets. I do miss the money though.\n\nEDIT: I must say that the drooling wasn\u2019t as severe as the people in the comments are probably thinking but definitely enough for it to be pretty noticeable multiple times during each time we\u2019d kiss. Okay so I guess it was still bad :/",

So he walks me to my car, and I am getting ready for the best kiss of my life.  He literally sucks all the air out of my lungs, and I start coughing and choking!

Safe to say kissing him made me want to vomit right in his mouth. It only lasted for 4 months. But I got a good deal out of it anyways. I never spent a dollar of my own money & I got a good chunk of cash before I left him. Worth it for what I had to tolerate tbh. I never hated swallowing saliva so much in my life. Christ!!",

So now any time I meet a new partner or a new potential in the sugar bowl, I just establish before my first intimate encounter that I hate Frenching. \n\n\nI'll keep doing it with those who I already know are good at it, but I'm not risking it anymore with newcomers.
