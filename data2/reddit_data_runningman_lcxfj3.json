The only 2 fails was the first which most guessed wrongly because they didn't expect a fake to be built from scratch, and ep 6 which all (except Somin) guessed wrongly.\n\nLowest number of correct guesses is poor Nara, who was only correct once and had to shave eyebrows twice.\n\nLuckiest members were YJS and Mijoo, who didn't get any real eyebrow shaving punishment despite being wrong in 5 episodes. Especially for YJS as it'll be funny for him to paint eyebrows. Unluckiest were Jessi, who had 1 eyebrow shaving out of 2 wrong guesses, and Somin who had to shave eyebrows twice out of 4 wrong guesses.",
