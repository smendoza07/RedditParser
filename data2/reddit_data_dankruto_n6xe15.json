However, I will concede that Gaara being nerfed doesn't really correlate to Sasuke and Naruto's insane growth, and was done more to make him more vulnerable for the sake of suspense in various points of the manga.\n\n Surprisingly, despite my earlier comment, I actually love DBZ and highly recommend it. The power scaling is a bit nutty later on, but by then you are invested in the interesting story, fascinating characters and imaginative setting. Even the power level stuff is dropped later on and Toriyama plays it more by ear from there, so it wasn't as obtrusive as some make it out to be. A bit nonsensical, but quite the spectacle, making it entertaining to watch. But I can get why that may put some people off. It's why I stopped after Ressurection F. Super (the parts not just re-capping the two movies just prior to the show) is just a bit too much for me. Though I did go to theaters to watch the new Broly movie. It was awesome and a return to old form, because it was technically a remake after all. A remake that far surpassed the original.\n\nLol, sorry for going on a DBZ rant in a Naruto sub. I'm just really passionate about both of these shows (and many others, lol).",

How tf did Kakashi make this kid grow to Lee WITH HIS WEIGHTS OFF level speed so fast? Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

However, I will concede that Gaara being nerfed doesn't really correlate to Sasuke and Naruto's insane growth, and was done more to make him more vulnerable for the sake of suspense in various points of the manga.\n\n Surprisingly, despite my earlier comment, I actually love DBZ and highly recommend it. The power scaling is a bit nutty later on, but by then you are invested in the interesting story, fascinating characters and imaginative setting. Even the power level stuff is dropped later on and Toriyama plays it more by ear from there, so it wasn't as obtrusive as some make it out to be. A bit nonsensical, but quite the spectacle, making it entertaining to watch. But I can get why that may put some people off. It's why I stopped after Ressurection F. Super (the parts not just re-capping the two movies just prior to the show) is just a bit too much for me. Though I did go to theaters to watch the new Broly movie. It was awesome and a return to old form, because it was technically a remake after all. A remake that far surpassed the original.\n\nLol, sorry for going on a DBZ rant in a Naruto sub. I'm just really passionate about both of these shows (and many others, lol).",

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

However, I will concede that Gaara being nerfed doesn't really correlate to Sasuke and Naruto's insane growth, and was done more to make him more vulnerable for the sake of suspense in various points of the manga.\n\n Surprisingly, despite my earlier comment, I actually love DBZ and highly recommend it. The power scaling is a bit nutty later on, but by then you are invested in the interesting story, fascinating characters and imaginative setting. Even the power level stuff is dropped later on and Toriyama plays it more by ear from there, so it wasn't as obtrusive as some make it out to be. A bit nonsensical, but quite the spectacle, making it entertaining to watch. But I can get why that may put some people off. It's why I stopped after Ressurection F. Super (the parts not just re-capping the two movies just prior to the show) is just a bit too much for me. Though I did go to theaters to watch the new Broly movie. It was awesome and a return to old form, because it was technically a remake after all. A remake that far surpassed the original.\n\nLol, sorry for going on a DBZ rant in a Naruto sub. I'm just really passionate about both of these shows (and many others, lol).",

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

However, I will concede that Gaara being nerfed doesn't really correlate to Sasuke and Naruto's insane growth, and was done more to make him more vulnerable for the sake of suspense in various points of the manga.\n\n Surprisingly, despite my earlier comment, I actually love DBZ and highly recommend it. The power scaling is a bit nutty later on, but by then you are invested in the interesting story, fascinating characters and imaginative setting. Even the power level stuff is dropped later on and Toriyama plays it more by ear from there, so it wasn't as obtrusive as some make it out to be. A bit nonsensical, but quite the spectacle, making it entertaining to watch. But I can get why that may put some people off. It's why I stopped after Ressurection F. Super (the parts not just re-capping the two movies just prior to the show) is just a bit too much for me. Though I did go to theaters to watch the new Broly movie. It was awesome and a return to old form, because it was technically a remake after all. A remake that far surpassed the original.\n\nLol, sorry for going on a DBZ rant in a Naruto sub. I'm just really passionate about both of these shows (and many others, lol).",

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

However, I will concede that Gaara being nerfed doesn't really correlate to Sasuke and Naruto's insane growth, and was done more to make him more vulnerable for the sake of suspense in various points of the manga.\n\n Surprisingly, despite my earlier comment, I actually love DBZ and highly recommend it. The power scaling is a bit nutty later on, but by then you are invested in the interesting story, fascinating characters and imaginative setting. Even the power level stuff is dropped later on and Toriyama plays it more by ear from there, so it wasn't as obtrusive as some make it out to be. A bit nonsensical, but quite the spectacle, making it entertaining to watch. But I can get why that may put some people off. It's why I stopped after Ressurection F. Super (the parts not just re-capping the two movies just prior to the show) is just a bit too much for me. Though I did go to theaters to watch the new Broly movie. It was awesome and a return to old form, because it was technically a remake after all. A remake that far surpassed the original.\n\nLol, sorry for going on a DBZ rant in a Naruto sub. I'm just really passionate about both of these shows (and many others, lol).",

I know Bee is Kage level too but damn. Then the next upgrade to Eternal Mangekyou made him fast enough to fight Madara (a bit) and keep up with Naruto with full Kurama control but then the Sage chakra made him fast enough to fight Madara as the 10 tails jinchuriki too?

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

However, I will concede that Gaara being nerfed doesn't really correlate to Sasuke and Naruto's insane growth, and was done more to make him more vulnerable for the sake of suspense in various points of the manga.\n\n Surprisingly, despite my earlier comment, I actually love DBZ and highly recommend it. The power scaling is a bit nutty later on, but by then you are invested in the interesting story, fascinating characters and imaginative setting. Even the power level stuff is dropped later on and Toriyama plays it more by ear from there, so it wasn't as obtrusive as some make it out to be. A bit nonsensical, but quite the spectacle, making it entertaining to watch. But I can get why that may put some people off. It's why I stopped after Ressurection F. Super (the parts not just re-capping the two movies just prior to the show) is just a bit too much for me. Though I did go to theaters to watch the new Broly movie. It was awesome and a return to old form, because it was technically a remake after all. A remake that far surpassed the original.\n\nLol, sorry for going on a DBZ rant in a Naruto sub. I'm just really passionate about both of these shows (and many others, lol).",

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

Like Sasuke just always leveled up and was super fast each time...mostly with his eyes.\n\n*Mostly with his eyes.* There's your answer. The stronger his eyes got, he naturally got stronger as well. Always makes me wonder if the Sharingan does more than just let you analyze things at atom level with precog, because every time his eyes upgraded, he did. Literally on the spot. Like when he first awakened his third tomoe getting rushed by chakra cloak Naruto. And like you said, at the Kage summit with the MS he was able to fight with some Kage for a bit(still lost, but very impressive nonetheless). EMS he was keeping up with Bijuu Sage Mode Naruto in the war. Shit's crazy. Even Lee broke it down and said it doesn't matter if his eyes can keep up if he can't, so the concept definitely applies but rules looked like they changed a bit.\n\nImo the Sharingan without a doubt enhances physical capabilities, regardless what anyone says. At least in the speed department. There's no way it doesn't.",

And I also never see people point out that Sasuke's Rinnegan had the tomoe(s) on it when even Madara and Obito's didnt. Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",

Madara/Kaguya's third eye did, and also the reflection off the moon, but still Sasuke's theoretically was a higher level (or the highest) and made him just generally stronger than them. Obviously Kaguya had the ocean of sage chakra though + byakugan.\n\nSenju and Uchiha really were OP (but of course they were just branches of the overarching Otsusuki's in the first place)\n\nEdit: another supporting example to this theory is how Kakashi passed out when his eye was forced into the Mangekyou but Obito could handle it. There's a pretty clear pattern of direct stress on the body to the eyes themselves, aside from chakra consumption",
