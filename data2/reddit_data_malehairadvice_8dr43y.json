Not to put a price on quality but usually these places charge $25-35 for a haircut. ",

He said I\u2019m not done. 30 minutes from then he started on the front l, but on the first cut he took 4 inches off the 4.75 inches. And at that point I said that\u2019s too short he said you said cut it a little bit and I did, I\u2019m like that\u2019s way too much. Then I payed and left. He did not communicate. And I noticed he fucked up when he took off 4 inches in one cut and at that point it was too late. I\u2019m about to just start going to salons.",

I closed my eyes because the hair was flying around and going in. I feel him go towards my temple. Open my eyes to see that the guy had receded my hairline in that single second. I asked him why he pushed the trimmer so far up. \"Let me finish the rest, it will look better than the picture\". Now, a month later, I have this weird line of very short hair which is my actual hairline, and longer hair (around 3 inches) behind that. I was actually happy with that place and my regular stylist.

It's just not worth it since my hair grows so fast I need to get it cut every 2 weeks.\n\nOn the other hand, I do agree with you - I've gone to stylists/barbers with pictures of my own hair (after a good cut) and they've fucked it up so bad I never went back. The desired results are absolutely possible, but they just don't have the experience, ability, or willingness to cut difficult hair yet.",

Visualizing the haircut onto you  headshape as everyone have different shape of the head or hair type\n2. Familiar with the clients hair and type of cut. As in the first would be alright but typically the following cuts thereafter the initial are better.\n\nWhy do I know this? I cut my own hair and friends haircuts. Even though I cut my hair and some cousins for 6 years cutting friends hair I never did in the past provided is challenges, primarily the 2 I discussed. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the barbers haircut and are picky like me, I suggest you just learn to cut your own hair. It\u2019s reward, though it will take some time going form a 2hr haircut to a 20min haircut clean fade and what not. ",

My barber gave me a tip - when you get a haircut you REALLY like, take pictures of all angles, and bring those back in so they know what they're working with and what's attainable, as well as a picture of a desired cut. \n\nMany pictures posted asking this question are of models who had stylists. Product, blow dry, hairspray, placement etc. all play a role and you probably won't have your hair looking like that all day anyways. \n\nYour own hair qualities play a role as well. If you have thin, straight hair, don't bring in a picture of someone with thick, wavy hair. It won't happen (sea salt spray will only do so much), and you'll be disappointed. \n\nDetermine your hair type and texture, and look for styles that are in line with it. Also, don't be afraid to spend a little bit more on a haircut from time to time. Not saying you can't get a great cut for $10, but it doesn't hurt to splurge now and then. \n",

Just work with what looks best with your head shape and your over all style. ALSO, do NOT get a haircut  that looks absolutely styled if you plan on putting 0 effort into your hair. People don't wake up with their shit perfect, ifyou want longer hair that looks even remotely like the guys in the photos in the banner on this sub, expect to put some effort in.",

It's just not worth it since my hair grows so fast I need to get it cut every 2 weeks.\n\nOn the other hand, I do agree with you - I've gone to stylists/barbers with pictures of my own hair (after a good cut) and they've fucked it up so bad I never went back. The desired results are absolutely possible, but they just don't have the experience, ability, or willingness to cut difficult hair yet.",
