    "body": "Back In January I created this post: [My SB only wants to have sex. Is this weird or did I hit the jackpot?](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/sh2sv5/my_sb_only_wants_to_have_sex_is_this_weird_or_did/)\n\nI got some really great advice before and after I had met her (Let's call her E). I really appreciated the great feedback from the community, it was extremely helpful.\n\nBack when I had made the original post I was engaged, miserable, and going through the worst depression since my college years. I was dedicated on ending my 9 year relationship and decided to look at sugaring to keep my sanity as I took time to get my affairs in order. Honestly, I should have just waited but I didn't. I just wanted to go on a few nice dates, have sex and feel **normal.** I messaged E on seeking and we had instant chemistry. I was so surprised! We have a 12 year age gap so we are able to relate on a lot of things while still having that younger woman, older man type relationship. But with the holidays we weren't going to be able to meet for another month. So I broke a SLF rule. I sent her money without meeting to keep her interested. I offered a meager weekly allowance so I could have her attention. I never asked for nudes. I barely asked anything sexually related. I just wanted to talk and get to know her. It was great. We spoke on the phone everyday and the chemistry was apparent. I found out later that this approach was the main reason she took me seriously.\n\nWe finally met in January and as I had seen on the phone, the chemistry was immediate. We had a M&G lunch date that lasted 5 hours before the waiter kicked us out. Two weeks later we were able to have a real meeting. Our chemistry was even more intense in the bedroom and we spent the entire day having sex. We hadn't talked about sex too much before, but E and I are both very sexual people. She made it clear to me that she was perfectly fine just spending 4 to 5 hours having sex. No date or activity necessary. I was so confused and made my original post. Within the next few months we were both having the best sex of our lives. Meanwhile I finally ended my relationship in February, moved out, got my own place, and E was coming over consistently. Things were getting better and better **yet I was getting more and more frustrated**. The sex was nonstop. Over summer I had more sex than I had in the last decade. Still, I couldn't help but feel drawn to her romantically. She's so warm, so loving, so sweet. She makes me laugh so often and makes me feel like no one else has. It was breaking my heart because I knew she didn't want a real relationship. I remember taking a hot shower and wanting to cry because I felt like I found the woman I've been looking for my whole life, but she didn't want the same thing. She wouldn't love me back. She would leave as soon as the allowance went away. I put my guards back up and tried to put some emotional distance between us as I thought about ending the arrangement.\n\nBy August E was basically living at my place. I didn't change her allowance, I didn't change her gifts, my attitude. No, she just wanted to spend time with me. I'd come home and she had dinner ready, she cleaned my house, and took care of me. All with a happy smile on her face. I started noticing that maybe I'm not the only one with feelings. We were having more real dates, she started meeting my friends. We were still having filthy, amazing sex but I couldn't help but notice the way she would look at me.\n\nSo I told her I was falling for her, and to my surprise she smiled back and said the same thing. We continued having the best time together. She went back to school. We saw each other less, but she always made time for me. In fact, she always made more time for me than what we had agreed on. I was happy but still, I was missing what I actually wanted.\n\nI sat her down and told her how I felt, how I wanted the real thing, how I wanted to be her boyfriend and work towards a serious relationship. I was so nervous but I could see her in eyes that she had been waiting for me to ask this. She said yes :) A month later we were in bed and she was staring at me awkwardly with her big blue eyes. She nervously said I Love You. my hearted melted, we both shed little tears, embraced, and had the best sex of my life - at the time ;)\n\nOver a year later since my original message to her I can say I have found the love of my life. I found what true love feels like, what the relationship I've always wanted feels like, what the embrace of someone who's so affectionate and loving feels like. We may have a terrible origin story, but I wouldn't change a thing. I'll be asking her to move in with me when she finishes school this spring and I surprised her with a Caribbean cruise for spring break.\n\nSo one last time, thank you SLF. This board changed my life in the best way and I'm incredibly grateful for everyone here. I hope all of you can find true life as I have.",
