Maybe they think that they're losing money. Or maybe my understanding of this is skewed?",

As to why it's missing, I dont really know, probably because of license? The best way to preserve it would be downloading, since I am sure it will also get taken down sooner or later. There are collections available on avistaz, I have them as well on gdrive from start to 2021.",
