    "body": "Quite some time ago I was in a loveless and sexless marriage. When you are married, post children and wake up one day to realize that sexual desire for more is burning so brightly in your soul - you\u2019ll do almost anything to quench that thirst. \n\nSo there I was, considered still within my prime, but the tricky fact that I was married was holding me back from signing up on PoF. So, of course, I did what any woman would do. I signed up for a website, that shall not be named, shortly before it was hacked. \n\nMy initial affairs off that website are irrelevant. Mostly men who didn\u2019t know their way around a woman\u2019s body *or her mind*. But then one day, right before I was about to delete my profile, I received a message from a man that piqued my interest. He made a joke about my profile, told me he\u2019d never *done this* before, and explained his reasoning for being there. \n\nWhen he opened his photos to me I thought - okay, I\u2019m not really attracted, but he\u2019s not *terrible* looking. We will call him J, and J was younger than me, bald, slightly to moderately overweight, with a big ol\u2019 gap between his front teeth. But he had kind eyes, a witty sense of humor, and he loved to make me laugh.\n\nWe talked for weeks via apps. We played trivia online together, Pictionary, scrabble, and whole bunch of other games. Yet, we still hadn\u2019t met. Almost 3 weeks went by and I knew everything about this man, except what he looked like in person. We\u2019d opened up to each other about our marriages. We\u2019d laughed together, I\u2019d cried to him about a recent event, and we even watched movies on tv together and texted in between commercial breaks about the plot lines. \n\nJ was successful, in so much that he\u2019d worked his way up the corporate ladder and was about halfway through where he wanted to be. Though he was young, he was driven. We never talked money, but I knew he made it.\n\nOne day, J asked me to meet him for lunch. I hesitantly agreed, as I was positive that the relationship would never go anywhere. I wasn\u2019t attracted to the photos he\u2019d sent in the traditional sense, and I felt that we\u2019d moved more into friend territory. Actually, it came up at one point and he said to me: \u2018If you and I just remain friends, I know that I\u2019ll never try to find someone else to sleep with.\u2019\n\nI arrived early to the restaurant. It was nice but in a crappy area. I had my back to the door and I was the only one there save for the waiters. I heard him walk in and I kept my menu up around my eyes. I was afraid to look. I was afraid that I would see him and be repulsed by what I saw. I remember seeing his shoes as he came to stand next to where I was sitting. I stared at the menu as he stared at me. I\u2019m positive it was only seconds, but time stood still. The menu shook in my hands and I think I was sweating. \n\nI finally looked up. And there he was, all 6 feet burly man of him, the florescent light glistening off his bald head. At least, I think the light was glistening. I\u2019m not quite sure because I couldn\u2019t see anything but his smile. A smile so wide that I imagined animals going to roost in the gap between his front teeth. But that smile, it could kill a woman. It was the smile of every goofy, affable man in every romantic comedy ever written. When authors write about smiles that slay virgins they used this man as their inspiration. \n\nI don\u2019t remember what we talked about that day. But we spent hours in the restaurant. When he finally kissed me 3 dates later, I\u2019d worked myself up into such a tizzy over whether or not our kissing styles were compatible that he missed me the first pass at my face. I was trying to run away from him, prolong the possibility of the inevitable fall out from him being a bad kisser. When he moved, in I turned my cheek, and he got my ear. He laughed. He laughed in a way that meant - *I both love you and hate you right now*. And then he reached out with his hand, molded his fingers to the side of my face and held me there while his lips met mine. I\u2019ve never before been kissed like that and I long for the day a man will kiss me like that again. \n\nOur affair was long and beautiful. The gifts started soon after our third date. Little trinkets that eventually led to gift cards and shopping sprees. I had money so I didn\u2019t need the stuff and my husband never questioned where it came from. Eventually J started compensating my days I took off to be with him. We traveled to hotels but only in our own city. We ate take out in bed and then had sex on the empty boxes. Once we had a food fight that involved pizza and soda and a $500 room cleaning bill. My bra was the only casualty. We continued to play online games together every night. \n\nWe\u2019d lay for hours while I ran my fingers over his skin. He was the first man I\u2019d dated that had hair everywhere but his head. I loved the way the different textures of his body felt under my hands. He\u2019d take conference calls with the video off while I gave him blow jobs under the hotel room desk. Once we even got our children together for a play date at the mall. Thankfully, our kids were too young to remember that. \n\nJ is the man that opened my eyes to the wonderful world of married men. They are passionate, and curious, and so loving. The right married man, though he cannot offer you the entire world, will give you a piece of heaven that is so glorious that you will want to set up shop and spend your end of days in his embrace. All the good and none of the bad. \n\nWhen I search for an SD now, I look for someone like J. Someone with the world to give, but where the money and gifts is secondary to all the other wonderful things he can provide. There are women like us out there. We live silently in the shadows because that is where we thrive. We are mistresses. And we love. We love who you are and what you do for us. Yes, sometimes we long for more, but we know - having more is never the same. \n\nI remember our days fondly, J. And I always will. I do not know whether I\u2019ll find someone that makes me feel like you did. I\u2019ve made peace with that. Someone else may have made me a woman. But you made me feel alive. ",
