    "body": "I have no problem whatsoever talking about sexual preferences prior to a M&G. In fact, I actually prefer to discuss that before (and the topic of allowance). \n\nThat said, I am BEYOND annoyed with the overly sexual comments. I cannot count on my hands the number of times a POT has asked me, \u201cAre you submissive?\u201d and then followed up with something like \u201cI think you\u2019d look good on your knees.\u201d That kind of behavior before meeting for a first date is appalling, SR or not. \n\nI responded to \u201clook good on your knees\u201d guy with this:\n\n\u201cDiscussing sexual preferences is perfectly okay but I don\u2019t appreciate comments like that prior to a M&G. I would be happy to indulge in similar conversation with you after we are more established. I am submissive. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that I do not have boundaries. If you are able to respect them, then I think we will get along great. \ud83d\ude42\u201d\n\nHaven\u2019t heard back since. Sometimes the trash takes itself out.",

This guy was either ignorant, or worse, dangerously abusive.\n\nMost sexually submissive people are actually very strong and independent people that have the confidence to enjoy letting themselves be vulnerable to someone they TRUST.  True Dominants know they have to EARN that trust by demonstrating their concern for the safety, boundaries, well being and pleasure of the Submissive.  True Dominants gain their pleasure from gaining the trust of the Submissive as much, if not more, than from rough aggressive sex.\n\nUnfortunately, there are FALSE Dominants, that pretend to be dominant as a cover for their  abuse and misogynistic behavior.   They gain pleasure by abusing and mistreating women.  They show no concern for the safety, boundaries, well being or pleasure of the Submissive.\n\nGood for you that you recognized and didn't accept his bad behavior.  It is so important for Submissives to understand the differences between True Dominants and False Dominants and not put themselves at risk.",

Im not here to date and play guessing games because i don\u2019t have the time so I enjoy the SB\u2019s that can be on the same page like that.\n\nSome older guys might not like that if they want something more deep and thoughtful.

I\u2019m also young at 32 years old so a lot of SBs get along with me easy and I have been told refreshing.\nWith my style of relationship/arrangements, talking about money during pre and during the M&G have both been fine as everything is very casual, blunt and straight forward for me. Im not here to date and play guessing games because i don\u2019t have the time so I enjoy the SB\u2019s that can be on the same page like that.\n\nSome older guys might not like that if they want something more deep and thoughtful. Its kinda tricky. Money talk always feels weird even for me at first but its nice to finally get over that and come to an agreement with a new SB.",
