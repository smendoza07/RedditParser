Not saying Sasuke couldn\u2019t have dodged that at all but.. the fact that he was still standing after shielding Boruto and tanking hits was already impressive. 2 Otsosukis was just too much for one Sasuke. Plus Naruto and Saskue weren\u2019t teaming up like they were before. They were distracted cause Boruto was there, the other fucking kid appeared outta nowhere, they were in a time limit AND all they needed to do was survive the 5mins until ishiki died. Not only where they NOT expecting Borushiki in the first place but they weren\u2019t prepared at all. When you consider everything\u2026 it kinda makes sense just sayin.",

There was no way for anything to happen in Boruto if Naruto and Sasuke still had plot armor. They would somehow become as powerful as Kaguya and be OP forever. Kinda like real life when you get older you\u2019re more susceptible to things and the fact that in Boruto they try to make people like real life people who DO lose and DO get injured is not too bad. Kinda like Jiraiya\u2019s death. He was my favorite character, I never wanted him to die, he was MEGA OP until Pain came along. If it wasn\u2019t for his death Naruto wouldn\u2019t have become as strong as he is now. Jiraiya would\u2019ve always been there for Naruto and probably help him. It wouldn\u2019t have been the same.

Like Sasuke not being able to sense him at all until it\u2019s too late? not being able to switch places with Boruto like in this animation here? Hell not even a substitution? come on man that was some asspull writing right there.",

And for sure it left me feeling kinda sad about the Rinnegan but shit it caught me off guard. Which is exactly why I love the Naruto world.

Though extremely surprising, it\u2019s not unexpected that an OP fighter could potentially be taken out by an unsuspecting attack. And I don\u2019t think Sasuke losing one fight is enough for people to outrage and not want to watch Boruto(not saying that\u2019s you it just seems ppl hate the show Boruto for no real reason!)",

Naruto's generation never had to really be ninja, they were always more like ninja-samurai types. Always felt like that was what ANBU (and other black ops) was actually for, the \"ninja\" stuff. This isn't a bad thing because it led to Naruto being its own thing that wasn't just another ninja or whatever else manga/anime so I would even say this is a great thing.\n\n===\n\nBoruto needed to be its own thing and not try to be Naruto, it's a new generation after all. That's where Boruto comes up short, it's trying to be something that already exist while also being its own thing, of course people are going to push back against it.\n\n===\n\nIt would have been rather heart warming if Boruto and co didn't have to go through all this crap they're going through because Naruto created peace. Yeah, there's some normal ppl shit and tensions can raise, but, having the new generation not inheriting the old generation's shit was kinda the point of Naruto but that went out the window. Basically, after all the stuff Naruto and co went through, nothing has really changed... And that's depressing and shows that fate is just going to continue saying \"hey, fuck you guys\".",

The fact that the Otsosukis came outta nowhere is not exactly undermining what Naruto and Sasuke did and went through, actually it doesn\u2019t even touch their accomplishments. As far as they are concerned the real fight for them started after defeating Kaguya. Saskue went out of Konoha to explore Kaguyas ruin cause he knew something was up. People can\u2019t just take the fact that they lost one fight, they expected Sasuke and Naruto to be Demigods and that was never the case. I bet you we will get a grandson in the Naruto world. Why wouldn\u2019t we? Jojos has like 4 generations.

Oh yea a bs move by black Zetsu, you could called it a SNEAK ATTACK Madara DID NOT SEE coming despite him having all those powers. Sasuke can\u2019t use the six paths my dude. He has the Rinnegan but at no time has he ever been able to use the powers pain has. Why? Cause he doesn\u2019t have six paths power, his Rinnegan is his own Rinnegan with his own powers. In that fight with Naruto THE sage of the six paths GAVE Naruto and Sasuke some power. That\u2019s why he was able to do certain things for a little bit. That\u2019s not a plot hole it\u2019s just what\u2019s always been. Sakura as badass and strong as she can be has nothing that can work against and Otsosuki. Maybe she will survive for a long time, but win? Hell no. And I\u2019m glad you recognize the writers trying to move the show forward, tell me what would you have done? How do you take mf NARUTO out of the spotlight? Not only would fans riot if he dies but anything you choose will have negative backlash, same goes for Sasuke. My bois fought, gave it their all, believed in each other and while they lost the fight they won the battle. Idk man that\u2019s good enough for me.\nEdit:spelling",

Not only would fans riot if he dies but anything you choose will have negative backlash, same goes for Sasuke.\n\nYeah, no matter what there would be backlash, but they could have handled it better. For example the simplest of thing: sacrificing themselves. Yeah it is really simple but that's the only way to make them die while being demigods and still make sense. Imagine Boruto seeing Sasuke and Naruto sacrifice their lives to protect him or the village and the aftereffects of that. The power that kept the peace in the world would be gone, Boruto and Sarada would have to cope with the pain of a ninja, losing someone dear to them. Everything would change in the world as if a new era has began (bonus kakashi would probably retake spot as hokage or konohamaru and that would be cool to see).",

Later, he awakened his Riennegan in his 90s/100s because of the Hashirama cells he had consumed. Explain how was he able to still use the six paths abilities with just a *tiny bit* of Hashirama cells (similarly to the Six Path Sage\u2019s)? \n\nNow where more irregularity shows up is when Obito uses one of Nagato\u2019s (later we discover it\u2019s Madara\u2019s) eyes and again, he can\u2019t manage those same abilities \ud83d\udc40 It\u2019s written off as it being too overwhelming and demanding to tap into the paths. Nagato\u2019s (Madara\u2019s) eyes were transplanted, but he can use every single ability just fine? The only speculative explanation for Nagato\u2019s extensive power is that he\u2019s had decades of practice from birth, that\u2019s all.\n\nSo, Sasuke should be well capable of using six paths after practice with that same logic - even if it\u2019s just some because of his one eye. Not to mention how it\u2019s technically natural on him. Don\u2019t believe me? How in the world did Sasuke use universal pull AND planetary devastation on Naruto in the final battle then?\n\nThe writers know that giving Sasuke his **rightful** powers would make him WAY OP. Imagine Nagato, but times 1000.",

Sasuke had to pull out some alternative powers to equate to Naruto. But he was **always** beside him with a similar or equal, just as powerful, jutsu\u2026 When they attacked Obito, Sasuke wasn\u2019t lacking. And Madara, as well anyone whom they used a jutsu or physical attack on at the same time.\n\nWe can\u2019t dive too deep into this, \u201coh Sasuke is inferior, he doesn\u2019t have the chakra to use god powers\u201d\n\n*he has a large array of god powers, yet he\u2019s using the bottom tier god jutsu(s), he has enough chakra to at least use/try various jutsus.*\n\nBut we get the same thing, example rasengan. It\u2019d be nice to see a- \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve only worked on this jutsu in secret and far away, but I\u2019m ready to use it\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve only heard tales about this jutsu, but now that I\u2019ve obtained god powers, I can make the signs and use the jutsu\u201d\n\nOr, \u201che only has one arm, he\u2019s older\u201d\n\nInstead, it\u2019s all up to the writers, and assuringly the writers haven\u2019t thought of Sasuke\u2019s stamina, they just think how the battle and fighting will play out, and how it\u2019s going to end, and then how to get there.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication of the writers presenting Sasuke accurately or fairly. He was a punching bag against Momoshiki, constantly out of chakra, and Boruto actually hit him. First of all, Sasuke is on such a level, anyone that comes within a bubble he should be able to \u201cauto-sense\u201d and react. But there\u2019s no in-story explanation, it\u2019s all up to the writers and what they don\u2019t do and what they do, as well think.",

There was no way for anything to happen in Boruto if Naruto and Sasuke still had plot armor. They would somehow become as powerful as Kaguya and be OP forever. Kinda like real life when you get older you\u2019re more susceptible to things and the fact that in Boruto they try to make people like real life people who DO lose and DO get injured is not too bad. Kinda like Jiraiya\u2019s death. He was my favorite character, I never wanted him to die, he was MEGA OP until Pain came along. If it wasn\u2019t for his death Naruto wouldn\u2019t have become as strong as he is now. Jiraiya would\u2019ve always been there for Naruto and probably help him. It wouldn\u2019t have been the same.

Though extremely surprising, it\u2019s not unexpected that an OP fighter could potentially be taken out by an unsuspecting attack. And I don\u2019t think Sasuke losing one fight is enough for people to outrage and not want to watch Boruto(not saying that\u2019s you it just seems ppl hate the show Boruto for no real reason!)",

Naruto's generation never had to really be ninja, they were always more like ninja-samurai types. Always felt like that was what ANBU (and other black ops) was actually for, the \"ninja\" stuff. This isn't a bad thing because it led to Naruto being its own thing that wasn't just another ninja or whatever else manga/anime so I would even say this is a great thing.\n\n===\n\nBoruto needed to be its own thing and not try to be Naruto, it's a new generation after all.

The fact that the Otsosukis came outta nowhere is not exactly undermining what Naruto and Sasuke did and went through, actually it doesn\u2019t even touch their accomplishments.

He has the Rinnegan but at no time has he ever been able to use the powers pain has. Why? Cause he doesn\u2019t have six paths power, his Rinnegan is his own Rinnegan with his own powers.

For example the simplest of thing: sacrificing themselves. Yeah it is really simple but that's the only way to make them die while being demigods and still make sense. Imagine Boruto seeing Sasuke and Naruto sacrifice their lives to protect him or the village and the aftereffects of that. The power that kept the peace in the world would be gone, Boruto and Sarada would have to cope with the pain of a ninja, losing someone dear to them.

Later, he awakened his Riennegan in his 90s/100s because of the Hashirama cells he had consumed. Explain how was he able to still use the six paths abilities with just a *tiny bit* of Hashirama cells (similarly to the Six Path Sage\u2019s)? \n\nNow where more irregularity shows up is when Obito uses one of Nagato\u2019s (later we discover it\u2019s Madara\u2019s) eyes and again, he can\u2019t manage those same abilities \ud83d\udc40 It\u2019s written off as it being too overwhelming and demanding to tap into the paths. Nagato\u2019s (Madara\u2019s) eyes were transplanted, but he can use every single ability just fine? The only speculative explanation for Nagato\u2019s extensive power is that he\u2019s had decades of practice from birth, that\u2019s all.\n\nSo, Sasuke should be well capable of using six paths after practice with that same logic - even if it\u2019s just some because of his one eye. Not to mention how it\u2019s technically natural on him. Don\u2019t believe me? How in the world did Sasuke use universal pull AND planetary devastation on Naruto in the final battle then?\n\nThe writers know that giving Sasuke his **rightful** powers would make him WAY OP. Imagine Nagato, but times 1000.",

They were distracted cause Boruto was there, the other fucking kid appeared outta nowhere, they were in a time limit AND all they needed to do was survive the 5mins until ishiki died.

The fact that the Otsosukis came outta nowhere is not exactly undermining what Naruto and Sasuke did and went through, actually it doesn\u2019t even touch their accomplishments.

For example the simplest of thing: sacrificing themselves. Yeah it is really simple but that's the only way to make them die while being demigods and still make sense. Imagine Boruto seeing Sasuke and Naruto sacrifice their lives to protect him or the village and the aftereffects of that. The power that kept the peace in the world would be gone, Boruto and Sarada would have to cope with the pain of a ninja, losing someone dear to them. Everything would change in the world as if a new era has began (bonus kakashi would probably retake spot as hokage or konohamaru and that would be cool to see).",

The only speculative explanation for Nagato\u2019s extensive power is that he\u2019s had decades of practice from birth, that\u2019s all.\n\nSo, Sasuke should be well capable of using six paths after practice with that same logic - even if it\u2019s just some because of his one eye. Not to mention how it\u2019s technically natural on him. Don\u2019t believe me? How in the world did Sasuke use universal pull AND planetary devastation on Naruto in the final battle then?\n\nThe writers know that giving Sasuke his **rightful** powers would make him WAY OP. Imagine Nagato, but times 1000.",

And Madara, as well anyone whom they used a jutsu or physical attack on at the same time.\n\nWe can\u2019t dive too deep into this, \u201coh Sasuke is inferior, he doesn\u2019t have the chakra to use god powers\u201d\n\n*he has a large array of god powers, yet he\u2019s using the bottom tier god jutsu(s), he has enough chakra to at least use/try various jutsus.*\n\nBut we get the same thing, example rasengan. It\u2019d be nice to see a- \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve only worked on this jutsu in secret and far away, but I\u2019m ready to use it\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve only heard tales about this jutsu, but now that I\u2019ve obtained god powers, I can make the signs and use the jutsu\u201d\n\nOr, \u201che only has one arm, he\u2019s older\u201d\n\nInstead, it\u2019s all up to the writers, and assuringly the writers haven\u2019t thought of Sasuke\u2019s stamina, they just think how the battle and fighting will play out, and how it\u2019s going to end, and then how to get there.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication of the writers presenting Sasuke accurately or fairly. He was a punching bag against Momoshiki, constantly out of chakra, and Boruto actually hit him. First of all, Sasuke is on such a level, anyone that comes within a bubble he should be able to \u201cauto-sense\u201d and react.

They were distracted cause Boruto was there, the other fucking kid appeared outta nowhere, they were in a time limit AND all they needed to do was survive the 5mins until ishiki died.

And for sure it left me feeling kinda sad about the Rinnegan but shit it caught me off guard. Which is exactly why I love the Naruto world. It\u2019s highly unpredictable, sneak attacks have killed Madara, punched Kaguya, taken out Kakuzu\u2019s hearts, and defeated a byakugan wielding Neji. Though extremely surprising, it\u2019s not unexpected that an OP fighter could potentially be taken out by an unsuspecting attack. And I don\u2019t think Sasuke losing one fight is enough for people to outrage and not want to watch Boruto(not saying that\u2019s you it just seems ppl hate the show Boruto for no real reason!)",

I would\u2019ve watched that show, but imagine the people complains that they have ruined Naruto by making him old, and that they want to see him fight at his prime. I\u2019ve literally argued with Naruto fans that fillers are STILL part of the anime and while maybe not too important to the anime theres still some good episodes, what I\u2019m trying to say is that this show will not satisfy Naruto fans. The expectations are too high. Naruto set the bar for what a ninja anime should be and that bar is up in the sky. There is NEVER going to be another show like Naruto; that being said I love the show Boruto. It\u2019s a bit of slice of life, some crazy shit is happening, and all the characters that I\u2019ve always loved are there. If you hate the show cause it\u2019s progressing and now Boruto will take the spotlight then idk go watch another show, Shaman King is great too.",

Naruto's generation never had to really be ninja, they were always more like ninja-samurai types. Always felt like that was what ANBU (and other black ops) was actually for, the \"ninja\" stuff. This isn't a bad thing because it led to Naruto being its own thing that wasn't just another ninja or whatever else manga/anime so I would even say this is a great thing.\n\n===\n\nBoruto needed to be its own thing and not try to be Naruto, it's a new generation after all. That's where Boruto comes up short, it's trying to be something that already exist while also being its own thing, of course people are going to push back against it.\n\n===\n\nIt would have been rather heart warming if Boruto and co didn't have to go through all this crap they're going through because Naruto created peace. Yeah, there's some normal ppl shit and tensions can raise, but, having the new generation not inheriting the old generation's shit was kinda the point of Naruto but that went out the window. Basically, after all the stuff Naruto and co went through, nothing has really changed... And that's depressing and shows that fate is just going to continue saying \"hey, fuck you guys\".",

That there was no real fights, it would still face backlash. The fact that the Otsosukis came outta nowhere is not exactly undermining what Naruto and Sasuke did and went through, actually it doesn\u2019t even touch their accomplishments. As far as they are concerned the real fight for them started after defeating Kaguya. Saskue went out of Konoha to explore Kaguyas ruin cause he knew something was up. People can\u2019t just take the fact that they lost one fight, they expected Sasuke and Naruto to be Demigods and that was never the case. I bet you we will get a grandson in the Naruto world. Why wouldn\u2019t we? Jojos has like 4 generations. But when that comes out people will be complaining about the power scale against Boruto and how Boruto should be a demigod but is still losing some battles. Like it\u2019s just a show my dude, and we are loving it so much we are seriously arguing about it like politics.

Also when Madara came back as was ultra powered and was the 10 tails jinjuriki,  how was he taken out? Oh yea a bs move by black Zetsu, you could called it a SNEAK ATTACK Madara DID NOT SEE coming despite him having all those powers. Sasuke can\u2019t use the six paths my dude. He has the Rinnegan but at no time has he ever been able to use the powers pain has. Why? Cause he doesn\u2019t have six paths power, his Rinnegan is his own Rinnegan with his own powers. In that fight with Naruto THE sage of the six paths GAVE Naruto and Sasuke some power. That\u2019s why he was able to do certain things for a little bit. That\u2019s not a plot hole it\u2019s just what\u2019s always been. Sakura as badass and strong as she can be has nothing that can work against and Otsosuki. Maybe she will survive for a long time, but win? Hell no. And I\u2019m glad you recognize the writers trying to move the show forward, tell me what would you have done? How do you take mf NARUTO out of the spotlight? Not only would fans riot if he dies but anything you choose will have negative backlash, same goes for Sasuke.

For example the simplest of thing: sacrificing themselves. Yeah it is really simple but that's the only way to make them die while being demigods and still make sense. Imagine Boruto seeing Sasuke and Naruto sacrifice their lives to protect him or the village and the aftereffects of that. The power that kept the peace in the world would be gone, Boruto and Sarada would have to cope with the pain of a ninja, losing someone dear to them. Everything would change in the world as if a new era has began (bonus kakashi would probably retake spot as hokage or konohamaru and that would be cool to see).",

Later, he awakened his Riennegan in his 90s/100s because of the Hashirama cells he had consumed. Explain how was he able to still use the six paths abilities with just a *tiny bit* of Hashirama cells (similarly to the Six Path Sage\u2019s)? \n\nNow where more irregularity shows up is when Obito uses one of Nagato\u2019s (later we discover it\u2019s Madara\u2019s) eyes and again, he can\u2019t manage those same abilities \ud83d\udc40 It\u2019s written off as it being too overwhelming and demanding to tap into the paths. Nagato\u2019s (Madara\u2019s) eyes were transplanted, but he can use every single ability just fine? The only speculative explanation for Nagato\u2019s extensive power is that he\u2019s had decades of practice from birth, that\u2019s all.\n\nSo, Sasuke should be well capable of using six paths after practice with that same logic - even if it\u2019s just some because of his one eye. Not to mention how it\u2019s technically natural on him. Don\u2019t believe me? How in the world did Sasuke use universal pull AND planetary devastation on Naruto in the final battle then?\n\nThe writers know that giving Sasuke his **rightful** powers would make him WAY OP.

He was a punching bag against Momoshiki, constantly out of chakra, and Boruto actually hit him.

You can have it where these stories are being told to Boruto/others as a means to impress/connect with them but the older generation is out of touch.

Naruto's generation never had to really be ninja, they were always more like ninja-samurai types. Always felt like that was what ANBU (and other black ops) was actually for, the \"ninja\" stuff. This isn't a bad thing because it led to Naruto being its own thing that wasn't just another ninja or whatever else manga/anime so I would even say this is a great thing.\n\n===\n\nBoruto needed to be its own thing and not try to be Naruto, it's a new generation after all. That's where Boruto comes up short, it's trying to be something that already exist while also being its own thing, of course people are going to push back against it.\n\n===\n\nIt would have been rather heart warming if Boruto and co didn't have to go through all this crap they're going through because Naruto created peace. Yeah, there's some normal ppl shit and tensions can raise, but, having the new generation not inheriting the old generation's shit was kinda the point of Naruto but that went out the window. Basically, after all the stuff Naruto and co went through, nothing has really changed... And that's depressing and shows that fate is just going to continue saying \"hey, fuck you guys\".",

That there was no real fights, it would still face backlash. The fact that the Otsosukis came outta nowhere is not exactly undermining what Naruto and Sasuke did and went through, actually it doesn\u2019t even touch their accomplishments. As far as they are concerned the real fight for them started after defeating Kaguya. Saskue went out of Konoha to explore Kaguyas ruin cause he knew something was up. People can\u2019t just take the fact that they lost one fight, they expected Sasuke and Naruto to be Demigods and that was never the case. I bet you we will get a grandson in the Naruto world. Why wouldn\u2019t we? Jojos has like 4 generations. But when that comes out people will be complaining about the power scale against Boruto and how Boruto should be a demigod but is still losing some battles. Like it\u2019s just a show my dude, and we are loving it so much we are seriously arguing about it like politics.

Not only would fans riot if he dies but anything you choose will have negative backlash, same goes for Sasuke.\n\nYeah, no matter what there would be backlash, but they could have handled it better. For example the simplest of thing: sacrificing themselves. Yeah it is really simple but that's the only way to make them die while being demigods and still make sense. Imagine Boruto seeing Sasuke and Naruto sacrifice their lives to protect him or the village and the aftereffects of that. The power that kept the peace in the world would be gone, Boruto and Sarada would have to cope with the pain of a ninja, losing someone dear to them. Everything would change in the world as if a new era has began (bonus kakashi would probably retake spot as hokage or konohamaru and that would be cool to see).",

Later, he awakened his Riennegan in his 90s/100s because of the Hashirama cells he had consumed. Explain how was he able to still use the six paths abilities with just a *tiny bit* of Hashirama cells (similarly to the Six Path Sage\u2019s)? \n\nNow where more irregularity shows up is when Obito uses one of Nagato\u2019s (later we discover it\u2019s Madara\u2019s) eyes and again, he can\u2019t manage those same abilities \ud83d\udc40 It\u2019s written off as it being too overwhelming and demanding to tap into the paths. Nagato\u2019s (Madara\u2019s) eyes were transplanted, but he can use every single ability just fine? The only speculative explanation for Nagato\u2019s extensive power is that he\u2019s had decades of practice from birth, that\u2019s all.\n\nSo, Sasuke should be well capable of using six paths after practice with that same logic - even if it\u2019s just some because of his one eye. Not to mention how it\u2019s technically natural on him. Don\u2019t believe me? How in the world did Sasuke use universal pull AND planetary devastation on Naruto in the final battle then?\n\nThe writers know that giving Sasuke his **rightful** powers would make him WAY OP.

That there was no real fights, it would still face backlash. The fact that the Otsosukis came outta nowhere is not exactly undermining what Naruto and Sasuke did and went through, actually it doesn\u2019t even touch their accomplishments. As far as they are concerned the real fight for them started after defeating Kaguya. Saskue went out of Konoha to explore Kaguyas ruin cause he knew something was up. People can\u2019t just take the fact that they lost one fight, they expected Sasuke and Naruto to be Demigods and that was never the case. I bet you we will get a grandson in the Naruto world. Why wouldn\u2019t we? Jojos has like 4 generations. But when that comes out people will be complaining about the power scale against Boruto and how Boruto should be a demigod but is still losing some battles. Like it\u2019s just a show my dude, and we are loving it so much we are seriously arguing about it like politics. Say what you say but truth is, that shit was unexpected and well executed and I\u2019m gonna keep watching more.",
