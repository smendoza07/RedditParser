It was likely Obito's plan to rely primarily on infiltration tactics, and the fact that all the villages would be fighting together for the first time would make it even easier for Zetsu to fool people. Nobody wants to make waves by accusing the random guy from another village of being an imposter; and Zetsu needs to fool comparatively fewer enemies in any given squad if most of them haven't even lived in the same village as the disguise being used. \n\nAnd Zetsu doesn't need to win the war, just stall the armies long enough for Obito and Sasuke (who Obito had been trying to recruit) to capture Naruto and Bee. Without Naruto and the resurrected Kage working together, the allied Shinobi forces would have been crushed by the 10 tails. \n\nWorst case scenario for Obito is to give Sasuke the Rinnegan and trick him into using rinne rebirth to resurrect Madara. That was the original plan for Nagato according to Madara and Obito, and Obito could probably convince Sasuke to do something similar if it meant destroying the Leaf (remember he only decided to give the Leaf a chance after seeing the resurrected Itachi).",

He wanted to wipe out Konoha, as in its people and particularly its government and shinobi.\n\nObito thought he was using Sasuke but was he really? Sasuke stayed with him to achieve his own goals, not to achieve Obitos.\n\nIf Sasuke is joining the war who else is he fighting? In this scenario there\u2019s no edo so at this point the entire war is fighting obito and the tailed beasts and his zetsu \n\nI hiiiiighly doubt that Sasuke joins the fight on the opposing team and doesn\u2019t go up against Naruto, his teammate, his closest bond in life and his bitter rival. Even if he\u2019s not going toe to toe directly with Naruto it\u2019s highly unlikely Naruto won\u2019t see his eyes once. There\u2019s also no scenario in which Sasuke joins the fight for obito and Naruto doesn\u2019t force Sasuke to be his opponent so he can fight him and try to talk no Jutsu him.\n\nYeah 5 bijus, with one of the two that\u2019s missing being the 1 tails (weakest tailed beast presumably) \n\n1) So the additional tailed beast is going to be enough to overpower Kurama? What if Kurama is joined by Gyuki? Unlikely..\n\n2) covered in my point 1\n\n3) Obito going easy on Naruto is a weak argument\n\n4) Naruto\u2019s avatar state has a time limit but that doesn\u2019t mean he can only fight tailed beasts in the avatar state, he can still combat them in just his Kurama chakra mode \n\n5)  The biju do not have limitless chakra btw even in their natural state\n\n6) Kakashi would\u2019ve spammed all his Jutsu far less if he hadn\u2019t spent the past 2 days fighting Edo opponents like the 7 swordsmen of the mist \n\n8) again wild bijuus do not have limitless chakra, 3rd Raikage was able to battle Gyuki to exhaustion\n\n8) The five kage definitely are not garbage, I agree orange mask Obito could solo them, if not aided by Kakashi, Guy, Naruto etc. and they\u2019re at least nearing tailed beast levels so that\u2019s like having an additional couple of tailed beasts on the alliance side \n\nYou\u2019re acting like base Obito is as capable of removing Kakashis eye as easily as 10 tails Madara removes a much more fatigued Kakashis eye. It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back",

Even at VOTE\n\n\n\n>In this scenario there\u2019s no edo so at this point the entire war is fighting obito and the tailed beasts and his zetsu \n\nObviously \n\n>I hiiiiighly doubt that Sasuke joins the fight on the opposing team and doesn\u2019t go up against Naruto, his teammate, his closest bond in life and his bitter rival. Even if he\u2019s not going toe to toe directly with Naruto it\u2019s highly unlikely Naruto won\u2019t see his eyes once. There\u2019s also no scenario in which Sasuke joins the fight for obito and Naruto doesn\u2019t force Sasuke to be his opponent so he can fight him and try to talk no Jutsu him.\n\nIt's okay, Sasuke can obito to fight against Naruto.\n\nSo the crow would come out of naruto and put Sasuke in a genjutsu.\n\nObiot would immediately recognize the crow and steal shisui's eye.\n\nNow obito has Kotoamatsukami GG\n\n\n>Yeah 5 bijus, with one of the two that\u2019s missing being the 1 tails (weakest tailed beast presumably) \n\nHeadcanon.\n\nAll bijjus have shown the same destructive capacity.\n\nAlso, you're underestimating shukaku.\n\nHe has Magnet sealing jutsu also.\n\n\n>1) So the additional tailed beast is going to be enough to overpower Kurama? What if Kurama is joined by Gyuki? Unlikely..\n\nKurama had a time limit and so does guyki. \n\nThey can't continuously fire biju bombs bc they are jinchurikis.\n\n\n>2) covered in my point 1\n\nCovered what?\n\nI stated that obito can use all seven bijus and stated by kakashi.\n\n3) Obito going easy on Naruto is a weak argument\n\nIt's a [Fact](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0571-011.png)\n\nIf obito goes out from the beginning, they have no chance.\n\nHe instantly Summons 7 bijuus and makes them spam bijuu bombs.\n\n>4) Naruto\u2019s avatar state has a time limit but that doesn\u2019t mean he can only fight tailed beasts in the avatar state, he can still combat them in just his Kurama chakra mode \n\nAre you serious?\n\nKcm mode against giant bijuus?\n\nObito by himself was bullying kcm naruto with a gunbai in a 4v1 lmao\n\n[Here](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0595-016.png)\n\n\n>5)  The biju do not have limitless chakra btw even in their natural state\n\nThe Bijuus are chakra itself. They have endless chakra otherwise they would just disappear into the wind after \"running out of chakra\"\n\n>6) Kakashi would\u2019ve spammed all his Jutsu far less if he hadn\u2019t spent the past 2 days fighting Edo opponents like the 7 swordsmen of the mist \n\nAnd obito would've shown up with all 7 bijuus fully transformed ready to spam biju bombs or super biju bombs.\n\nRemember, obito can teleport too with kamui.\n\nSo he can just go to different battle fields and blow them up like [this](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0572-002.png)\n\n\n>8) again wild bijuus do not have limitless chakra, \n\nYes they do bc they are chakra itself\n\n\n>3rd Raikage was able to battle Gyuki to exhaustion\n\nLmao\n\n3rd raikage physically fought gyuki to a standstill.\n\nStamina \u2260 chakra\n\nAre you telling me anyone besides 8th gate guy can wrestle 7 bijuus?\n\n8) The five kage definitely are not garbage, \n\nThey are against obito.\n\n>I agree orange mask Obito could solo them, if not aided by Kakashi, Guy, Naruto etc. and they\u2019re at least nearing tailed beast levels so that\u2019s like having an additional couple of tailed beasts on the alliance side.\n\n\nCouple of tailed beasts?\n\nDo you know the destructive powers of a tailed beast?\n\n5 kage don't have the fire power to match them\n\n\n>You\u2019re acting like base Obito is as capable of removing Kakashis eye as easily as 10 tails Madara removes a much more fatigued Kakashis eye. \n\nYes he can, kakashi wouldn't know or see it coming.\nHe can teleport with kamui too or use izanagi since eyes can be used like USB.\n\n\n>It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, \n\nLmaooo\n\nHe was 4v1 against them and they could never touch him from the real world.\n\nHe won't be trying to wrap them since he is going all out here.\n\nHe will use the black rods supplemented with kamui intangibility to immobilize them.\n\n>including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, \n\nOMG lmfaooo\n\nHow do you move at \"near FTG speed?\"\n\nFTG is instantaneous. There is no speed.\n\nAre you telling me Naruto can move \"near\" instantaneous speed?\n\n\n>Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back\n\nYes he will when he knows he needs.\n\nWhy don't you make a counter to him after he takes his eye back?",

Then during the kage summit, instead of just talking to Naruto at the hotel, Obito could\u2019ve easily captured him, that would be the final piece of the puzzle and the ten tails would be revived without any war or any real opposition.

Unfortunately for Tobi, Bee tricked Sasuke, and Pain sacrificed himself for Naruto so he went from thinking he had it all to wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nTobi at the hotel is certainly an interesting one because yes he could have captured Naruto and ended it there but I think his curiosity to find out what happened with Nagato prevented him from picking a fight. Also, I don't think with Kakashi and Yamato there along with Naruto, Tobi could have won that fight. \n\nBut even prior to the war declaration, they had resolved to create a defensive force. A lot of the bad stuff at the meeting was caused by in-fighting on who should be the leader due to general distrust. Now where I'll agree with you is that Tobi's war declaration shut down all that distrust and helped unify the Kage much faster.\n\nBut I think by that point Tobi saw the war as inevitable so he had the change in strategy with Kisame being sent not to capture Killer Bee but rather spy on the Cloud Village. Hence why he let it \"slip\" that Bee was still alive. He guessed correctly that the jinchuricki would be kept from fighting and while the bulk of the shinobi force was fighting him then it would be much easier for Kisame to hunt down the remaining two jinchuricki, especially when they were on the same island.",

If he had gone with Sasuke or even just sent Kisame along, they would\u2019ve captured Bee with no difficulty. Especially considering this happened after the failed capturing of Naruto by Pain, he should\u2019ve known not to take dumb chances. \n\nNow if we address the hotel situation, for starters Obito doesn\u2019t need to kill all three of them or even really fight that much, he just needs to catch Naruto, and since he was able to get alone in a room with Naruto that really shouldn\u2019t have been a problem, but even if it turned into a fight I don\u2019t see the three of them beating Obito at all. As for the Nagato thing, if Obito genjutsu\u2019d Naruto and took him to the kamui dimension, he could\u2019ve forced Naruto to tell him anything he wanted to know. Naruto at the time also is not partnered with Kurama at all and has no access to his chakra beyond raging, and Obito was capable of controlling a perfect jinchuuriki for years on end with genjutsu. \n\nAs for the alliance, whether they agreed to the alliance or not that day it really doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference since while the kage were having their meeting and bickering amongst themselves, Obito could\u2019ve been at the hotel, solo, capturing the final piece to the puzzle and essentially winning the war before it even started. \n\nThere\u2019s no good reason why he couldn\u2019t have captured bee and Naruto with very little effort.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think Obito could\u2019ve beaten pre war Naruto and Kakashi and Yamato at once (which I strongly disagree with) he still could\u2019ve shown up with Kisame and then there\u2019s absolutely no way of N+K+Y beating them.",

Remember the Cloud Village shinobi came to the Leaf when it was rebuilding. So I still think Tobi had confidence in his subordinates to take care of business on their own.\n\nAlso, one thing I think you're overlooking is that Tobi is not Obito. Rather he is Obito's projection of Madara. Meaning his personality reflects Madara more than it does Obito. During the War, we see that Obito is very much goal-driven and constantly gets frustrated at the fact that things are taking too long. Meanwhile, Madara wants to achieve the IT but he also loves dicking around and feels he can accomplish the goal any time he wants.\n\nAnd we see that in Tobi. Tobi is goal-driven but he has time to mess around. Even when things don't go his way he has the confidence that things will end up fine. He regards the world as his plaything and takes great joy in tinkering around with it. There is also Madara's patented arrogance as we see with his war declaration.\n\n\nAlso I think you're underestimating the tag team of Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. I'm not saying they win but it's a tough fight because Naruto has Sage Mode and Kakashi would figure out how Kamui worked during the fight.",

The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

Nobody wants to make waves by accusing the random guy from another village of being an imposter; and Zetsu needs to fool comparatively fewer enemies in any given squad if most of them haven't even lived in the same village as the disguise being used. \n\nAnd Zetsu doesn't need to win the war, just stall the armies long enough for Obito and Sasuke (who Obito had been trying to recruit) to capture Naruto and Bee. Without Naruto and the resurrected Kage working together, the allied Shinobi forces would have been crushed by the 10 tails. \n\nWorst case scenario for Obito is to give Sasuke the Rinnegan and trick him into using rinne rebirth to resurrect Madara. That was the original plan for Nagato according to Madara and Obito, and Obito could probably convince Sasuke to do something similar if it meant destroying the Leaf (remember he only decided to give the Leaf a chance after seeing the resurrected Itachi).",

Unfortunately for Tobi, Bee tricked Sasuke, and Pain sacrificed himself for Naruto so he went from thinking he had it all to wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nTobi at the hotel is certainly an interesting one because yes he could have captured Naruto and ended it there but I think his curiosity to find out what happened with Nagato prevented him from picking a fight. Also, I don't think with Kakashi and Yamato there along with Naruto, Tobi could have won that fight. \n\nBut even prior to the war declaration, they had resolved to create a defensive force. A lot of the bad stuff at the meeting was caused by in-fighting on who should be the leader due to general distrust. Now where I'll agree with you is that Tobi's war declaration shut down all that distrust and helped unify the Kage much faster.\n\nBut I think by that point Tobi saw the war as inevitable so he had the change in strategy with Kisame being sent not to capture Killer Bee but rather spy on the Cloud Village. Hence why he let it \"slip\" that Bee was still alive. He guessed correctly that the jinchuricki would be kept from fighting and while the bulk of the shinobi force was fighting him then it would be much easier for Kisame to hunt down the remaining two jinchuricki, especially when they were on the same island.",

If he had gone with Sasuke or even just sent Kisame along, they would\u2019ve captured Bee with no difficulty. Especially considering this happened after the failed capturing of Naruto by Pain, he should\u2019ve known not to take dumb chances. \n\nNow if we address the hotel situation, for starters Obito doesn\u2019t need to kill all three of them or even really fight that much, he just needs to catch Naruto, and since he was able to get alone in a room with Naruto that really shouldn\u2019t have been a problem, but even if it turned into a fight I don\u2019t see the three of them beating Obito at all. As for the Nagato thing, if Obito genjutsu\u2019d Naruto and took him to the kamui dimension, he could\u2019ve forced Naruto to tell him anything he wanted to know. Naruto at the time also is not partnered with Kurama at all and has no access to his chakra beyond raging, and Obito was capable of controlling a perfect jinchuuriki for years on end with genjutsu. \n\nAs for the alliance, whether they agreed to the alliance or not that day it really doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference since while the kage were having their meeting and bickering amongst themselves, Obito could\u2019ve been at the hotel, solo, capturing the final piece to the puzzle and essentially winning the war before it even started. \n\nThere\u2019s no good reason why he couldn\u2019t have captured bee and Naruto with very little effort.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think Obito could\u2019ve beaten pre war Naruto and Kakashi and Yamato at once (which I strongly disagree with) he still could\u2019ve shown up with Kisame and then there\u2019s absolutely no way of N+K+Y beating them.",

So I still think Tobi had confidence in his subordinates to take care of business on their own.\n\nAlso, one thing I think you're overlooking is that Tobi is not Obito. Rather he is Obito's projection of Madara. Meaning his personality reflects Madara more than it does Obito. During the War, we see that Obito is very much goal-driven and constantly gets frustrated at the fact that things are taking too long. Meanwhile, Madara wants to achieve the IT but he also loves dicking around and feels he can accomplish the goal any time he wants.\n\nAnd we see that in Tobi. Tobi is goal-driven but he has time to mess around. Even when things don't go his way he has the confidence that things will end up fine. He regards the world as his plaything and takes great joy in tinkering around with it. There is also Madara's patented arrogance as we see with his war declaration.\n\n\nAlso I think you're underestimating the tag team of Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. I'm not saying they win but it's a tough fight because Naruto has Sage Mode and Kakashi would figure out how Kamui worked during the fight.",

The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

It was likely Obito's plan to rely primarily on infiltration tactics, and the fact that all the villages would be fighting together for the first time would make it even easier for Zetsu to fool people. Nobody wants to make waves by accusing the random guy from another village of being an imposter; and Zetsu needs to fool comparatively fewer enemies in any given squad if most of them haven't even lived in the same village as the disguise being used. \n\nAnd Zetsu doesn't need to win the war, just stall the armies long enough for Obito and Sasuke (who Obito had been trying to recruit) to capture Naruto and Bee. Without Naruto and the resurrected Kage working together, the allied Shinobi forces would have been crushed by the 10 tails. \n\nWorst case scenario for Obito is to give Sasuke the Rinnegan and trick him into using rinne rebirth to resurrect Madara. That was the original plan for Nagato according to Madara and Obito, and Obito could probably convince Sasuke to do something similar if it meant destroying the Leaf (remember he only decided to give the Leaf a chance after seeing the resurrected Itachi).",

It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back",

They have endless chakra otherwise they would just disappear into the wind after \"running out of chakra\"\n\n>6) Kakashi would\u2019ve spammed all his Jutsu far less if he hadn\u2019t spent the past 2 days fighting Edo opponents like the 7 swordsmen of the mist \n\nAnd obito would've shown up with all 7 bijuus fully transformed ready to spam biju bombs or super biju bombs.\n\nRemember, obito can teleport too with kamui.\n\nSo he can just go to different battle fields and blow them up like [this](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0572-002.png)\n\n\n>8) again wild bijuus do not have limitless chakra, \n\nYes they do bc they are chakra itself\n\n\n>3rd Raikage was able to battle Gyuki to exhaustion\n\nLmao\n\n3rd raikage physically fought gyuki to a standstill.\n\nStamina \u2260 chakra\n\nAre you telling me anyone besides 8th gate guy can wrestle 7 bijuus?\n\n8) The five kage definitely are not garbage, \n\nThey are against obito.\n\n>I agree orange mask Obito could solo them, if not aided by Kakashi, Guy, Naruto etc. and they\u2019re at least nearing tailed beast levels so that\u2019s like having an additional couple of tailed beasts on the alliance side.\n\n\nCouple of tailed beasts?\n\nDo you know the destructive powers of a tailed beast?\n\n5 kage don't have the fire power to match them\n\n\n>You\u2019re acting like base Obito is as capable of removing Kakashis eye as easily as 10 tails Madara removes a much more fatigued Kakashis eye. \n\nYes he can, kakashi wouldn't know or see it coming.\nHe can teleport with kamui too or use izanagi since eyes can be used like USB.\n\n\n>It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, \n\nLmaooo\n\nHe was 4v1 against them and they could never touch him from the real world.\n\nHe won't be trying to wrap them since he is going all out here.\n\nHe will use the black rods supplemented with kamui intangibility to immobilize them.\n\n>including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, \n\nOMG lmfaooo\n\nHow do you move at \"near FTG speed?\"\n\nFTG is instantaneous. There is no speed.\n\nAre you telling me Naruto can move \"near\" instantaneous speed?\n\n\n>Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back\n\nYes he will when he knows he needs.\n\nWhy don't you make a counter to him after he takes his eye back?",

Unfortunately for Tobi, Bee tricked Sasuke, and Pain sacrificed himself for Naruto so he went from thinking he had it all to wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nTobi at the hotel is certainly an interesting one because yes he could have captured Naruto and ended it there but I think his curiosity to find out what happened with Nagato prevented him from picking a fight. Also, I don't think with Kakashi and Yamato there along with Naruto, Tobi could have won that fight. \n\nBut even prior to the war declaration, they had resolved to create a defensive force. A lot of the bad stuff at the meeting was caused by in-fighting on who should be the leader due to general distrust. Now where I'll agree with you is that Tobi's war declaration shut down all that distrust and helped unify the Kage much faster.\n\nBut I think by that point Tobi saw the war as inevitable so he had the change in strategy with Kisame being sent not to capture Killer Bee but rather spy on the Cloud Village. Hence why he let it \"slip\" that Bee was still alive. He guessed correctly that the jinchuricki would be kept from fighting and while the bulk of the shinobi force was fighting him then it would be much easier for Kisame to hunt down the remaining two jinchuricki, especially when they were on the same island.",

If he had gone with Sasuke or even just sent Kisame along, they would\u2019ve captured Bee with no difficulty. Especially considering this happened after the failed capturing of Naruto by Pain, he should\u2019ve known not to take dumb chances. \n\nNow if we address the hotel situation, for starters Obito doesn\u2019t need to kill all three of them or even really fight that much, he just needs to catch Naruto, and since he was able to get alone in a room with Naruto that really shouldn\u2019t have been a problem, but even if it turned into a fight I don\u2019t see the three of them beating Obito at all. As for the Nagato thing, if Obito genjutsu\u2019d Naruto and took him to the kamui dimension, he could\u2019ve forced Naruto to tell him anything he wanted to know. Naruto at the time also is not partnered with Kurama at all and has no access to his chakra beyond raging, and Obito was capable of controlling a perfect jinchuuriki for years on end with genjutsu. \n\nAs for the alliance, whether they agreed to the alliance or not that day it really doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference since while the kage were having their meeting and bickering amongst themselves, Obito could\u2019ve been at the hotel, solo, capturing the final piece to the puzzle and essentially winning the war before it even started. \n\nThere\u2019s no good reason why he couldn\u2019t have captured bee and Naruto with very little effort.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think Obito could\u2019ve beaten pre war Naruto and Kakashi and Yamato at once (which I strongly disagree with) he still could\u2019ve shown up with Kisame and then there\u2019s absolutely no way of N+K+Y beating them.",

So I still think Tobi had confidence in his subordinates to take care of business on their own.\n\nAlso, one thing I think you're overlooking is that Tobi is not Obito. Rather he is Obito's projection of Madara. Meaning his personality reflects Madara more than it does Obito. During the War, we see that Obito is very much goal-driven and constantly gets frustrated at the fact that things are taking too long. Meanwhile, Madara wants to achieve the IT but he also loves dicking around and feels he can accomplish the goal any time he wants.\n\nAnd we see that in Tobi. Tobi is goal-driven but he has time to mess around. Even when things don't go his way he has the confidence that things will end up fine. He regards the world as his plaything and takes great joy in tinkering around with it. There is also Madara's patented arrogance as we see with his war declaration.\n\n\nAlso I think you're underestimating the tag team of Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. I'm not saying they win but it's a tough fight because Naruto has Sage Mode and Kakashi would figure out how Kamui worked during the fight.",

The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

It was likely Obito's plan to rely primarily on infiltration tactics, and the fact that all the villages would be fighting together for the first time would make it even easier for Zetsu to fool people. Nobody wants to make waves by accusing the random guy from another village of being an imposter; and Zetsu needs to fool comparatively fewer enemies in any given squad if most of them haven't even lived in the same village as the disguise being used. \n\nAnd Zetsu doesn't need to win the war, just stall the armies long enough for Obito and Sasuke (who Obito had been trying to recruit) to capture Naruto and Bee. Without Naruto and the resurrected Kage working together, the allied Shinobi forces would have been crushed by the 10 tails. \n\nWorst case scenario for Obito is to give Sasuke the Rinnegan and trick him into using rinne rebirth to resurrect Madara. That was the original plan for Nagato according to Madara and Obito, and Obito could probably convince Sasuke to do something similar if it meant destroying the Leaf (remember he only decided to give the Leaf a chance after seeing the resurrected Itachi).",

Unfortunately for Tobi, Bee tricked Sasuke, and Pain sacrificed himself for Naruto so he went from thinking he had it all to wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nTobi at the hotel is certainly an interesting one because yes he could have captured Naruto and ended it there but I think his curiosity to find out what happened with Nagato prevented him from picking a fight. Also, I don't think with Kakashi and Yamato there along with Naruto, Tobi could have won that fight. \n\nBut even prior to the war declaration, they had resolved to create a defensive force. A lot of the bad stuff at the meeting was caused by in-fighting on who should be the leader due to general distrust. Now where I'll agree with you is that Tobi's war declaration shut down all that distrust and helped unify the Kage much faster.\n\nBut I think by that point Tobi saw the war as inevitable so he had the change in strategy with Kisame being sent not to capture Killer Bee but rather spy on the Cloud Village. Hence why he let it \"slip\" that Bee was still alive. He guessed correctly that the jinchuricki would be kept from fighting and while the bulk of the shinobi force was fighting him then it would be much easier for Kisame to hunt down the remaining two jinchuricki, especially when they were on the same island.",

If he had gone with Sasuke or even just sent Kisame along, they would\u2019ve captured Bee with no difficulty. Especially considering this happened after the failed capturing of Naruto by Pain, he should\u2019ve known not to take dumb chances. \n\nNow if we address the hotel situation, for starters Obito doesn\u2019t need to kill all three of them or even really fight that much, he just needs to catch Naruto, and since he was able to get alone in a room with Naruto that really shouldn\u2019t have been a problem, but even if it turned into a fight I don\u2019t see the three of them beating Obito at all. As for the Nagato thing, if Obito genjutsu\u2019d Naruto and took him to the kamui dimension, he could\u2019ve forced Naruto to tell him anything he wanted to know. Naruto at the time also is not partnered with Kurama at all and has no access to his chakra beyond raging, and Obito was capable of controlling a perfect jinchuuriki for years on end with genjutsu. \n\nAs for the alliance, whether they agreed to the alliance or not that day it really doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference since while the kage were having their meeting and bickering amongst themselves, Obito could\u2019ve been at the hotel, solo, capturing the final piece to the puzzle and essentially winning the war before it even started. \n\nThere\u2019s no good reason why he couldn\u2019t have captured bee and Naruto with very little effort.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think Obito could\u2019ve beaten pre war Naruto and Kakashi and Yamato at once (which I strongly disagree with) he still could\u2019ve shown up with Kisame and then there\u2019s absolutely no way of N+K+Y beating them.",

So I still think Tobi had confidence in his subordinates to take care of business on their own.\n\nAlso, one thing I think you're overlooking is that Tobi is not Obito. Rather he is Obito's projection of Madara. Meaning his personality reflects Madara more than it does Obito. During the War, we see that Obito is very much goal-driven and constantly gets frustrated at the fact that things are taking too long. Meanwhile, Madara wants to achieve the IT but he also loves dicking around and feels he can accomplish the goal any time he wants.\n\nAnd we see that in Tobi. Tobi is goal-driven but he has time to mess around. Even when things don't go his way he has the confidence that things will end up fine. He regards the world as his plaything and takes great joy in tinkering around with it. There is also Madara's patented arrogance as we see with his war declaration.\n\n\nAlso I think you're underestimating the tag team of Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. I'm not saying they win but it's a tough fight because Naruto has Sage Mode and Kakashi would figure out how Kamui worked during the fight.",

The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

That was just 5 bijuus\n\n2. Obito can use 7 bijuus as stated by Kakashi that he was perfectly controlling 7 bijuus\n\n3. Obito was going easy on Naruto, he didn't except him to exceed his expectations.\n\n4. Naruto\u2019s kurama avatar has a time limit as stated the kurama himself. The bijuus obito uses do not.\n\n5. Kurama can run out of chakra while the Bijuu cannot bc they are chakra itself.\n\n6. Kakashi started to die by spamming kamui in the war.\n\n7. Guyki also reached his limit bc he was also a jinchuriki unlike wild bijuus obito was controlling.\n\n8. The 5 kahe are garbage. Orange Mask obito can solo them.\n\n>Realistically wtf would they even do about Guy turning 8 gates lol? He could just enter the 8th gate and kill the 7 tailed beasts, and then what does Obito have? 1 MS, a rinnegan and 100K weak ass zetsu clones? \n\nGuy uses 8 gates and kills all 7 bijuus.\n\nObito then realizes he has to need for the Rinnegan since the bijuus are gone.\n\nObito then takes his eye back from kakashi just like madara.\n\nThen it really is game over.\n\nDMS Obito GG\n\n\n>Without the Edo Obito had absolutely zero hopes of winning the war.\n\nHe still would've won.",

If he had gone with Sasuke or even just sent Kisame along, they would\u2019ve captured Bee with no difficulty. Especially considering this happened after the failed capturing of Naruto by Pain, he should\u2019ve known not to take dumb chances. \n\nNow if we address the hotel situation, for starters Obito doesn\u2019t need to kill all three of them or even really fight that much, he just needs to catch Naruto, and since he was able to get alone in a room with Naruto that really shouldn\u2019t have been a problem, but even if it turned into a fight I don\u2019t see the three of them beating Obito at all. As for the Nagato thing, if Obito genjutsu\u2019d Naruto and took him to the kamui dimension, he could\u2019ve forced Naruto to tell him anything he wanted to know. Naruto at the time also is not partnered with Kurama at all and has no access to his chakra beyond raging, and Obito was capable of controlling a perfect jinchuuriki for years on end with genjutsu. \n\nAs for the alliance, whether they agreed to the alliance or not that day it really doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference since while the kage were having their meeting and bickering amongst themselves, Obito could\u2019ve been at the hotel, solo, capturing the final piece to the puzzle and essentially winning the war before it even started. \n\nThere\u2019s no good reason why he couldn\u2019t have captured bee and Naruto with very little effort.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think Obito could\u2019ve beaten pre war Naruto and Kakashi and Yamato at once (which I strongly disagree with) he still could\u2019ve shown up with Kisame and then there\u2019s absolutely no way of N+K+Y beating them.",

                    "body": "Sasuke going after Bee happened prior to Pain going after Naruto. Remember the Cloud Village shinobi came to the Leaf when it was rebuilding. So I still think Tobi had confidence in his subordinates to take care of business on their own.\n\nAlso, one thing I think you're overlooking is that Tobi is not Obito. Rather he is Obito's projection of Madara. Meaning his personality reflects Madara more than it does Obito. During the War, we see that Obito is very much goal-driven and constantly gets frustrated at the fact that things are taking too long. Meanwhile, Madara wants to achieve the IT but he also loves dicking around and feels he can accomplish the goal any time he wants.\n\nAnd we see that in Tobi. Tobi is goal-driven but he has time to mess around. Even when things don't go his way he has the confidence that things will end up fine. He regards the world as his plaything and takes great joy in tinkering around with it. There is also Madara's patented arrogance as we see with his war declaration.\n\n\nAlso I think you're underestimating the tag team of Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. I'm not saying they win but it's a tough fight because Naruto has Sage Mode and Kakashi would figure out how Kamui worked during the fight.",

The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

The edo army caused so much trouble for alliance. Without Edo Madara, obito would\u2019ve been stuck fighting all 5 kage, and the thousands of shinobi Madara wrecked. Plus the shinobi killed by the revived Kage etc.\n\nBut most of all they\u2019d never have revived the ten tails since they couldn\u2019t capture Naruto quickly enough so they resorted to extracting ninetails chakra from the edo gold and silver brothers.\n\nKabuto\u2019s Edo summons probably made up more than 50% of their army\u2019s total battle power, and even with 100% of their battle power they just barely won.",

So I still think Tobi had confidence in his subordinates to take care of business on their own.\n\nAlso, one thing I think you're overlooking is that Tobi is not Obito. Rather he is Obito's projection of Madara. Meaning his personality reflects Madara more than it does Obito. During the War, we see that Obito is very much goal-driven and constantly gets frustrated at the fact that things are taking too long. Meanwhile, Madara wants to achieve the IT but he also loves dicking around and feels he can accomplish the goal any time he wants.\n\nAnd we see that in Tobi. Tobi is goal-driven but he has time to mess around. Even when things don't go his way he has the confidence that things will end up fine. He regards the world as his plaything and takes great joy in tinkering around with it. There is also Madara's patented arrogance as we see with his war declaration.\n\n\nAlso I think you're underestimating the tag team of Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. I'm not saying they win but it's a tough fight because Naruto has Sage Mode and Kakashi would figure out how Kamui worked during the fight.",

                    "body": "Yeah you\u2019re right about the chronology, but even then Obito could\u2019ve captured Naruto at the hotel and then went with Kisame to capture Bee and the war literally would\u2019ve ended right there.\n\nI disagree with the whole Tobi, Obito, Madara point you were making. The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

The way I see it he is Obito the entire time, just simply slipping into character when it suits him, first time we see him he\u2019s in his goofy Tobi character, but he\u2019s still Obito and he\u2019s still pursuing his goals as Obito, the same when he\u2019s acting as Madara, it\u2019s a facade he\u2019s still being Obito and working his own agendas. Yes he\u2019s ultimately working towards Madara\u2019s plan but not really, he doesn\u2019t follow the plan laid out for him totally, and he seemed to have been plotting to fuck Madara over for quite a while. \n\nEven Madara himself when he was revived from the Edo was bewildered at why it was drawn out into a full scale war, when it really didn\u2019t need to be.\n\nObito declaring war makes absolutely no sense to me, besides the fact that war is an exciting plot point. I don\u2019t think it reflects Obito that well at all, and I certainly don\u2019t think it reflects Madara that much either. Also I think a massive part of Madara dicking around so much when he was revived was \n\na) Madara loves to fight, he excels at it, he was born and raised on the battlefield, it\u2019s all he\u2019s really known. Prior to his death he was forced to remain in hiding for decades, he couldn\u2019t go out and fight or take part in the wars going on, he was stuck as a spectator. Then after decades of being a hermit and feeling his body decay and wither away, suddenly he\u2019s resurrected in the midst of the biggest war in history arguably, why wouldn\u2019t he enjoy it a little?\n\nb) The war was already in progress, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent the war because he was dead, and he can\u2019t do anything to stop the war besides win it, and considering he\u2019s effortlessly shitting on the Gokage, he must\u2019ve been feeling incredibly confident.\n\nI just don\u2019t think Madara would\u2019ve started the war the way Obito did when it just wasn\u2019t necessary, not only was it unnecessary, it was just an awful idea that made their plan almost unobtainable.\n\nAlso I\u2019m unconvinced that trio could put up much hassle against Obito. Yamato for starters is not that impressive, at least when talking about the likes of Obito or Kakashi. The only real asset they have here is Kakashi\u2019s link to the kamui dimension, but the thing is \n\n1) He wouldn\u2019t work out the trick behind Obito\u2019s phasing as fast as he did in the war, because in the war he\u2019d seen it in action more times than during the kage summit.\n\n2) Even after Kakashi worked out their eyes were linked, they STRUGGLE to land an attack on him, and that\u2019s being backed up by Guy, Bee, and 9tails Naruto\n\nAs for Naruto\u2019s sage mode, it\u2019s really not going to be any help at his level of capabilities during this period in time. First Naruto (or a clone) has to sit and gather nature chakra for minutes, Obito is probably the worst opponent to go against for this because Naruto\u2019s only real hope of entering sage mode here is if Kakashi and Yamato are able to stop Obito from moving Naruto and disrupting the process. However Obito can literally just walk up to Naruto in this time, Yamato and Kakashi can\u2019t even touch Obito so they can\u2019t physically prevent him from walking over to Naruto, their only chance would be to land an attack the instant Obito solidifies to disrupt Naruto, but that attack would have to be almost instantaneous, would need pinpoint accuracy, and would also need to not interfere with Naruto\u2019s nature chakra gathering also. I don\u2019t think Yamato or Kakashi have any way of doing this.\n\nThen let\u2019s say somehow they manage to actually achieve Naruto\u2019s sage mode, at this point in time the time limit on sage mode is 2 minutes, whether he uses all his sage chakra or not, the form lasts 2 minutes. Obito can remain intangible for 5 minutes, anytime Naruto entered sage mode, obito would just need to wait it out.",

That was just 5 bijuus\n\n2. Obito can use 7 bijuus as stated by Kakashi that he was perfectly controlling 7 bijuus\n\n3. Obito was going easy on Naruto, he didn't except him to exceed his expectations.\n\n4. Naruto\u2019s kurama avatar has a time limit as stated the kurama himself. The bijuus obito uses do not.\n\n5. Kurama can run out of chakra while the Bijuu cannot bc they are chakra itself.\n\n6. Kakashi started to die by spamming kamui in the war.\n\n7. Guyki also reached his limit bc he was also a jinchuriki unlike wild bijuus obito was controlling.\n\n8. The 5 kahe are garbage. Orange Mask obito can solo them.\n\n>Realistically wtf would they even do about Guy turning 8 gates lol? He could just enter the 8th gate and kill the 7 tailed beasts, and then what does Obito have? 1 MS, a rinnegan and 100K weak ass zetsu clones? \n\nGuy uses 8 gates and kills all 7 bijuus.\n\nObito then realizes he has to need for the Rinnegan since the bijuus are gone.\n\nObito then takes his eye back from kakashi just like madara.\n\nThen it really is game over.\n\nDMS Obito GG\n\n\n>Without the Edo Obito had absolutely zero hopes of winning the war.\n\nHe still would've won.",

It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back",

In this scenario there\u2019s no edo so at this point the entire war is fighting obito and the tailed beasts and his zetsu \n\nI hiiiiighly doubt that Sasuke joins the fight on the opposing team and doesn\u2019t go up against Naruto, his teammate, his closest bond in life and his bitter rival. Even if he\u2019s not going toe to toe directly with Naruto it\u2019s highly unlikely Naruto won\u2019t see his eyes once. There\u2019s also no scenario in which Sasuke joins the fight for obito and Naruto doesn\u2019t force Sasuke to be his opponent so he can fight him and try to talk no Jutsu him.\n\nYeah 5 bijus, with one of the two that\u2019s missing being the 1 tails (weakest tailed beast presumably) \n\n1) So the additional tailed beast is going to be enough to overpower Kurama? What if Kurama is joined by Gyuki? Unlikely..\n\n2) covered in my point 1\n\n3) Obito going easy on Naruto is a weak argument\n\n4) Naruto\u2019s avatar state has a time limit but that doesn\u2019t mean he can only fight tailed beasts in the avatar state, he can still combat them in just his Kurama chakra mode \n\n5)  The biju do not have limitless chakra btw even in their natural state\n\n6) Kakashi would\u2019ve spammed all his Jutsu far less if he hadn\u2019t spent the past 2 days fighting Edo opponents like the 7 swordsmen of the mist \n\n8) again wild bijuus do not have limitless chakra, 3rd Raikage was able to battle Gyuki to exhaustion\n\n8) The five kage definitely are not garbage, I agree orange mask Obito could solo them, if not aided by Kakashi, Guy, Naruto etc. and they\u2019re at least nearing tailed beast levels so that\u2019s like having an additional couple of tailed beasts on the alliance side \n\nYou\u2019re acting like base Obito is as capable of removing Kakashis eye as easily as 10 tails Madara removes a much more fatigued Kakashis eye. It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back",

Even at VOTE\n\n\n\n>In this scenario there\u2019s no edo so at this point the entire war is fighting obito and the tailed beasts and his zetsu \n\nObviously \n\n>I hiiiiighly doubt that Sasuke joins the fight on the opposing team and doesn\u2019t go up against Naruto, his teammate, his closest bond in life and his bitter rival. Even if he\u2019s not going toe to toe directly with Naruto it\u2019s highly unlikely Naruto won\u2019t see his eyes once. There\u2019s also no scenario in which Sasuke joins the fight for obito and Naruto doesn\u2019t force Sasuke to be his opponent so he can fight him and try to talk no Jutsu him.\n\nIt's okay, Sasuke can obito to fight against Naruto.\n\nSo the crow would come out of naruto and put Sasuke in a genjutsu.\n\nObiot would immediately recognize the crow and steal shisui's eye.\n\nNow obito has Kotoamatsukami GG\n\n\n>Yeah 5 bijus, with one of the two that\u2019s missing being the 1 tails (weakest tailed beast presumably) \n\nHeadcanon.\n\nAll bijjus have shown the same destructive capacity.\n\nAlso, you're underestimating shukaku.\n\nHe has Magnet sealing jutsu also.\n\n\n>1) So the additional tailed beast is going to be enough to overpower Kurama? What if Kurama is joined by Gyuki? Unlikely..\n\nKurama had a time limit and so does guyki. \n\nThey can't continuously fire biju bombs bc they are jinchurikis.\n\n\n>2) covered in my point 1\n\nCovered what?\n\nI stated that obito can use all seven bijus and stated by kakashi.\n\n3) Obito going easy on Naruto is a weak argument\n\nIt's a [Fact](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0571-011.png)\n\nIf obito goes out from the beginning, they have no chance.\n\nHe instantly Summons 7 bijuus and makes them spam bijuu bombs.\n\n>4) Naruto\u2019s avatar state has a time limit but that doesn\u2019t mean he can only fight tailed beasts in the avatar state, he can still combat them in just his Kurama chakra mode \n\nAre you serious?\n\nKcm mode against giant bijuus?\n\nObito by himself was bullying kcm naruto with a gunbai in a 4v1 lmao\n\n[Here](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0595-016.png)\n\n\n>5)  The biju do not have limitless chakra btw even in their natural state\n\nThe Bijuus are chakra itself. They have endless chakra otherwise they would just disappear into the wind after \"running out of chakra\"\n\n>6) Kakashi would\u2019ve spammed all his Jutsu far less if he hadn\u2019t spent the past 2 days fighting Edo opponents like the 7 swordsmen of the mist \n\nAnd obito would've shown up with all 7 bijuus fully transformed ready to spam biju bombs or super biju bombs.\n\nRemember, obito can teleport too with kamui.\n\nSo he can just go to different battle fields and blow them up like [this](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0572-002.png)\n\n\n>8) again wild bijuus do not have limitless chakra, \n\nYes they do bc they are chakra itself\n\n\n>3rd Raikage was able to battle Gyuki to exhaustion\n\nLmao\n\n3rd raikage physically fought gyuki to a standstill.\n\nStamina \u2260 chakra\n\nAre you telling me anyone besides 8th gate guy can wrestle 7 bijuus?\n\n8) The five kage definitely are not garbage, \n\nThey are against obito.\n\n>I agree orange mask Obito could solo them, if not aided by Kakashi, Guy, Naruto etc. and they\u2019re at least nearing tailed beast levels so that\u2019s like having an additional couple of tailed beasts on the alliance side.\n\n\nCouple of tailed beasts?\n\nDo you know the destructive powers of a tailed beast?\n\n5 kage don't have the fire power to match them\n\n\n>You\u2019re acting like base Obito is as capable of removing Kakashis eye as easily as 10 tails Madara removes a much more fatigued Kakashis eye. \n\nYes he can, kakashi wouldn't know or see it coming.\nHe can teleport with kamui too or use izanagi since eyes can be used like USB.\n\n\n>It\u2019s a ridiculous statement, the moment Obito solidifies to take the eye he opens himself up to attacks from anyone, \n\nLmaooo\n\nHe was 4v1 against them and they could never touch him from the real world.\n\nHe won't be trying to wrap them since he is going all out here.\n\nHe will use the black rods supplemented with kamui intangibility to immobilize them.\n\n>including Naruto who can move at near FTG speeds, \n\nOMG lmfaooo\n\nHow do you move at \"near FTG speed?\"\n\nFTG is instantaneous. There is no speed.\n\nAre you telling me Naruto can move \"near\" instantaneous speed?\n\n\n>Obito wouldn\u2019t be able to just walk up to Kakashi and take his eye back\n\nYes he will when he knows he needs.\n\nWhy don't you make a counter to him after he takes his eye back?",

That was just 5 bijuus\n\n2. Obito can use 7 bijuus as stated by Kakashi that he was perfectly controlling 7 bijuus\n\n3. Obito was going easy on Naruto, he didn't except him to exceed his expectations.\n\n4. Naruto\u2019s kurama avatar has a time limit as stated the kurama himself. The bijuus obito uses do not.\n\n5. Kurama can run out of chakra while the Bijuu cannot bc they are chakra itself.\n\n6. Kakashi started to die by spamming kamui in the war.\n\n7. Guyki also reached his limit bc he was also a jinchuriki unlike wild bijuus obito was controlling.\n\n8. The 5 kahe are garbage. Orange Mask obito can solo them.\n\n>Realistically wtf would they even do about Guy turning 8 gates lol? He could just enter the 8th gate and kill the 7 tailed beasts, and then what does Obito have? 1 MS, a rinnegan and 100K weak ass zetsu clones? \n\nGuy uses 8 gates and kills all 7 bijuus.\n\nObito then realizes he has to need for the Rinnegan since the bijuus are gone.\n\nObito then takes his eye back from kakashi just like madara.\n\nThen it really is game over.\n\nDMS Obito GG\n\n\n>Without the Edo Obito had absolutely zero hopes of winning the war.\n\nHe still would've won.",
