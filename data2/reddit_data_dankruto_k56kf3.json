Naruto had such a great way to build up and hype characters *way* before they ever even made it into the show. But it goes to show how fucking piss level the modern shinobi is compared to how astronomically stronger the old generations were.\n\nOf course sometimes I guess it fucks up, like when they just drop Hashirama and Tobirama vs the 3rd Kage as an old man, and he's more worried about Minato than them.\n\nThere's also the other scene later on during the war where Hashirama and Madara finally have their fight and just go straight up giant ninja mecha against each other, and the entire shinobi alliance just shits their pants witnessing them fight.",

But it goes to show how fucking piss level the modern shinobi is compared to how astronomically stronger the old generations were.\n\nOf course sometimes I guess it fucks up, like when they just drop Hashirama and Tobirama vs the 3rd Kage as an old man, and he's more worried about Minato than them.\n\nThere's also the other scene later on during the war where Hashirama and Madara finally have their fight and just go straight up giant ninja mecha against each other, and the entire shinobi alliance just shits their pants witnessing them fight.",

Naruto had such a great way to build up and hype characters *way* before they ever even made it into the show. But it goes to show how fucking piss level the modern shinobi is compared to how astronomically stronger the old generations were.\n\nOf course sometimes I guess it fucks up, like when they just drop Hashirama and Tobirama vs the 3rd Kage as an old man, and he's more worried about Minato than them.\n\nThere's also the other scene later on during the war where Hashirama and Madara finally have their fight and just go straight up giant ninja mecha against each other, and the entire shinobi alliance just shits their pants witnessing them fight.",

Clearly missing him because Hashi was prob depressed for a bit. They talk about their family life. \n\nThere\u2019s dialogue that says \u201cafter that we kept on meeting, always without revealing our surnames. We showed each other our shinobi techniques, we talked about the future.\u201d\n\nAlso, it goes on, after showing them sparring. \u201cThe more we met the closer we became\u201d\n\nMadara awakened the sharingan after their initial departure as kids, so we know the bond was real. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s much closer to months then the \u201cfew days skipping rocks\u201d you mentioned",
