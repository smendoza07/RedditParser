I am explaining factually the literal translation of PD's question from Korean. \n\nLike I said in my original comment, the PD  said in Korean  \"Name the works / projects that Actor LKS appeared in\". \n\nThe English subs were inaccurate. Neither the words 'Series' nor \"Movies'' was mentioned in the original question at all. In Korea, job title is used before a name gives context. The words  \"Actor LKS\" give context that the question is about acting projects. \n\nYou were very bent on the word \"series\" so I thought I'd do a favor to clarify.",
