It took exactly 7 weeks to find \"the one\" but I couldn't be happier.  We had a two platonic dates and now have had 3 intimate dates - I have to say the allowance isn't the only benefit that I'm enjoying!  Just wanted to share so others (especially woman of color) know that there are amazing SDs out there...you just have to be patient and perhaps lucky enough to find them !  Happy hunting...",

Sorry out of shape unattractive dude, if you want female sexual attention out there YOU are going to be the one to pay for it. Men are the ones with higher sex drives and it's a pipe dream to think you're going to get a new flush income  just by jacking off- something you do multiple times a day anyways. If you're wanting to experiment with your gay side, since men are the majority of people paying for sexual contact and attention, I can kind of understand that, but you're also making it harder for legit sex workers to make a living. If you even get any attention. Just logging onto a cam site is not going to get you swarms of viewers with no effort.\n\n It is not hard to gain access to an erection!",

I don't want sex unless the relationship progresses to a romantic, nor do I seek any sexual communication like talking dirty or even unmild flirting.\n\n\nHonestly I don't have sex with anyone except for giving or receiving oral because I want to lose it to someone I genuinely love and find affection with. I enjoy pleasing people however, and making sure someone is happy and feels appreciated in turn makes me happy. Honestly I'd probably do a sugar relationship without actually getting any sugar just to bring some positive vibes to someone else's life, as it makes me feel like I had on impact and fulfills me, but money would be a plus because college is expensive *cries inside*.\n\n\nWhat do you mean by they are extinct? Women might be able to get sexual gratification easily, but not all women get emotional or romantic gratification with that level of ease. If a guy isn't looking for sex and just wants to (hopefully) make someone's day better, it doesn't make sense for them to pay right?\n\n\nHonestly I don't even know, I'm new to this stuff, but the oldest person I talked to romantically with the intent for an actual relationship and not sugar relationship was 26 when I just turned 18, unfortunately her therapist said I'm too young to talk to \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d but I understand. Are there really no straight/bi/pan women looking for a friendship or intimacy without sex? Although strings attached usually refers to responsibilities and expectations (sex), for me, sex is pretty much the only string attached. I don't want it. Is that weird? I know for a fact not all guys are interested in sex and some care more about emotional gratification, similar to demisexuality.\n\n\nNo hope for a cub huh. Sad.",

Sorry out of shape unattractive dude, if you want female sexual attention out there YOU are going to be the one to pay for it. Men are the ones with higher sex drives and it's a pipe dream to think you're going to get a new flush income  just by jacking off- something you do multiple times a day anyways. If you're wanting to experiment with your gay side, since men are the majority of people paying for sexual contact and attention, I can kind of understand that, but you're also making it harder for legit sex workers to make a living. If you even get any attention. Just logging onto a cam site is not going to get you swarms of viewers with no effort.\n\n It is not hard to gain access to an erection!",

I don't want sex unless the relationship progresses to a romantic, nor do I seek any sexual communication like talking dirty or even unmild flirting.\n\n\nHonestly I don't have sex with anyone except for giving or receiving oral because I want to lose it to someone I genuinely love and find affection with. I enjoy pleasing people however, and making sure someone is happy and feels appreciated in turn makes me happy. Honestly I'd probably do a sugar relationship without actually getting any sugar just to bring some positive vibes to someone else's life, as it makes me feel like I had on impact and fulfills me, but money would be a plus because college is expensive *cries inside*.\n\n\nWhat do you mean by they are extinct? Women might be able to get sexual gratification easily, but not all women get emotional or romantic gratification with that level of ease. If a guy isn't looking for sex and just wants to (hopefully) make someone's day better, it doesn't make sense for them to pay right?\n\n\nHonestly I don't even know, I'm new to this stuff, but the oldest person I talked to romantically with the intent for an actual relationship and not sugar relationship was 26 when I just turned 18, unfortunately her therapist said I'm too young to talk to \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d but I understand. Are there really no straight/bi/pan women looking for a friendship or intimacy without sex? Although strings attached usually refers to responsibilities and expectations (sex), for me, sex is pretty much the only string attached. I don't want it. Is that weird? I know for a fact not all guys are interested in sex and some care more about emotional gratification, similar to demisexuality.\n\n\nNo hope for a cub huh. Sad.",
