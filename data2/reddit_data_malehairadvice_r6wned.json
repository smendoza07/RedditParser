            "body": "24 years old, have experienced a shedding/rapid thinning period beginning every September and ending around January for about the last 4 or 5 years. I began to suspect that it wasn't entirely due to male pattern baldness (as I thought it had been) when I realized that I was noticing the thinning at the same time every year and that my hair always managed to have decent density in the summer months despite what seemed like catastrophic balding in the fall. I read that vitamin D deficiency was associated with hair loss and put two and two together between the seasonal pattern and the fact that I live in one of the northernmost states. I started taking vitamin D (5000 iu daily), magnesium, zinc, and vitamin b12 every day a little more than one month ago. Today, I was looking at pictures from earlier this fall and realized that my hair looked a lot thinner then. I took some pictures for comparison in identical lighting and position and it seems to show that significant progress has been made since beginning supplementation.\n\nIf you are experiencing hair loss, even if you know that it's androgenic, it is probably a good idea to get your vitamin levels checked and supplement those that most people are deficient in like vitamin D and magnesium. Even if your hair loss isn't due to a vitamin deficiency, or you aren't experiencing hair loss, a vitamin deficiency may be harming your hair's health.",

Vit D poisoning usually happens after ingesting high levels of Vit D consistently for long periods of time (could be many months to years). There\u2019s no objective line that applies to every person cause vit D absorption/synthesis depends on so much, specifically, the individual\u2019s body and metabolism. So toxicity levels are measured by serum concentration in the blood and to get an objective idea of whether you\u2019re taking too much or too little vit D, you\u2019d have to do blood tests for it every month or so. So 5000 IU is not that much. Also, it takes a long time for our skin to synthesize vit D due to UV rays. Like you\u2019d have to stand outside in the sun for hours to get enough of it to store some for the winter too. As a result, a lot of us are more deficient than we think. \n\n\u201c Acute toxicity would be caused by doses of vitamin D probably in excess of 10,000 IU/day, which result in serum 25(OH)D concentrations >150 ng/ml (>375 nmol/l). That level is clearly more than the IOM-recommended UL of 4,000 IU/day. Potential chronic toxicity would result from administration of doses above 4,000 IU/day for extended periods, possibly for years, that cause serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the 50\u2013150 ng/ml (125\u2013375 nmol/l) range\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6158375/",

First of all you have a lot of healthy hair and from the pictures don't seem to be thinning a lot. Second, even if those suppliments marginally helped, it won't be possible to see after only one month of growth. If you are happy and see a difference yourself, good for you of course!\n\nFrom what I know supplements don't do anything noticable for hair growth, except if you where seriously deficient to begin with. There are only two things that are proven to work for hair growth, and I don't recommend them if you are not really balding or thinning, it's Minoxidil and Finasteride, and even with one of those, real change is only noticable after 4 to 6 months.",

To me it just looks like the difference between unwashed and washed hair. \n\nRegardless, not trying to burst OP\u2019s balloon, the second pic definitely does look better and he\u2019s got a good head of hair! Just want to chime in for those reading to manage expectations of supplements realistically. With that said, taking your standard vitamins is typically a good habit to get into in a general sense.",

One is that I started noticing tiny hairs popping up around my hairline probably 3 weeks ago or so - I was afraid that these were miniaturizing hairs but they've since increased in density. The ones from 3 weeks ago have probably grown enough by now that if they were new hairs they would make a noticeable difference in density at this point. Second reason is that my hair care routine hasn't changed at all otherwise. I've done \"nopoo\" with just conditioner washes for the last 5 or 6 months, so my hair hasn't been shampooed in any picture. Third, I have a freckle on my hairline that kind of measures any changes to my hairline (visible in pics 2 and 4). It used to be visible and separate from the hairline in every picture I would take, now it blends in with the hairline quite a bit.",

Magnesium is used to activate D3 and K2 makes sure that the calcium doesn't run freely in the body and is sent to the bones and teeth. Moreover, since D3 increases calcium absorption and calcium is an antagonist of magnesium, magnesium plays a central role and is the first one susceptible to get depleted. Certain roles are similar for both K2 and magnesium, like for instance K2 can compensate for a magnesium deficiency to some extent.\n\nIf you are interested to learn more about how D3, K2 and magnesium work together, I would suggest you this book: Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox - Dr. Kate Rheaume.",

Vit D poisoning usually happens after ingesting high levels of Vit D consistently for long periods of time (could be many months to years). There\u2019s no objective line that applies to every person cause vit D absorption/synthesis depends on so much, specifically, the individual\u2019s body and metabolism. So toxicity levels are measured by serum concentration in the blood and to get an objective idea of whether you\u2019re taking too much or too little vit D, you\u2019d have to do blood tests for it every month or so. So 5000 IU is not that much. Also, it takes a long time for our skin to synthesize vit D due to UV rays. Like you\u2019d have to stand outside in the sun for hours to get enough of it to store some for the winter too. As a result, a lot of us are more deficient than we think. \n\n\u201c Acute toxicity would be caused by doses of vitamin D probably in excess of 10,000 IU/day, which result in serum 25(OH)D concentrations >150 ng/ml (>375 nmol/l). That level is clearly more than the IOM-recommended UL of 4,000 IU/day. Potential chronic toxicity would result from administration of doses above 4,000 IU/day for extended periods, possibly for years, that cause serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the 50\u2013150 ng/ml (125\u2013375 nmol/l) range\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6158375/",

One is that I started noticing tiny hairs popping up around my hairline probably 3 weeks ago or so - I was afraid that these were miniaturizing hairs but they've since increased in density. The ones from 3 weeks ago have probably grown enough by now that if they were new hairs they would make a noticeable difference in density at this point. Second reason is that my hair care routine hasn't changed at all otherwise. I've done \"nopoo\" with just conditioner washes for the last 5 or 6 months, so my hair hasn't been shampooed in any picture. Third, I have a freckle on my hairline that kind of measures any changes to my hairline (visible in pics 2 and 4). It used to be visible and separate from the hairline in every picture I would take, now it blends in with the hairline quite a bit.",

Tired of it. Im on Dutasturide 0.5mg and Biotin 10,000IU daily for about 2 months now with no side effects. Hair feels slightly thicker due to the Biotin but it\u2019s hard to tell.  I\u2019m down to try this. Add these to the regimen but don\u2019t want to take too much or too little. Thanks",

Magnesium is used to activate D3 and K2 makes sure that the calcium doesn't run freely in the body and is sent to the bones and teeth. Moreover, since D3 increases calcium absorption and calcium is an antagonist of magnesium, magnesium plays a central role and is the first one susceptible to get depleted. Certain roles are similar for both K2 and magnesium, like for instance K2 can compensate for a magnesium deficiency to some extent.\n\nIf you are interested to learn more about how D3, K2 and magnesium work together, I would suggest you this book: Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox - Dr. Kate Rheaume.",

Vit D poisoning usually happens after ingesting high levels of Vit D consistently for long periods of time (could be many months to years). There\u2019s no objective line that applies to every person cause vit D absorption/synthesis depends on so much, specifically, the individual\u2019s body and metabolism. So toxicity levels are measured by serum concentration in the blood and to get an objective idea of whether you\u2019re taking too much or too little vit D, you\u2019d have to do blood tests for it every month or so. So 5000 IU is not that much. Also, it takes a long time for our skin to synthesize vit D due to UV rays. Like you\u2019d have to stand outside in the sun for hours to get enough of it to store some for the winter too. As a result, a lot of us are more deficient than we think. \n\n\u201c Acute toxicity would be caused by doses of vitamin D probably in excess of 10,000 IU/day, which result in serum 25(OH)D concentrations >150 ng/ml (>375 nmol/l). That level is clearly more than the IOM-recommended UL of 4,000 IU/day. Potential chronic toxicity would result from administration of doses above 4,000 IU/day for extended periods, possibly for years, that cause serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the 50\u2013150 ng/ml (125\u2013375 nmol/l) range\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6158375/",

Magnesium is used to activate D3 and K2 makes sure that the calcium doesn't run freely in the body and is sent to the bones and teeth. Moreover, since D3 increases calcium absorption and calcium is an antagonist of magnesium, magnesium plays a central role and is the first one susceptible to get depleted. Certain roles are similar for both K2 and magnesium, like for instance K2 can compensate for a magnesium deficiency to some extent.\n\nIf you are interested to learn more about how D3, K2 and magnesium work together, I would suggest you this book: Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox - Dr. Kate Rheaume.",
