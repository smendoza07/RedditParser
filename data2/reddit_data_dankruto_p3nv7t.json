Sure, Naruto and the others survived, but that\u2019s because they are exceptional students. Besides tree walking he only really trained sasuke, but he and the others all learned way more from the sannin. If it wasn\u2019t for how talented his team was and how much help they got from others it wouldn\u2019t have turned out nearly as good, like a few kids are now dead less good. Considering the fact that the bell test is about ideals and not necessarily about skill could mean that he could have the weakest genin from the academy and get them all killed because they\u2019re just way behind.",

He could\u2019ve told Naruto about the memory sharing of the shadow clones way earlier, he could\u2019ve at least tried to make Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was. My point stands, he could\u2019ve done so much more.\n\nSaying that his squad learned more because of their encounters with dangerous opponents isn\u2019t  an argument against my point. They came out stronger because they became more experienced and because they observed their opponents, that says absolutely nothing about Kakashi\u2019s abilities as a mentor. He deserves credit for keeping them alive, but he himself doesn\u2019t contribute much to their growth beyond a few moral lessons.",

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

He himself was a prodigy and it seems like he'd give up too quick on people who don't learn quick/aren't naturally strong. So in that sense you would be right. I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

The pacing is pretty fast after they graduate the academy. They meet kakashi, pass his test, go on some boring missions and then it's off to fight zabuza.  After land of waves they have somewhat of a break and then the chunin exams start. Theoretically speaking, this is where kakashi could have no longer been their teacher. I don't think Kishi gave enough room to even suggest they had training off screen with how fast things transition. After chunin exams naruto goes with jiraiya and then when he gets back sasuke dips.",

Even Sasuke shows up on time and his parents were killed by his brother like 3 years prior.\n\nI guess you're thinking of it more in an anime sense and I'm thinking of it more in a real life sense so that's why this isnt going anywhere.

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world.

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different. Seems like you have come to term with your losses, kakashi never has >!(up until maybe after talking to obito and becoming hokage as he was asked)!<\n\nSo what if kakashi grieves his whole life. I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him.

However since it isn't canon we know naruto left shortly after sasuke and we know definitively that there WAS no space for extra missions or training given how quickly the series of events go by. Chunin exams happen, short time later they get tsunade, afterwards itachi shows up and then sasuke leaves. There isnt any space there for them to have done anything which is Kishis fault. There should have been more screen time with them as a team before the Zabuza Arc imo because they went from newly formed team to S rank level mission to the exams.",

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student.

It's just that back then, with Naruto's attention span, the most he could've helped was sasuke, especially since they shared sharingans and sasuke was cursed. This was around the exam time. And once jiraiya appeared, they never realised had \"time\" to teach. It was always \"asap\", which is why you can see every teacher hurrying Naruto to learn something or the other.",

I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him.

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student.

It's just that back then, with Naruto's attention span, the most he could've helped was sasuke, especially since they shared sharingans and sasuke was cursed. This was around the exam time. And once jiraiya appeared, they never realised had \"time\" to teach. It was always \"asap\", which is why you can see every teacher hurrying Naruto to learn something or the other.",

I don't see how his grief isn't an excuse.\n\nI'm not saying that his grief doesn't suck for him. But there's just so many things he could do to just not keep people waiting, like getting his affairs in order earlier or just scheduling the training at later times. Even Sasuke shows up on time and his parents were killed by his brother like 3 years prior.\n\nI guess you're thinking of it more in an anime sense and I'm thinking of it more in a real life sense so that's why this isnt going anywhere. If I had teacher or something that constantly showed up an hour late because his childhood friend passed away 20 years ago they better be a damn good teacher which luckily in Kakashi's case he was.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world.

I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him.

Sure, Naruto and the others survived, but that\u2019s because they are exceptional students. Besides tree walking he only really trained sasuke, but he and the others all learned way more from the sannin. If it wasn\u2019t for how talented his team was and how much help they got from others it wouldn\u2019t have turned out nearly as good, like a few kids are now dead less good. Considering the fact that the bell test is about ideals and not necessarily about skill could mean that he could have the weakest genin from the academy and get them all killed because they\u2019re just way behind.",

He could\u2019ve told Naruto about the memory sharing of the shadow clones way earlier, he could\u2019ve at least tried to make Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was. My point stands, he could\u2019ve done so much more.\n\nSaying that his squad learned more because of their encounters with dangerous opponents isn\u2019t  an argument against my point. They came out stronger because they became more experienced and because they observed their opponents, that says absolutely nothing about Kakashi\u2019s abilities as a mentor.

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department.

I don't think Kishi gave enough room to even suggest they had training off screen with how fast things transition.

Even Sasuke shows up on time and his parents were killed by his brother like 3 years prior.\n\nI guess you're thinking of it more in an anime sense and I'm thinking of it more in a real life sense so that's why this isnt going anywhere.

I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him.

My point stands, he could\u2019ve done so much more.\n\nSaying that his squad learned more because of their encounters with dangerous opponents isn\u2019t  an argument against my point. They came out stronger because they became more experienced and because they observed their opponents, that says absolutely nothing about Kakashi\u2019s abilities as a mentor.

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

Kurenai tried to help Hinata be more confident, Asuma tried to motivate Shikamaru. And while I will concede on the point that Kakashi does a decent job at instilling proper teamwork, I do think that\u2019s the only thing he did right. He did the bare minimum and if he had any other team it wouldn\u2019t have worked out nearly as well because it\u2019s just dumb luck that he has a naturally strong team that somehow manages to escape these encounters alive.",

He himself was a prodigy and it seems like he'd give up too quick on people who don't learn quick/aren't naturally strong. So in that sense you would be right. I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

The pacing is pretty fast after they graduate the academy. They meet kakashi, pass his test, go on some boring missions and then it's off to fight zabuza.  After land of waves they have somewhat of a break and then the chunin exams start. Theoretically speaking, this is where kakashi could have no longer been their teacher. I don't think Kishi gave enough room to even suggest they had training off screen with how fast things transition.

Even Sasuke shows up on time and his parents were killed by his brother like 3 years prior.\n\nI guess you're thinking of it more in an anime sense and I'm thinking of it more in a real life sense so that's why this isnt going anywhere.

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different. Seems like you have come to term with your losses, kakashi never has >!(up until maybe after talking to obito and becoming hokage as he was asked)!<\n\nSo what if kakashi grieves his whole life. I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him. While never stated I assumed he would have stopped by is coronation as 6th.",

He could\u2019ve told Naruto about the memory sharing of the shadow clones way earlier, he could\u2019ve at least tried to make Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was. My point stands, he could\u2019ve done so much more.\n\nSaying that his squad learned more because of their encounters with dangerous opponents isn\u2019t  an argument against my point. They came out stronger because they became more experienced and because they observed their opponents, that says absolutely nothing about Kakashi\u2019s abilities as a mentor.

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student.

The pacing is pretty fast after they graduate the academy. They meet kakashi, pass his test, go on some boring missions and then it's off to fight zabuza.  After land of waves they have somewhat of a break and then the chunin exams start. Theoretically speaking, this is where kakashi could have no longer been their teacher. I don't think Kishi gave enough room to even suggest they had training off screen with how fast things transition. After chunin exams naruto goes with jiraiya and then when he gets back sasuke dips.",

It's just that back then, with Naruto's attention span, the most he could've helped was sasuke, especially since they shared sharingans and sasuke was cursed. This was around the exam time. And once jiraiya appeared, they never realised had \"time\" to teach. It was always \"asap\", which is why you can see every teacher hurrying Naruto to learn something or the other.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world. Thinking about the ratio of the effort of his being on time to the anger of the people he keeps waiting just seems too big for him to not show up on time.",

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different. Seems like you have come to term with your losses, kakashi never has >!(up until maybe after talking to obito and becoming hokage as he was asked)!<\n\nSo what if kakashi grieves his whole life. I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him. While never stated I assumed he would have stopped by is coronation as 6th.",

He could\u2019ve told Naruto about the memory sharing of the shadow clones way earlier, he could\u2019ve at least tried to make Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was. My point stands, he could\u2019ve done so much more.\n\nSaying that his squad learned more because of their encounters with dangerous opponents isn\u2019t  an argument against my point. They came out stronger because they became more experienced and because they observed their opponents, that says absolutely nothing about Kakashi\u2019s abilities as a mentor. He deserves credit for keeping them alive, but he himself doesn\u2019t contribute much to their growth beyond a few moral lessons.",

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

And while I will concede on the point that Kakashi does a decent job at instilling proper teamwork, I do think that\u2019s the only thing he did right. He did the bare minimum and if he had any other team it wouldn\u2019t have worked out nearly as well because it\u2019s just dumb luck that he has a naturally strong team that somehow manages to escape these encounters alive.",

He himself was a prodigy and it seems like he'd give up too quick on people who don't learn quick/aren't naturally strong. So in that sense you would be right. I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

The pacing is pretty fast after they graduate the academy. They meet kakashi, pass his test, go on some boring missions and then it's off to fight zabuza.  After land of waves they have somewhat of a break and then the chunin exams start. Theoretically speaking, this is where kakashi could have no longer been their teacher. I don't think Kishi gave enough room to even suggest they had training off screen with how fast things transition. After chunin exams naruto goes with jiraiya and then when he gets back sasuke dips.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world.

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different. Seems like you have come to term with your losses, kakashi never has >!(up until maybe after talking to obito and becoming hokage as he was asked)!<\n\nSo what if kakashi grieves his whole life. I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him. While never stated I assumed he would have stopped by is coronation as 6th.",

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

He himself was a prodigy and it seems like he'd give up too quick on people who don't learn quick/aren't naturally strong. So in that sense you would be right. I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

It's just that back then, with Naruto's attention span, the most he could've helped was sasuke, especially since they shared sharingans and sasuke was cursed. This was around the exam time. And once jiraiya appeared, they never realised had \"time\" to teach. It was always \"asap\", which is why you can see every teacher hurrying Naruto to learn something or the other.",

I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him.

Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination.

He himself was a prodigy and it seems like he'd give up too quick on people who don't learn quick/aren't naturally strong. So in that sense you would be right. I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

It's just that back then, with Naruto's attention span, the most he could've helped was sasuke, especially since they shared sharingans and sasuke was cursed. This was around the exam time. And once jiraiya appeared, they never realised had \"time\" to teach. It was always \"asap\", which is why you can see every teacher hurrying Naruto to learn something or the other.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world. Thinking about the ratio of the effort of his being on time to the anger of the people he keeps waiting just seems too big for him to not show up on time.",

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different. Seems like you have come to term with your losses, kakashi never has >!(up until maybe after talking to obito and becoming hokage as he was asked)!<\n\nSo what if kakashi grieves his whole life. I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him. While never stated I assumed he would have stopped by is coronation as 6th.",

He could\u2019ve told Naruto about the memory sharing of the shadow clones way earlier, he could\u2019ve at least tried to make Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was. My point stands, he could\u2019ve done so much more.\n\nSaying that his squad learned more because of their encounters with dangerous opponents isn\u2019t  an argument against my point. They came out stronger because they became more experienced and because they observed their opponents, that says absolutely nothing about Kakashi\u2019s abilities as a mentor.

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

He did the bare minimum and if he had any other team it wouldn\u2019t have worked out nearly as well because it\u2019s just dumb luck that he has a naturally strong team that somehow manages to escape these encounters alive.",

He himself was a prodigy and it seems like he'd give up too quick on people who don't learn quick/aren't naturally strong. So in that sense you would be right. I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

Even Sasuke shows up on time and his parents were killed by his brother like 3 years prior.\n\nI guess you're thinking of it more in an anime sense and I'm thinking of it more in a real life sense so that's why this isnt going anywhere. If I had teacher or something that constantly showed up an hour late because his childhood friend passed away 20 years ago they better be a damn good teacher which luckily in Kakashi's case he was.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world.

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different.

I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him. While never stated I assumed he would have stopped by is coronation as 6th.",

I don't think making Sakura realize how dangerous her attitude was on him since no teacher really tried to change a students mentality/attitude/behavior (ex: Neji, Sasuke, Hinata). Kakashi taught them enough about teamwork to make a huge difference vs Zabuza. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to free Kakashi from the water prison. They both also worked together to bring down Haku and also learned how important comrades were since Sasuke put his life on the line for Naruto. Sakura was fighting tooth and nail to protect Naruto and Sasuke in the forest as well. The point of the Jonin teachers was to teach genin how to operate as a team and Kakashi in particular taught them the importance of protecting your comrades over completing the mission. The academy teaches fundamentals and genin teams teach teamwork and coordination. Poor writing on Kishis part made Sakura irrelevant but there's multiple times where Naruto and Sasuke work together.",

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department.

I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him.

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world. Thinking about the ratio of the effort of his being on time to the anger of the people he keeps waiting just seems too big for him to not show up on time.",

Maybe try to see that Kakashi's feelings on grief are different than yours. and understand that everyone grieves different. Seems like you have come to term with your losses, kakashi never has >!(up until maybe after talking to obito and becoming hokage as he was asked)!<\n\nSo what if kakashi grieves his whole life. I plan to. Moving on with your life can be done without letting  others see or feel your grief. Though kakashi purposefully imitates bad habits\n\nKakashi takes after Obito who was almost always late so the habit probably makes him feel closer to obito.\n\n As obito always stopped to help the elderly folks with their groceries or chores and kakashi hated how ge was always late complaining to a young obito about it almost everytime!\n\nSo your answer is kakashi imitates obitos tardiness in a sense to be closer to him. While never stated I assumed he would have stopped by is coronation as 6th.",

I think it was just perfect match for him to get the 2 strongest genin + while Sakura was useless she had the best Chakra control of her class and was also an excellent student. Not quite shikamaru levels of excellency but nonetheless she isn't lacking in the mental department. He didn't HAVE to teach them alot because they were so naturally talented he just needed to guide them which he did just fine.",

Just be there on time. If he couldn't make it then tell them to meet later, takes like a 15 second sentence to say.\n\nLike christ it's not like he's going to dig up a grave or meet with his dead friends parents or anything like that. It's showing up. On time. Children can do it. I take back my real life statement vs Ninja world statement. Idgaf if he's in the Ninja world. Thinking about the ratio of the effort of his being on time to the anger of the people he keeps waiting just seems too big for him to not show up on time.",
