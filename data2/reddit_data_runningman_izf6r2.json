But it\u2019s telling how good they were that even official streaming services like Dramafever used their videos, and are well-regarded by international RM fans to this day.  I credit their work with the huge international popularity that Running Man\u2019s had ever since almost the start.",

Although those other services\u2019 translations had lots of errors, it ultimately became a \u201cgame\u201d of speed, with whoever coming out first got more views.  iSubs eventually fell too far behind.  But it\u2019s telling how good they were that even official streaming services like Dramafever used their videos, and are well-regarded by international RM fans to this day.  I credit their work with the huge international popularity that Running Man\u2019s had ever since almost the start.",
