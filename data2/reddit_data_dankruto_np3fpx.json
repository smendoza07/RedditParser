He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

All he had to do is make use of shadow clones with masks or transformation jutsu so that if they're discovered they can disappear at any time without being found out.\n\nAnd don't tell me his disease prevented him from doing that. It's far less intensive than Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, or Susanoo.\n\nThis ignoring what he actually should have done, which is report him to his Father who really didn't want a coup but didn't want to fight his close relatives either and report it to Hiruzen because Obito was far more dangerous anyway. Itachi would have been able to convince his Father with that information to abandon the coup and Hiruzen to let the Uchiha move back to their original homes as well as that Danzo was dangerous since he killed Shisui and stole his eye.",

They even have a symbol which is the one on Sakuras back originally. Have you even seen the anime or read the manga? Anything? The Haruno Clan isnt talked about as much as the Uzumaki, Uchiha, or Hyuga clans, however they are known for there large chakra pools and chakra manipulation, that's why Sakura is a great medical ninja, they also say that in the anime and manga, if you actually read it. Think, there are tons of clans that rarely get brought up, the Lee Clan, the Ogata Clan, the Hatake Clan, they are all clans.",

Saying that Sakura didn't have a clan is not stupid. It's factual information. There is no \"haruno clan\" just like how there is no \"namikaze clan\". It has never been stated that any such clan exists. It's just a surname like \"Johnson\", \"Smith\" or \"Smirnoff\".",

He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

But tell me who are the Uchiha are in the real world? Who needs to be genocided for world peace.\n\nAnd had Hagoromo killed Indra when he was still weak, there would still be conflict in the world, because that's how things always go.\n\nMadara's actions 80 years ago don't give Rasa an out for tormenting his son in the worst way I can imagine - tricking him into killing the only person that cares about him so he can't blame anyone but himself and have that person tell him his mother hated him.\n\nAlso Kushina got tormented because she was a foreigner, not because she was a jinchuriki and the Hyuga tortured their family members and Madara had nothing to do with that.

All he had to do is make use of shadow clones with masks or transformation jutsu so that if they're discovered they can disappear at any time without being found out.\n\nAnd don't tell me his disease prevented him from doing that. It's far less intensive than Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, or Susanoo.\n\nThis ignoring what he actually should have done, which is report him to his Father who really didn't want a coup but didn't want to fight his close relatives either and report it to Hiruzen because Obito was far more dangerous anyway. Itachi would have been able to convince his Father with that information to abandon the coup and Hiruzen to let the Uchiha move back to their original homes as well as that Danzo was dangerous since he killed Shisui and stole his eye.",

I get what you are trying to say but at the end of the day she has another clan, which kinda means shes not a true Uchiha, since other clans get married and have children outside of there respective clans, except the Uchiha, and I think the Hyuga dont either.",

The Haruno Clan isnt talked about as much as the Uzumaki, Uchiha, or Hyuga clans, however they are known for there large chakra pools and chakra manipulation, that's why Sakura is a great medical ninja, they also say that in the anime and manga, if you actually read it.

Sakura is an Uchiha since she married into the Uchiha clan just like how Sai is a Yamanaka, Temari is a Nara, Karui is an Akimichi and Hinata is an Uzumaki as they all married into these clans. \n\nAlso, no. Saying that Sakura didn't have a clan is not stupid. It's factual information. There is no \"haruno clan\" just like how there is no \"namikaze clan\". It has never been stated that any such clan exists. It's just a surname like \"Johnson\", \"Smith\" or \"Smirnoff\".",

He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

Pre-Boruto almost nobody wore identifiable clan symbols unless they were either genin or students. I think it was expected that you put your identity as a clan was secondary to your identity as a Leaf Ninja. Things like the Will of Fire, the standardized uniform.\n\nOne weird exception would be the Akamichi clan, who wear samurai-style lamellae and headdresses instead of standard flak jackets",

Sakura is an Uchiha since she married into the Uchiha clan just like how Sai is a Yamanaka, Temari is a Nara, Karui is an Akimichi and Hinata is an Uzumaki as they all married into these clans. \n\nAlso, no. Saying that Sakura didn't have a clan is not stupid. It's factual information. There is no \"haruno clan\" just like how there is no \"namikaze clan\". It has never been stated that any such clan exists. It's just a surname like \"Johnson\", \"Smith\" or \"Smirnoff\".",

Tobirama's hypothesis about the sharingan is wrong because there is still conflict in other villages, which lead to people like Gaara and Zabuza.\n\nObito did not take pleasure in it, he was pretending to be Madara but even when he explains things to Sasuke, he's not acting happy or sad about it, just his usual stoic voice with the mask on.\n\nMadara explains in the war that people desire peace as well as conflict, he knows this because it's just how he feels. If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though. As for the rest of the Uchiha, he had plenty of time to get rid of them before he died but he didn't because to him they were the same as everyone else that caused him pain.",

Unlike Obito who outright admits he did what he wanted to do.\n\n>Tobirama's hypothesis about the sharingan is wrong because there is still conflict in other villages, which lead to people like Gaara and Zabuza.\n\nNot sure what Tobirama's hypothesis has to do with other conflicts. He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

Had he freed Kurama, there wouldn't be a power imbalance between villages.\n\nNaruto has themes that are present in the real world - there are multiple \"villains\" fighting against each other. But tell me who are the Uchiha are in the real world? Who needs to be genocided for world peace.\n\nAnd had Hagoromo killed Indra when he was still weak, there would still be conflict in the world, because that's how things always go.\n\nMadara's actions 80 years ago don't give Rasa an out for tormenting his son in the worst way I can imagine - tricking him into killing the only person that cares about him so he can't blame anyone but himself and have that person tell him his mother hated him.\n\nAlso Kushina got tormented because she was a foreigner, not because she was a jinchuriki and the Hyuga tortured their family members and Madara had nothing to do with that. You can't stop all people from being bad to each other.\n\nIn order to have keep your living weapon demigods from destroying you instead of your enemies, you really need to need to keep them sane, but everyone is hellbent on pushing them over the edge until they annihilate the village they're born in.",

I get what you are trying to say but at the end of the day she has another clan, which kinda means shes not a true Uchiha, since other clans get married and have children outside of there respective clans, except the Uchiha, and I think the Hyuga dont either.",

The Haruno Clan isnt talked about as much as the Uzumaki, Uchiha, or Hyuga clans, however they are known for there large chakra pools and chakra manipulation, that's why Sakura is a great medical ninja, they also say that in the anime and manga, if you actually read it. Think, there are tons of clans that rarely get brought up, the Lee Clan, the Ogata Clan, the Hatake Clan, they are all clans.",

Saying that Sakura didn't have a clan is not stupid. It's factual information. There is no \"haruno clan\" just like how there is no \"namikaze clan\". It has never been stated that any such clan exists. It's just a surname like \"Johnson\", \"Smith\" or \"Smirnoff\".",

He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

Had he freed Kurama, there wouldn't be a power imbalance between villages.\n\nNaruto has themes that are present in the real world - there are multiple \"villains\" fighting against each other. But tell me who are the Uchiha are in the real world? Who needs to be genocided for world peace.\n\nAnd had Hagoromo killed Indra when he was still weak, there would still be conflict in the world, because that's how things always go.\n\nMadara's actions 80 years ago don't give Rasa an out for tormenting his son in the worst way I can imagine - tricking him into killing the only person that cares about him so he can't blame anyone but himself and have that person tell him his mother hated him.\n\nAlso Kushina got tormented because she was a foreigner, not because she was a jinchuriki and the Hyuga tortured their family members and Madara had nothing to do with that. You can't stop all people from being bad to each other.\n\nIn order to have keep your living weapon demigods from destroying you instead of your enemies, you really need to need to keep them sane, but everyone is hellbent on pushing them over the edge until they annihilate the village they're born in.",

I think it was expected that you put your identity as a clan was secondary to your identity as a Leaf Ninja.

The Haruno Clan isnt talked about as much as the Uzumaki, Uchiha, or Hyuga clans, however they are known for there large chakra pools and chakra manipulation, that's why Sakura is a great medical ninja, they also say that in the anime and manga, if you actually read it. Think, there are tons of clans that rarely get brought up, the Lee Clan, the Ogata Clan, the Hatake Clan, they are all clans.",

He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

But tell me who are the Uchiha are in the real world? Who needs to be genocided for world peace.\n\nAnd had Hagoromo killed Indra when he was still weak, there would still be conflict in the world, because that's how things always go.\n\nMadara's actions 80 years ago don't give Rasa an out for tormenting his son in the worst way I can imagine - tricking him into killing the only person that cares about him so he can't blame anyone but himself and have that person tell him his mother hated him.\n\nAlso Kushina got tormented because she was a foreigner, not because she was a jinchuriki and the Hyuga tortured their family members and Madara had nothing to do with that. You can't stop all people from being bad to each other.\n\nIn order to have keep your living weapon demigods from destroying you instead of your enemies, you really need to need to keep them sane, but everyone is hellbent on pushing them over the edge until they annihilate the village they're born in.",

Lmao\n\n>pretty much any hokage except hashirama wanted to conquer other villages or at least loot other village's asset like byakugan or tailed beast.\n\nByakugan IS Konoha's asset. No Hokage needs to loot it, lmao. And no Hokage was a warmongerer. Have you even watched this series?",

He realised Uchiha are unstable and gave them important positions and influence.\n\nAnd he didn't put the Uchiha out, Danzo did and only after Kurama's attack so get your facts right!\n\n>if madara succeeded hashirama, the uchihas would have turned a lot better. Madara might be scary and ruthless in a battle but he definitely had compassion for Shinobi world and shared the vision of hashirama.\n\nYeah sure he did when he was an absolute warmongerer, attacked Mu and Onoki in the name of Konoha and threw massive tantrum because he lost an election.\n\nPlease go and watch Naruto before coming to its subs.",

Yes it is what that word means.\n\nThey weren't totally to blame for their lack of integration, Tobirama specifically did that. Having influence and having power aren't the same things.

I think they had the same base issues as every clan does by virtue of being a clan. A combination of politics outside and the Uchiha leadership's decisions exacerbated and highlighted those issues to the point that an Uchiha had to save the Leaf from the Uchiha. Which sort of contradicts the idea that they were all inherently bad.",

Uchiha weren't doing to bad in that regard until Obito shat on everything. Not all Uchiha were inherently bad but too many of them hey were full of themselves.\n\n>I don't believe in uniquely intrinsic issues\n\nIt doesn't matter what you believe in when the story has established the Uchiha as otherwise. They are after all a flamboyant fictional clan. Even 'external' issues have something to do with other Uchiha, namely Obito and Madara.\n\nYes, I can tell you haven't watched a lot of Naruto as you said so in another comment here.",

He says Sharingan functions on emotions and can potentially lead to madness. He was objectively right.\n\nWhile we're at Gaara and Zabuza, let's not forget who made them: Jinchuriki abuse started with Madara when he enslaved Kurama. Zabuza had to leave in Bloody Mist because Madara and Obito had destoryed and corrupted his country's way of life and culture. So it's the Uchiha's fault their lives sucked.\n\n>If everyone just surrendered, he wouldn't slaughter them though\n\nOh yeah, everyone should surrender to ugly ass psycho Uchiha and accept him as supreme fascist.

Had he freed Kurama, there wouldn't be a power imbalance between villages.\n\nNaruto has themes that are present in the real world - there are multiple \"villains\" fighting against each other. But tell me who are the Uchiha are in the real world? Who needs to be genocided for world peace.\n\nAnd had Hagoromo killed Indra when he was still weak, there would still be conflict in the world, because that's how things always go.\n\nMadara's actions 80 years ago don't give Rasa an out for tormenting his son in the worst way I can imagine - tricking him into killing the only person that cares about him so he can't blame anyone but himself and have that person tell him his mother hated him.\n\nAlso Kushina got tormented because she was a foreigner, not because she was a jinchuriki and the Hyuga tortured their family members and Madara had nothing to do with that. You can't stop all people from being bad to each other.\n\nIn order to have keep your living weapon demigods from destroying you instead of your enemies, you really need to need to keep them sane, but everyone is hellbent on pushing them over the edge until they annihilate the village they're born in.",

Had he freed Kurama, there wouldn't be a power imbalance between villages.\n\nNaruto has themes that are present in the real world - there are multiple \"villains\" fighting against each other. But tell me who are the Uchiha are in the real world? Who needs to be genocided for world peace.\n\nAnd had Hagoromo killed Indra when he was still weak, there would still be conflict in the world, because that's how things always go.\n\nMadara's actions 80 years ago don't give Rasa an out for tormenting his son in the worst way I can imagine - tricking him into killing the only person that cares about him so he can't blame anyone but himself and have that person tell him his mother hated him.\n\nAlso Kushina got tormented because she was a foreigner, not because she was a jinchuriki and the Hyuga tortured their family members and Madara had nothing to do with that. You can't stop all people from being bad to each other.\n\nIn order to have keep your living weapon demigods from destroying you instead of your enemies, you really need to need to keep them sane, but everyone is hellbent on pushing them over the edge until they annihilate the village they're born in.",

I think they had the same base issues as every clan does by virtue of being a clan. A combination of politics outside and the Uchiha leadership's decisions exacerbated and highlighted those issues to the point that an Uchiha had to save the Leaf from the Uchiha.

They are after all a flamboyant fictional clan.

The Hyuga never tried to get privilege or power for themselves in the village or take over even though they never had much power to begin with.\n\nAll Tobirama did was giving them the law enforcement position [which made the Uchiha the elite](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1c49ff905a3169639c8263ad7e9743fa) and should have had them integrate with the village better. Uchiha weren't doing to bad in that regard until Obito shat on everything. Not all Uchiha were inherently bad but too many of them hey were full of themselves.\n\n>I don't believe in uniquely intrinsic issues\n\nIt doesn't matter what you believe in when the story has established the Uchiha as otherwise. They are after all a flamboyant fictional clan. Even 'external' issues have something to do with other Uchiha, namely Obito and Madara.\n\nYes, I can tell you haven't watched a lot of Naruto as you said so in another comment here.",
