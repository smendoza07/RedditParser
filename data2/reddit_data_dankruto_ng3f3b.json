There's just nothing else to continue, the only way would be repeating themselves and undermining everything that came before which is exactly what Boruto has done. It's exactly the same cycle that Dragon Ball fell into the moment they set up frieza as the most powerful being in the entire UNIVERSE - At that point what do you? Pretty much the same thing over and over again except with a new guy who it turns out is the REAL most powerful super awesome enemy in the universe every single new arc.",

Dealing with more mature themes in darker manners, dropping much of the comedy and wakiness. Maybe Naruto dealing with the the death of Ninja's Way as the world grows peaceful, the same way Samurai had to redefine themselves--and many failing to do so in a proper way. \n\nMaybe dealing with father hood honestly, the work it takes to sustain a marriage in a busy life, and so on. \n\nMaybe not everyone of our Naruto heroes can have kids, or maybe not all of their kids are interested in Ninja destinies. One of Naruto kids doesn't want to do it at all--and then Hinata has a fight with Naruto about how she never wanted to follow her dad's family crap just because she was born into the wrong family--that could take a whole arc, leading to Naruto realizing his destiny is not the one meant for his kids. \n\nYou know...dealing with them growing, in new ways.",

If a story that doesn't need a sequel for some reason gets one then what it should do is be an evolution, it shouldn't be the same shit repackaged. If that means lowering the action, so be it as long as it's actually interesting. I will applaud the sheer amount of Sakuga boruto gets sometimes though.",

Out of the 199 episodes so far, maybe like 100 is filler and is very skippable, but just considering the actual story stuff it's not that bad. It's not really a continuation rather than a new story in the same setting with returning characters. The recent arcs have been pretty interesting too, but I wouldn't call it anywhere near as good as naruto yet.",

There's just nothing else to continue, the only way would be repeating themselves and undermining everything that came before which is exactly what Boruto has done. It's exactly the same cycle that Dragon Ball fell into the moment they set up frieza as the most powerful being in the entire UNIVERSE - At that point what do you?

Dealing with more mature themes in darker manners, dropping much of the comedy and wakiness. Maybe Naruto dealing with the the death of Ninja's Way as the world grows peaceful, the same way Samurai had to redefine themselves--and many failing to do so in a proper way. \n\nMaybe dealing with father hood honestly, the work it takes to sustain a marriage in a busy life, and so on. \n\nMaybe not everyone of our Naruto heroes can have kids, or maybe not all of their kids are interested in Ninja destinies. One of Naruto kids doesn't want to do it at all--and then Hinata has a fight with Naruto about how she never wanted to follow her dad's family crap just because she was born into the wrong family--that could take a whole arc, leading to Naruto realizing his destiny is not the one meant for his kids. \n\nYou know...dealing with them growing, in new ways.",

One of Naruto kids doesn't want to do it at all--and then Hinata has a fight with Naruto about how she never wanted to follow her dad's family crap just because she was born into the wrong family--that could take a whole arc, leading to Naruto realizing his destiny is not the one meant for his kids. \n\nYou know...dealing with them growing, in new ways.",

Out of the 199 episodes so far, maybe like 100 is filler and is very skippable, but just considering the actual story stuff it's not that bad. It's not really a continuation rather than a new story in the same setting with returning characters. The recent arcs have been pretty interesting too, but I wouldn't call it anywhere near as good as naruto yet.",

But you can't continue it in the same genre.\n\nShonen anime is about some charming kid that becomes amazing, but the real victory is about the friends they make along the way. And how over-powered they become along the way.\n\nBoruto shouldn't be a shonen, it's too stupid at this point. It should a Seinen. Dealing with more mature themes in darker manners, dropping much of the comedy and wakiness. Maybe Naruto dealing with the the death of Ninja's Way as the world grows peaceful, the same way Samurai had to redefine themselves--and many failing to do so in a proper way. \n\nMaybe dealing with father hood honestly, the work it takes to sustain a marriage in a busy life, and so on. \n\nMaybe not everyone of our Naruto heroes can have kids, or maybe not all of their kids are interested in Ninja destinies. One of Naruto kids doesn't want to do it at all--and then Hinata has a fight with Naruto about how she never wanted to follow her dad's family crap just because she was born into the wrong family--that could take a whole arc, leading to Naruto realizing his destiny is not the one meant for his kids. \n\nYou know...dealing with them growing, in new ways.",

One of Naruto kids doesn't want to do it at all--and then Hinata has a fight with Naruto about how she never wanted to follow her dad's family crap just because she was born into the wrong family--that could take a whole arc, leading to Naruto realizing his destiny is not the one meant for his kids. \n\nYou know...dealing with them growing, in new ways.",
