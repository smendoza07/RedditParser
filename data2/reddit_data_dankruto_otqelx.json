Everytime we see these people fight, it's using their clans powers. And even if it wasn't for their powers, they were still raised as kids to be ninja, unlike Sakura.\n\n>Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nNeji is a \"genius\". Naruto has terrible fundamentals and also has natural raw power and was taught by jiraiya, and Sasuke was trained before and is also considered a prodigy and then taught by kakashi. All his power comes from things he was taught as a kid\n\n>And all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nThat's head cannon. And either way, that doesn't even matter. It's still kakashis duty to teach her as her sensei\n\n>We have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful\n\nAnd Sakura is one of them. So why couldn't kakashi do something to teach her earlier. She clearly had potential and that potential wasn't unlocked without training from someone else.\n\n>He sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\nIdk. Walk on water, maybe genjutsu training, or literally anything else. Give her another exercise to learn and challenge her, like a good teacher should. And the fact that she aced it shows she had talent and wasn't \"hopeless\" like you implied.\n\n>He didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nHe is a *squad* leader. His job is to teach *all* his students. He's not a \"master\" like jiraiya who can focus on one kid. Naruto needed training for the neji fight, why not help him with that too?\n\n>her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.\n\nComparing her to a prodigy and a boy who's got inhuman levels of power is hardly fair. Not to mention, they never gain significant strength unless they were specifically taught something by others. Everything else is just basic improvement. Calling Naruto self taught is a bit of a stretch.\n\n>And my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with that. I also think she should've a little done more herself. Thats why I said kakashi only deserves *some* blame. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that kakashi doesn't really teach her *anything*. \n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke wouldn't have made *major* growth if it wasn't for people *teaching* them and telling them what to focus on. Sakura has all the basics down. She needed someone else to teach her how to take it to the next level. Not many characters has done that on their own, and ones that have are considered prodigies.\n\n\nAnd if anything, he should've spent *more* time with her than Naruto and Sasuke if they can teach themselves. As a teacher, he should've focused on the student who needed his help.\n\n\nMy point was simply that kakashi could've/should've done more to teach her as her sensei. You're turning this into something bigger than it is. You're acting like she \"didn't want\" to learn. She's never turned down a lesson from him.",

Everytime we see these people fight, it's using their clans powers. And even if it wasn't for their powers, they were still raised as kids to be ninja, unlike Sakura.\n\n>Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nNeji is a \"genius\". Naruto has terrible fundamentals and also has natural raw power and was taught by jiraiya, and Sasuke was trained before and is also considered a prodigy and then taught by kakashi. All his power comes from things he was taught as a kid\n\n>And all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nThat's head cannon. And either way, that doesn't even matter. It's still kakashis duty to teach her as her sensei\n\n>We have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful\n\nAnd Sakura is one of them. So why couldn't kakashi do something to teach her earlier. She clearly had potential and that potential wasn't unlocked without training from someone else.\n\n>He sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\nIdk. Walk on water, maybe genjutsu training, or literally anything else. Give her another exercise to learn and challenge her, like a good teacher should. And the fact that she aced it shows she had talent and wasn't \"hopeless\" like you implied.\n\n>He didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nHe is a *squad* leader. His job is to teach *all* his students. He's not a \"master\" like jiraiya who can focus on one kid. Naruto needed training for the neji fight, why not help him with that too?\n\n>her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.\n\nComparing her to a prodigy and a boy who's got inhuman levels of power is hardly fair. Not to mention, they never gain significant strength unless they were specifically taught something by others. Everything else is just basic improvement. Calling Naruto self taught is a bit of a stretch.\n\n>And my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with that. I also think she should've a little done more herself. Thats why I said kakashi only deserves *some* blame. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that kakashi doesn't really teach her *anything*. \n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke wouldn't have made *major* growth if it wasn't for people *teaching* them and telling them what to focus on. Sakura has all the basics down. She needed someone else to teach her how to take it to the next level. Not many characters has done that on their own, and ones that have are considered prodigies.\n\n\nAnd if anything, he should've spent *more* time with her than Naruto and Sasuke if they can teach themselves. As a teacher, he should've focused on the student who needed his help.\n\n\nMy point was simply that kakashi could've/should've done more to teach her as her sensei. You're turning this into something bigger than it is. You're acting like she \"didn't want\" to learn. She's never turned down a lesson from him.",

Same with kiba, shino, choji, Hinata, neji, etc. Their clan powers are what makes them strong. Take that stuff away and they're no better than sakura. And they were also trained by their parents who were all elite ninja. Sakura didn't have that.\n\n\nThe average shinobi in naruto doesn't have anything special. There were a 100,000 ninja in the 4th war. Most of them didn't have any special power. They had basic skill that just gets better as they get older.\n\n\n>Kakashi trains a Sakura who's only priority is her appearance for less than a year.\n\nWhen kakashi is teaching them tree climbing and she aces it right away, what does he do? He just sends her back to the house. He doesn't challenge or push her at all.\n\n\nI agree that Sakura should've done more on her own as well, but like I said, kakashi deserves some of the blame as well. They're 12. The purpose of the academy was to teach you the basics and then you get taught more by you sensei once you graduate.\n\n\nAnd even if she tried who knows if he would train her.

Everytime we see these people fight, it's using their clans powers. And even if it wasn't for their powers, they were still raised as kids to be ninja, unlike Sakura.\n\n>Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nNeji is a \"genius\". Naruto has terrible fundamentals and also has natural raw power and was taught by jiraiya, and Sasuke was trained before and is also considered a prodigy and then taught by kakashi. All his power comes from things he was taught as a kid\n\n>And all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nThat's head cannon. And either way, that doesn't even matter. It's still kakashis duty to teach her as her sensei\n\n>We have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful\n\nAnd Sakura is one of them. So why couldn't kakashi do something to teach her earlier. She clearly had potential and that potential wasn't unlocked without training from someone else.\n\n>He sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\nIdk. Walk on water, maybe genjutsu training, or literally anything else. Give her another exercise to learn and challenge her, like a good teacher should. And the fact that she aced it shows she had talent and wasn't \"hopeless\" like you implied.\n\n>He didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nHe is a *squad* leader. His job is to teach *all* his students. He's not a \"master\" like jiraiya who can focus on one kid. Naruto needed training for the neji fight, why not help him with that too?\n\n>her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.\n\nComparing her to a prodigy and a boy who's got inhuman levels of power is hardly fair. Not to mention, they never gain significant strength unless they were specifically taught something by others. Everything else is just basic improvement. Calling Naruto self taught is a bit of a stretch.\n\n>And my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with that. I also think she should've a little done more herself. Thats why I said kakashi only deserves *some* blame. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that kakashi doesn't really teach her *anything*. \n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke wouldn't have made *major* growth if it wasn't for people *teaching* them and telling them what to focus on. Sakura has all the basics down. She needed someone else to teach her how to take it to the next level. Not many characters has done that on their own, and ones that have are considered prodigies.\n\n\nAnd if anything, he should've spent *more* time with her than Naruto and Sasuke if they can teach themselves. As a teacher, he should've focused on the student who needed his help.\n\n\nMy point was simply that kakashi could've/should've done more to teach her as her sensei. You're turning this into something bigger than it is. You're acting like she \"didn't want\" to learn. She's never turned down a lesson from him.",

She also has great analytical skills and chakra control. \n\nIt's an incredibly large part of being a ninja. Analytical skill is nothing without Combat skill. Shikamaru has the combat skill to support his analytical skill hence why he's a threat.\n\nMultiple people throughout part 1 call out her lack of combat ability\n\n>Take away the yamanaka from ino and what is she? Same with kiba, shino, choji, Hinata, neji, etc. Their clan powers are what makes them strong. Take that stuff away and they're no better than sakura. And they were also trained by their parents who were all elite ninja. Sakura didn't have that.\n\nAll of these people are still competent fighters without clan techniques and her not having a teacher isn't an excuse.  Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nSakura simply cared more about getting Sasuke's attention than training hence why she sucked. Beating Ino is the only actual noteworthy combat feat she has but Ino gets stomped by the other Genin so its not even all that impressive.\n\n>The average shinobi in naruto doesn't have anything special. There were a 100,000 ninja in the 4th war. Most of them didn't have any special power. They had basic skill that just gets better as they get older.\n\nAnd all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nWe have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful. Sakura's weakness isn't because she's regular.\n\n>When kakashi is teaching them tree climbing and she aces it right away, what does he do? He just sends her back to the house. He doesn't challenge or push her at all.\n\nHe sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\n>And even if she tried who knows if he would train her. Naruto wanted to be trained by kakashi, but he didn't.\n\nHe didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nAnd my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself considering her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.",

Everytime we see these people fight, it's using their clans powers. And even if it wasn't for their powers, they were still raised as kids to be ninja, unlike Sakura.\n\n>Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nNeji is a \"genius\". Naruto has terrible fundamentals and also has natural raw power and was taught by jiraiya, and Sasuke was trained before and is also considered a prodigy and then taught by kakashi. All his power comes from things he was taught as a kid\n\n>And all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nThat's head cannon. And either way, that doesn't even matter. It's still kakashis duty to teach her as her sensei\n\n>We have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful\n\nAnd Sakura is one of them. So why couldn't kakashi do something to teach her earlier. She clearly had potential and that potential wasn't unlocked without training from someone else.\n\n>He sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\nIdk. Walk on water, maybe genjutsu training, or literally anything else. Give her another exercise to learn and challenge her, like a good teacher should. And the fact that she aced it shows she had talent and wasn't \"hopeless\" like you implied.\n\n>He didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nHe is a *squad* leader. His job is to teach *all* his students. He's not a \"master\" like jiraiya who can focus on one kid. Naruto needed training for the neji fight, why not help him with that too?\n\n>her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.\n\nComparing her to a prodigy and a boy who's got inhuman levels of power is hardly fair. Not to mention, they never gain significant strength unless they were specifically taught something by others. Everything else is just basic improvement. Calling Naruto self taught is a bit of a stretch.\n\n>And my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with that. I also think she should've a little done more herself. Thats why I said kakashi only deserves *some* blame. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that kakashi doesn't really teach her *anything*. \n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke wouldn't have made *major* growth if it wasn't for people *teaching* them and telling them what to focus on. Sakura has all the basics down. She needed someone else to teach her how to take it to the next level. Not many characters has done that on their own, and ones that have are considered prodigies.\n\n\nAnd if anything, he should've spent *more* time with her than Naruto and Sasuke if they can teach themselves. As a teacher, he should've focused on the student who needed his help.\n\n\nMy point was simply that kakashi could've/should've done more to teach her as her sensei. You're turning this into something bigger than it is. You're acting like she \"didn't want\" to learn. She's never turned down a lesson from him.",

She also has great analytical skills and chakra control. \n\nIt's an incredibly large part of being a ninja. Analytical skill is nothing without Combat skill. Shikamaru has the combat skill to support his analytical skill hence why he's a threat.\n\nMultiple people throughout part 1 call out her lack of combat ability\n\n>Take away the yamanaka from ino and what is she? Same with kiba, shino, choji, Hinata, neji, etc. Their clan powers are what makes them strong. Take that stuff away and they're no better than sakura. And they were also trained by their parents who were all elite ninja. Sakura didn't have that.\n\nAll of these people are still competent fighters without clan techniques and her not having a teacher isn't an excuse.  Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nSakura simply cared more about getting Sasuke's attention than training hence why she sucked. Beating Ino is the only actual noteworthy combat feat she has but Ino gets stomped by the other Genin so its not even all that impressive.\n\n>The average shinobi in naruto doesn't have anything special. There were a 100,000 ninja in the 4th war. Most of them didn't have any special power. They had basic skill that just gets better as they get older.\n\nAnd all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nWe have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful. Sakura's weakness isn't because she's regular.\n\n>When kakashi is teaching them tree climbing and she aces it right away, what does he do? He just sends her back to the house. He doesn't challenge or push her at all.\n\nHe sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\n>And even if she tried who knows if he would train her. Naruto wanted to be trained by kakashi, but he didn't.\n\nHe didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nAnd my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself considering her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.",

Everytime we see these people fight, it's using their clans powers. And even if it wasn't for their powers, they were still raised as kids to be ninja, unlike Sakura.\n\n>Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nNeji is a \"genius\". Naruto has terrible fundamentals and also has natural raw power and was taught by jiraiya, and Sasuke was trained before and is also considered a prodigy and then taught by kakashi. All his power comes from things he was taught as a kid\n\n>And all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nThat's head cannon. And either way, that doesn't even matter. It's still kakashis duty to teach her as her sensei\n\n>We have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful\n\nAnd Sakura is one of them. So why couldn't kakashi do something to teach her earlier. She clearly had potential and that potential wasn't unlocked without training from someone else.\n\n>He sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\nIdk. Walk on water, maybe genjutsu training, or literally anything else. Give her another exercise to learn and challenge her, like a good teacher should. And the fact that she aced it shows she had talent and wasn't \"hopeless\" like you implied.\n\n>He didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nHe is a *squad* leader. His job is to teach *all* his students. He's not a \"master\" like jiraiya who can focus on one kid. Naruto needed training for the neji fight, why not help him with that too?\n\n>her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.\n\nComparing her to a prodigy and a boy who's got inhuman levels of power is hardly fair. Not to mention, they never gain significant strength unless they were specifically taught something by others. Everything else is just basic improvement. Calling Naruto self taught is a bit of a stretch.\n\n>And my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with that. I also think she should've a little done more herself. Thats why I said kakashi only deserves *some* blame. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that kakashi doesn't really teach her *anything*. \n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke wouldn't have made *major* growth if it wasn't for people *teaching* them and telling them what to focus on. Sakura has all the basics down. She needed someone else to teach her how to take it to the next level. Not many characters has done that on their own, and ones that have are considered prodigies.\n\n\nAnd if anything, he should've spent *more* time with her than Naruto and Sasuke if they can teach themselves. As a teacher, he should've focused on the student who needed his help.\n\n\nMy point was simply that kakashi could've/should've done more to teach her as her sensei. You're turning this into something bigger than it is. You're acting like she \"didn't want\" to learn. She's never turned down a lesson from him.",

She also has great analytical skills and chakra control. \n\nIt's an incredibly large part of being a ninja. Analytical skill is nothing without Combat skill. Shikamaru has the combat skill to support his analytical skill hence why he's a threat.\n\nMultiple people throughout part 1 call out her lack of combat ability\n\n>Take away the yamanaka from ino and what is she? Same with kiba, shino, choji, Hinata, neji, etc. Their clan powers are what makes them strong. Take that stuff away and they're no better than sakura. And they were also trained by their parents who were all elite ninja. Sakura didn't have that.\n\nAll of these people are still competent fighters without clan techniques and her not having a teacher isn't an excuse.  Neji is self taught, Naruto never had a teacher and Sasuke hasn't had one since he was like 7.\n\nSakura simply cared more about getting Sasuke's attention than training hence why she sucked. Beating Ino is the only actual noteworthy combat feat she has but Ino gets stomped by the other Genin so its not even all that impressive.\n\n>The average shinobi in naruto doesn't have anything special. There were a 100,000 ninja in the 4th war. Most of them didn't have any special power. They had basic skill that just gets better as they get older.\n\nAnd all of them were likely better genin than Sakura.\n\nWe have multiple examples of shinobi that don't hail from prestigious clans yet are still incredibly skilled/powerful. Sakura's weakness isn't because she's regular.\n\n>When kakashi is teaching them tree climbing and she aces it right away, what does he do? He just sends her back to the house. He doesn't challenge or push her at all.\n\nHe sends her back to the house because she's aced it and she's exhausted. It was a chakra control day what else was he supposed to teach her?\n\n>And even if she tried who knows if he would train her. Naruto wanted to be trained by kakashi, but he didn't.\n\nHe didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nAnd my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself considering her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.",

And the fact that she aced it shows she had talent and wasn't \"hopeless\" like you implied.\n\n>He didn't train Naruto because he was training Sasuke for the Gaara fight. This is completely different from outright rejecting him.\n\nHe is a *squad* leader. His job is to teach *all* his students. He's not a \"master\" like jiraiya who can focus on one kid. Naruto needed training for the neji fight, why not help him with that too?\n\n>her two teammates are almost entirely self taught.\n\nComparing her to a prodigy and a boy who's got inhuman levels of power is hardly fair. Not to mention, they never gain significant strength unless they were specifically taught something by others. Everything else is just basic improvement. Calling Naruto self taught is a bit of a stretch.\n\n>And my point isn't that she should have asked Kakashi to train her my point is that she never takes the initiative to teach herself\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with that. I also think she should've a little done more herself. Thats why I said kakashi only deserves *some* blame. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that kakashi doesn't really teach her *anything*. \n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke wouldn't have made *major* growth if it wasn't for people *teaching* them and telling them what to focus on. Sakura has all the basics down. She needed someone else to teach her how to take it to the next level. Not many characters has done that on their own, and ones that have are considered prodigies.\n\n\nAnd if anything, he should've spent *more* time with her than Naruto and Sasuke if they can teach themselves. As a teacher, he should've focused on the student who needed his help.\n\n\nMy point was simply that kakashi could've/should've done more to teach her as her sensei.
