    "body": "Here's why. This is an entry on a PUA/\"SB\" blog. \n\n\"-- after a couple of times of paying a SB I  stop the allowance.  If nothing is mentioned we keep seeing each other. I still pay for dates and small gifts. If she is into me it works every time.\"   \nSo these girls enable him because they tolerate this abusive behavior. This pattern is reinforced by his success in getting free pussy and the cycle goes on. \n\nAs Nancy Reagan said \"Just say NO\" . If you want to date a 50 yr old man for free, then by all means go for it. But don't settle for a free meal and cosmetics from Walgreens instead of an allowance. Have some self respect and know your \"worth\".",

I worked for corporations for many years and I sure as sugar would never go to work if i wasn\u2019t sure there was a paycheck at the end of the week. It would not occur to me to not pay my SB for her time because of my history in the working world. But I guess there are some bad apples. I advise NEXT and find an SD with some ethics.",

He seemed dumbfounded and it was honestly hilarious to look back on it. We had just ordered a full dinner. Lol. \n\n\nAnyways! With allowances:\n\nI always gently tell my partner that it\u2019s so gross and unsexy to have to even bring it up, and if it\u2019s not my purse at the beginning of the date I\u2019ll disappear to the bathroom and wait until he puts it in before I get undressed into my lingerie so I don\u2019t have to touch it or think about it. \n\nTruthfully I really do feel that way. Money is dirty and gross, and it\u2019s tasteless to make me ask for it. Disrespect makes my pussy dry up faster than the Sahara, making me feel like an escort is rude as hell. Just pay my allowance before you try to undress me so I can continue with my fantasy that this is a rom-com 90s movie and I\u2019m the plucky alternative female lead who is comfortable in her own skin. \n\n\nIf it\u2019s a regular who is forgetting your allowance, the only thing we are forgetting is the air quotes. Girls, this sugardaddy didn\u2019t \u201cforget\u201d a damn thing, he is renegotiating on your arrangement without your consent. This is 100% unreliable and untrustworthy. \n\n\nAnyone who tries to screw with you financially like this is trash, ESPECIALLY because you had a clear agreement beforehand. I don\u2019t nickle and dime my daddy for the same reasons \u2014 I tried to pressure more allowance from my first sugardaddy and eventually I pressed too hard and he stopped calling me, I never forgot that lesson. \n\n\nSimilarly, the other lesson I learned about allowance is that if you let him get away with this even once it\u2019s all over. Full allowance every time. I recommend throwing any fish like this back into the sea and catching ones that do not smell!",

I always say something, I even had a guy pull out a toy FBI badge on me when he only had $100 out of $500 after dragging out the date for hours and hours and sneaking around clearly trying to find a way to leave without me noticing... I grabbed the badge out of his hand super fast and stuck it in bra and told him to come back with my money, lol he then tried to fight me for it and I pulled my gun out and told him to call the cops and tell them I have his badge. I knew he had coke in his pocket so he wasn\u2019t calling anybody and he def wasn\u2019t a cop anyway, but it was nuts! Screw that, nobody\u2019s robbing me, period, atleast not without a sick confrontation and a headache to boot, lol I eventually let him leave n kept the badge as a souvenir, but I would have chased his car down n pushed him off the road if it got to that tbh, I keeps a v8! lol\ud83d\ude02",

While you may think it's a given that an SB would only be there for the cash, a lot of SDs are looking for a real connection.\n* To see if the relationship has moved past the stage where you don't trust them.\n* To see if the relationship has moved past the stage where they only see you as a piece of flesh they paid for. Sometimes this leads to much more generosity because maybe their level of respect and appreciation is growing.\n* Because maybe they feel they are offering you other things that exceed the value of the cash.\n* Because maybe the SB did a really poor job of setting boundaries and her own expectations of him.\n\nThe only things disgusting here is a lack of empathy for the other side. Some might call the SD \\*disgusting\\* because they think it's only happening to deprive them of something. It might be, but it could be some of these other reasons above. I agree that it would be disgusting if they only stop paying just to abuse the power they have in the relationship (lack of empathy for the SB) but I don't assume that's always the case.",
