Also Kang Gary was typically the member I expected to be the one to be able to beat KJK.\n\nGranted, LKS was on the show longer and so had more opportunity to tear KJK's name tag, but I actually question this on the numbers.\n\nAnd then there are the numerous times where KJK gets ganged up on and one of the many hands get to get the tear. In those cases, LKS probably had the advantage with his longer reach but it's hard to get a real count without doing the actual count.",
