    "body": "So for the past 4 months I've *basically* been living with my SD, a couple weeks ago he asked me if I wanted to make things (privately) official and move in! I was both scared and excited, it seemed a bit fast and a bit much, but last week the best thing happened... He was talking with his neighbour and they're looking to sell their house! I've been saving up for years and it's in my price range. We talked about it quite a bit and the seller was keen to make a private sale so we've been able to sort things quite quickly. \n\nJust wanted to say something here cause I can't tell my family the half of it. Buying a house is exciting enough, but having the freedom, independence, and closeness of living next to your boyfriend is going to be so perfect. \n\nAlso worth noting- he's recently bought some land one street over to build his dream home, so he'll be moving there in a couple years once it's built. (Meaning if things didn't work out between us we wouldn't be neighbors forever, and if they do then I'll still only be a minute away)\n\nI'm going to our lawyers to sign paperwork tomorrow. So excited for all the sneaky shenanigans to come! Literally the girl next door \ud83d\ude02",
