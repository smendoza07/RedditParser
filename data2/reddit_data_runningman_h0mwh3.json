For example, you hardly see her in the broadcast footage, most likely because she\u2019s been edited out probably for lack of enthusiasm. And when you do see her, she\u2019s just...there. Also when she\u2019s playing games, she\u2019s like putting bare minimum effort unlike before. I dunno, I hope she\u2019s ok. It just seems like she would rather be elsewhere. Maybe contract obligations at this point.",
