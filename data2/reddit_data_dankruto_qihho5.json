Even if you have him edo tensei (which he couldn\u2019t use anyway since has no sacrifice) minato could stop it. Minato also has sage mode which is a huge power boost and great for sensing any surprise attacks. Tobirama IMO is smarter than Minato so maybe he could put smart him and get off the reanimation.

Even if you have him edo tensei (which he couldn\u2019t use anyway since has no sacrifice) minato could stop it. Minato also has sage mode which is a huge power boost and great for sensing any surprise attacks. Tobirama IMO is smarter than Minato so maybe he could put smart him and get off the reanimation. Also why are you putting in so many conditions? A fair fight is both fighters going in with what they have not them being nerfed or buffed to be even",

Even if you have him edo tensei (which he couldn\u2019t use anyway since has no sacrifice) minato could stop it.

Even if you have him edo tensei (which he couldn\u2019t use anyway since has no sacrifice) minato could stop it. Minato also has sage mode which is a huge power boost and great for sensing any surprise attacks. Tobirama IMO is smarter than Minato so maybe he could put smart him and get off the reanimation. Also why are you putting in so many conditions? A fair fight is both fighters going in with what they have not them being nerfed or buffed to be even",
