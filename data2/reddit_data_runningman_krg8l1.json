He has a lot of interest in other people\u2019s business, and he is unable to hold back when he sees injustice because he was born with a chivalrous personality. Oh Gyu Tae also has **extraordinary athletic abilities** because he learned **boxing** as a hobby since a young age.\u201d\n\nInteresting character description. Does this mean he\u2019ll have to hit the gym again?",

Dramas are usually much more demanding in terms of time and energy than movies. An actor has to shoot a lot more scenes in one day. That is especially true for leading roles. The last time we was in a drama it was Live and i remember that shooting both the drama and RM wast taking a toll on him, he got super skinny back then. Hopefully he can take good care of his health. \n\nBut this is exciting news and the plot seems interesting. I am sure i'll check it out when the drama comes out.",
