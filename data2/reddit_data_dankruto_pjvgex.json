The second, and sort of more compelling, is that while in reality him and kisame would have been able to best jiraiya, it made much more sense for him to pretend as though he is stronger than he is compared to them so that he would have excuse for not being able to catch Naruto. Basically, he can go back to pain and be like \"jiraiya was with them he would've killed us.\" Which may just be the case tbh",

There's no way those 2 lose to Jiraiya. They're almost a perfect pair. Kisame is the brawler who just has so much raw strength and insane chakra that he's just alot to handle even for a squad which allows Itachi to spam fire/genjutsu/shuriken. If need be Itachi uses MS and basically one shots the opponent if they're busy with Kisame",

But the question is why Itachi didn't fight Nagato to stop Akastski.\n\nThe answer is that he thinks that ninja God Madara (Tobi) is in charge and fighting Pein wouldn't do anything.\n\nYou are right that the Rinagan is powerful. But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Even if Jiraya goes sage mode, itachi posses two jutsu that **no one** knows he has.\n\n1. Susano with very quiet, insta-stabby blade (Ask Oro and Kabu how that went.)\n\n\n2. **Kotoafreakingmatsukami** (He was **literally** unbeatable at that point.) (3 mangekyo = 3 izanagi/izanami)\n\nThe guy beat Orochimaru in his most powerful form. Anyone really brave enough to say he cannot beat seal release Tsunade by herself?\nWhat makes Jiraiya any different? Who did kishimoto decide to pair itachi with during war arc? Nagato. Who defeated sage mode Kabuto? Itachi. Who else did itachi fight, save, and could one shot individually? 9 & 8 tails Jinjuriki. Who was Obito and Danzo scared of? Itachi. \n\nThat was an unfair fight for Jiraiya. Not to mention Itachi was meant to be a boss battle for Sasuke. Being weaker than Jiraiya kinda nullifies that. Lastly the sannin are reflections of our protagonists (team 7). Their main strength and the reason they were almost unbeatable came from the fact that they **worked together.** Individually they are just really strong people.\n\nDon't even get me started on the \"back-up\" line.",

Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao. He\u2019s f\u2019ed up and he even realized it later. \n\nRegardless, I don\u2019t get how this at all ties into why they flee against Jiraiya.

He had perfect sage mode with the frogs and the data books say that the frog song is the strongest genjutsu. It doesn't say if it's strongest compared to normal genjutsu or all genjutsu including mangekyo, but its still insanely strong and even works on the renigan. And if we are to assume he has a basic knowledge of the sharigan and itachis abilities (which he should since he's a sanin and has likely faced Uchiha before or atleast worked with them) then he could probably bring itachi to a stalemate, since I belive kishimoto said himself that if jiraiya knew about pains abilities, then he would've beat him. And im a firm believer that pain is stronger then itachi. I mean itachis mangekyo has nothing on the renigan, especially not someone who utilizes the renigan to its fullest potential like nagato. Who is easily the best renigan wielder we've seen besides otsosuki.",

But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense. Madara should have had Nagato/Obito use the Rinnagan to revive him as soon as he died, then he could go around getting all the tailed beasts himself. \n\nSo not only was Itachi missing all of the information, but the plan itself doesn't make sense.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Even if Jiraya goes sage mode, itachi posses two jutsu that **no one** knows he has.\n\n1. Susano with very quiet, insta-stabby blade (Ask Oro and Kabu how that went.)\n\n\n2. **Kotoafreakingmatsukami** (He was **literally** unbeatable at that point.) (3 mangekyo = 3 izanagi/izanami)\n\nThe guy beat Orochimaru in his most powerful form. Anyone really brave enough to say he cannot beat seal release Tsunade by herself?\nWhat makes Jiraiya any different? Who did kishimoto decide to pair itachi with during war arc? Nagato. Who defeated sage mode Kabuto? Itachi. Who else did itachi fight, save, and could one shot individually? 9 & 8 tails Jinjuriki. Who was Obito and Danzo scared of? Itachi. \n\nThat was an unfair fight for Jiraiya. Not to mention Itachi was meant to be a boss battle for Sasuke. Being weaker than Jiraiya kinda nullifies that. Lastly the sannin are reflections of our protagonists (team 7). Their main strength and the reason they were almost unbeatable came from the fact that they **worked together.** Individually they are just really strong people.\n\nDon't even get me started on the \"back-up\" line.",

Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao. He\u2019s f\u2019ed up and he even realized it later. \n\nRegardless, I don\u2019t get how this at all ties into why they flee against Jiraiya.

Orochimaru never said it was impossible for him to defeat Itachi, merely that he considered Itachi to be stronger than him, but he said the same of Hiruzen. Itachi bested Orochimaru both times by exploiting his two weaknesses and catching him off guard. In a straight up fight, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\n\nOrochimaru keeps pace easily with Hiruzen, when Edo Hiruzen (ergo weaker), had reactions faster than Minato and his speed wasn\u2019t much lower.\n\nNagato outright says Sage Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he knew about the Paths, which puts it as Sage Jiraiya>Sage Naruto, who would absolutely stomp Itachi.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t even need to go into Tsunade, who could avoid attacks from Madara and broke his Susano\u2019o.",

But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense. Madara should have had Nagato/Obito use the Rinnagan to revive him as soon as he died, then he could go around getting all the tailed beasts himself. \n\nSo not only was Itachi missing all of the information, but the plan itself doesn't make sense.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao. He\u2019s f\u2019ed up and he even realized it later. \n\nRegardless, I don\u2019t get how this at all ties into why they flee against Jiraiya.

But the question is why Itachi didn't fight Nagato to stop Akastski.\n\nThe answer is that he thinks that ninja God Madara (Tobi) is in charge and fighting Pein wouldn't do anything.\n\nYou are right that the Rinagan is powerful. But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense. Madara should have had Nagato/Obito use the Rinnagan to revive him as soon as he died, then he could go around getting all the tailed beasts himself. \n\nSo not only was Itachi missing all of the information, but the plan itself doesn't make sense.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Kakashi even notes \u201che could kill me if he wanted, why doesn\u2019t he\u201d. \nAnd again, he has to play the role of Akatsuki under cover. \n\n\nFor Sasuke, his motives were to reinforce Sasuke\u2019s hatred against him. Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao. He\u2019s f\u2019ed up and he even realized it later. \n\nRegardless, I don\u2019t get how this at all ties into why they flee against Jiraiya. Itachi seeded the excuse, and then fled, all while not tipping off Kisame (though he still had mild questioning) and reinforcing his status as \u201cevil\u201d to the leaf and Sasuke",

But the question is why Itachi didn't fight Nagato to stop Akastski.\n\nThe answer is that he thinks that ninja God Madara (Tobi) is in charge and fighting Pein wouldn't do anything.\n\nYou are right that the Rinagan is powerful. But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

After all, from Itachi's perspective, if Madara wanted the eyes why didn't he take them?\n\nItachi would have to deduce so many things for it to make sense. He would have to figure out \n\n* that Madara survived. \n* That Hashirma cells + Mangyeku = Rinnagan. \n* That Madara gave them to Nagato. \n* That Tobi is Obito, not Madara. \n* That the Rinnagan can bring people back to life (which was essential to the plan until Kabuto).\n* That Madara will use the Rinnagan, put the 9 tailed beasts into the 10 tail, put the 10 tail into himself, sprout a plant that's the source of all chakra and use it to cast a genjutsu on everyone from the moon.\n\nYa. Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense. Madara should have had Nagato/Obito use the Rinnagan to revive him as soon as he died, then he could go around getting all the tailed beasts himself. \n\nSo not only was Itachi missing all of the information, but the plan itself doesn't make sense.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao. He\u2019s f\u2019ed up and he even realized it later. \n\nRegardless, I don\u2019t get how this at all ties into why they flee against Jiraiya.

But the question is why Itachi didn't fight Nagato to stop Akastski.\n\nThe answer is that he thinks that ninja God Madara (Tobi) is in charge and fighting Pein wouldn't do anything.\n\nYou are right that the Rinagan is powerful. But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

After all, from Itachi's perspective, if Madara wanted the eyes why didn't he take them?\n\nItachi would have to deduce so many things for it to make sense. He would have to figure out \n\n* that Madara survived. \n* That Hashirma cells + Mangyeku = Rinnagan. \n* That Madara gave them to Nagato. \n* That Tobi is Obito, not Madara. \n* That the Rinnagan can bring people back to life (which was essential to the plan until Kabuto).\n* That Madara will use the Rinnagan, put the 9 tailed beasts into the 10 tail, put the 10 tail into himself, sprout a plant that's the source of all chakra and use it to cast a genjutsu on everyone from the moon.\n\nYa. Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense. Madara should have had Nagato/Obito use the Rinnagan to revive him as soon as he died, then he could go around getting all the tailed beasts himself. \n\nSo not only was Itachi missing all of the information, but the plan itself doesn't make sense.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Kakashi even notes \u201che could kill me if he wanted, why doesn\u2019t he\u201d. \nAnd again, he has to play the role of Akatsuki under cover. \n\n\nFor Sasuke, his motives were to reinforce Sasuke\u2019s hatred against him. Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao. He\u2019s f\u2019ed up and he even realized it later. \n\nRegardless, I don\u2019t get how this at all ties into why they flee against Jiraiya. Itachi seeded the excuse, and then fled, all while not tipping off Kisame (though he still had mild questioning) and reinforcing his status as \u201cevil\u201d to the leaf and Sasuke",

But the question is why Itachi didn't fight Nagato to stop Akastski.\n\nThe answer is that he thinks that ninja God Madara (Tobi) is in charge and fighting Pein wouldn't do anything.\n\nYou are right that the Rinagan is powerful. But so far as Itachi knows, it wouldn't do anything to derail Akatski. It takes away one of Madara's weapons sure. But Nagato isn't on Madara's level. \n\nSo given what Itachi knows what would he gain by killing Nagato? He would take away the most powerful dojutsu. But Madara is so strong that Nagato doesn't matter much more than Sasori. So now Itachi kills Nagato but he still doesn't know Madara's master plan and Madara will kill him before he can do anything to stop Akatski.\n\nTo be fair, how is he supposed to know that Madara needs the Rinagan for his plan? To know that he would have to know that they were Madara's eyes, that Tobi isn't Madara, and that Madara/Tobi's plan revolves around a ringan genjutsu.\n\nBut since he doesn't know that...",

After all, from Itachi's perspective, if Madara wanted the eyes why didn't he take them?\n\nItachi would have to deduce so many things for it to make sense. He would have to figure out \n\n* that Madara survived. \n* That Hashirma cells + Mangyeku = Rinnagan. \n* That Madara gave them to Nagato. \n* That Tobi is Obito, not Madara. \n* That the Rinnagan can bring people back to life (which was essential to the plan until Kabuto).\n* That Madara will use the Rinnagan, put the 9 tailed beasts into the 10 tail, put the 10 tail into himself, sprout a plant that's the source of all chakra and use it to cast a genjutsu on everyone from the moon.\n\nYa. Itachi is a genius. But he couldn't figure that out. Partially because he is missing info about Madara, Obito, and the Rinnagan...but mostly because the plan doesn't make much sense. Madara should have had Nagato/Obito use the Rinnagan to revive him as soon as he died, then he could go around getting all the tailed beasts himself. \n\nSo not only was Itachi missing all of the information, but the plan itself doesn't make sense. Ya know?",

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

Sure, you could argue, \u201cthat seems like too much\u201d, but remember, Itachi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of the reader in knowing Sasuke\u2019s level of determination or how much hatred he has. \n\nAdditionally, it is Itachi\u2019s entire reason for LIVING to get Sasuke to hate him and get him strong enough to kill him. It\u2019s not something he\u2019s going to half-ass. He wants to the best of the his ability to ENSURE it. He needs to strong arm it. No one is arguing for Itachi\u2019s moral perfection here lmao.

And others are calling the disease cancer/aids but we have no idea what the illness actually is or how it impacts Itachi\u2019s body. Also, it\u2019s clear that he is able to fight against his illness and his blindness to an extent as we see in the feats he performs during the final fight\n\nThat interpretation makes the most sense to me, but in the end Kishimoto often likes to briefly show snips of things instead of fleshing them out entirely so it\u2019s hard to say for certain what is going on with the illness and the arm - and I can also understand your interpretation of the scenes as well. I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",

I did read somewhere that some ronin keep their arm in a similar position, but the illness along with Sasuke\u2019s remarks makes the most sense to me",
