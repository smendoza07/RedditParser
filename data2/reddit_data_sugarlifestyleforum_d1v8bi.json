    "body": "...okay but it IS a transaction? Everything about human nature screams transaction. I\u2019m a very gentle and kind person but even when I do nice things for others I\u2019m getting something out of it, even if it\u2019s just intrinsic reward. I find it very irritating when POT refuse to talk details because they don\u2019t want to think about the transaction. There will be a transaction involved, and that\u2019s totally okay! That\u2019s why we\u2019re here, yeah? It doesn\u2019t make either of us less of a person, it\u2019s just a non traditional relationship that\u2019s mutually beneficial!!!\nRant over.",

It\u2019s like none of these men want to help me financially unless I have sex with them! To avoid the transactional nature I think it would be great for you to just help me with my current past due bills and then we can slowly get to know each other.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude02",

I've been tested a lot in this lifestyle. My real beliefs and what I will stay strong on have been exposed, to me. Some things I have done, not just for money mind you, being open to adventures and in the bowl exposes you to some interesting people. I've also been asked to do things I am opposed to, offered really obscene amounts of money, and I said \"No\", not a hypothetical I'm-sure-I'd-say-no, a real no.

A sugar relationship with a regular partner is supposed to avoid the transactional feeling.  If I do pay but she acts more like an escort than a SB, I would feel the relationship is transactional. My SRs have worked well when I sense she is genuinely excited to be with me, I mean more to her than just the allowance and (while I don't look for exclusivity), her schedule and nature are such that she's not into multiple relationships.  \n\nI don't like being in a position where I have to be the highest bidder to qualify to be her SD, where her body language indicates disinterest and the only thing that matters to her is the allowance.",

He finally convinced her that he was not paying her to have sex, he was paying her to not have sex with other guys.  They started out with a small PPM and he was so happy that he increased the payment and the meeting time.  Then he gave her a big chunk of cash to go on vacation for two weeks with him and when they came back, he increased the payment and he made her an employee of his company and she received direct deposits to her bank.  As their relationship progressed, they developed their own kinks and for the SD, her being married became a kink for him.  As he got her into doing anal and deep throat, his kinks expanded and finally he got her into talking \"potty mouth\".  One  day he called me and said, \" She is your wife, but she is my whore\", they had gone to a new level for sure. Life is not static.",
