I really enjoyed all the episodes leading up to it, from learning the dance to writing songs with their collab artists. Then finally seeing them do the group dance I had chills running up and down my body. Particularly proud of Jihyo and Sukjin here: Jihyo for doing amazing while after looking rather stiff during practice, Sukjin for being able to keep up with the young ones at his age. I still really like to listen to all the collab songs too, especially Jaesuk and Somin with Soran which is my favorite.",
