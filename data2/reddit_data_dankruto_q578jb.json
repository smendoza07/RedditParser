                    "body": "Honestly there's zero excuse whatsoever for shit like this in Boruto. I'm tired of seeing how nerfed Naruto and Sasuke have become just for the sole purpose of focusing more heavily on Boruto and Kawaki and allowing them to surpass their \"mentors\". The writers literally had to make those two into fucking alien hybrids and then nerf the absolute fuck out of Naruto and Sasuke in order to justify the kids becoming stronger than them. Wtf happened to them being \"destined\" for greatness or whatever tf? (PS This topic kinda pisses me off due to the missed potential and how long I've been a Naruto fan so this'll be a bit of a long rant)\n\n**Both** Naruto and Sasuke should have Hashi cell arms, and they should have Wood Style as a result (Naruto should already have it from his Hashi cell arm). Naruto should've become almost twice as strong as he was at the end of Shippuden anyway b/c now he has Minato's half of Kurama. Though he doesn't really show it.\n\nAnd while we're at it, if Naruto had been implanted with cells from Madara then he could've gotten Rinnegan too. Having 2 Rinnegan users would be an enormous help to the village. Also why hasn't Naruto improved as a shinobi at all? I get that he needs to do his Hokage work but doesn't making sure he is best primed to defend the village from threats like Otsutsuki (after dealing with Toneri he knows there's more than just Hagoromo and Kaguya and a strong enough possibility that there's even more than them so the excuse that he thought he was done with them doesn't hold up) should've been a high priority. Why not master some of the other natural Nature Releases (on top of having Wood Style which was unique to him, Hashirama had mastered all 5 of the basic ones AND Yin and Yang, Madara had all those and even used Storm Release), or some of the several Kekkei Genkai he gained through the other Bijuu's Chakra. Technically, since he can use Truth Seeking Orbs, he should theoretically be able to use literally any Kekkei Genkai Release in existence and potentially even make more of them. It's possible he could even use/create Kekkei Tota Releases.\n\nWhen those two fought at Final Valley, Sasuke had only just gotten his Rinnegan, which takes time to get accustomed to, and Naruto had only just gotten his SOSP Chakra from Hagoromo. They were fighting while very much handicapped by lack of experience. By adulthood, they should not only be much more powerful than Madara and Hashirama, but they should also be just as good if not better *shinobi* as well. After all, they did all that in the War when they were only fucking 16 years old, practically children. They've had 2 decades to improve their skills. So why in the **FUCK** does only Sasuke even show a higher level of ability than he did in the fucking War 20 years ago??? Has Naruto even used his Truth Seeking Orbs since then? Dude STILL only knows Rasengan/Rasenshuriken, Shadow Clone, and Summoning Jutsu even as an adult??? That shit's downright embarrassing, let alone for him to be a Hokage. And somehow his SOSP mode looks as though it's weaker than it was before too, if that's even possible. His senses, in combination with Kurama's, should be extremely fine tuned, to where he almost never gets blindsided by anything. That goes doubly for Sasuke who should've been able to dodge Borushiki from the millisecond his foot left the ground. It drives me nuts the level of fights and ability we could've seen from these two but was swept under the rug/tossed right out the window just so that Boruto could have his show and he and his generation could definitely go on to surpass the previous generation.\n\nFuck that.\n\nIt's already established that Naruto and Sasuke are supposed to be the saviours of humanity. Hell, they were predestined from birth to be the greatest. And by all means, they had every possibility to become that, and an insurmountable wall for every shinobi born before the next Ashura and Indra reincarnations (if Kishi really wanted to make a sequel series to Naruto why not focus it on them?). But in this state, I honestly doubt Naruto could beat SOSP Chakra Hashi even if he is stronger by now b/c Hashi'd have much better Jutsu and general skill as well as battle intelligence, or that Sasuke could beat SOSP Chakra + Wood Style Madara. Juubidara or Juubito are entirely out of the question, they'd destroy Naruto or Sasuke 1v1. And that really shouldn't be the case.\n\nSorry for the rant, this just riles me up tbh.",

                                    "body": "Honestly not really. At least we've seen him use some of the more fundamental paths of the Rinnegan like Planetary Devastation. Naruto has Hashi cells implanted in his body and literally doesn't bother learning or using Wood Style. He has Truth Seeker orbs and thus has access to literally any Nature Release we've ever seen in the entire series and doesn't use any of them. That includes the Kekkei Genkai and Kekkei Tota ones like Dust, Boil, Storm, Lava, etc, but even without using him he has directly used several through the ones he got from the other Bijuus' Chakra. \n\nSasuke improved his skill as a shinobi during his time with Orochimaru, and between the timeskip and the end of Shippuden. However Naruto spent much of that time, including the timeskip, creating Rasenshuriken, learning Sage Mode/how to use nature energy, and becoming one with Kurama. So he didn't necessarily have as much of a chance to learn more Jutsus and master more Nature Releases and stuff. But in the time since the end of Shippuden he definitely should've. Becoming as strong as possible is extremely important as Hokage, so he can deal with any number of unpredictable situations. To only ever really have mastered Wind Release is ridiculous. \n\nAnd think of the possibilities too, since the Truthseeker Orbs take the necessity of 'affinity' out of the equation. So he could theoretically create a Change of Form Rasengan for other Nature Releases than just Wind (Rasenshuriken). But with all these possibilities in hand the writers either got overwhelmed or didn't care to make Naruto competent, and thus we have this devolved bum who now is gonna probably be useless for the rest of the series.",

Like he was spamming mountain sized meteors without a problem. And the abilities we've seen he had before that were amazing, but we never seen him at full power, like what he could do with the third eye.\n\nSo yah if he wasn't betrayed by Zetsu, Naruto and Sasuke would most likely have lost since even before all the powerups they got easily beaten by Madara, his taijutsu was far better than them.\n\nPeople and mostly Boruto fans like to say that Momoshiki and Ishiki are stronger than Madara, but the feats Madara shown are planetary, while Isshiki and Momoshiki never shown any of this feats.\n\nKishimoto haxed Madara too much and thinking about it there was no way for Naruto and Sasuke to beat him up. Like from the start they tried to seal him cause the damage they were inflicting to him was healed immediately.\n\nSo Black Zetsu betraying him was a good idea, but it was poorly executed.",

Remember all dojutsu in Naruto  is just a mix of human and Otosuski DNA and chakra so I mean it's not like they don't understand or know about any techniques or abilities   with humans who basically are mutts of their power.sharingan is not an Otosuski thing it's just a mutt version of the  rinne Sharingan. Byakugan in the hyugas can only do so much while Otusukis Byakugan have multiple abilities not to mention the tensigan which is basically the upgraded Byakugan which no human can obtain ,and rinnegan have basic abilities unless you truly master your rinnegan and even then, Otosuski rinnegan still to an extent.can overpower any human who has obtained the rinnegan. \nI agree it was bad writing and execution for Black Zetsu Betraying Madara though that shit was wack -.-\nHowever I still kinda think Naruto and Sasuke could have taken Madara. It just would have been harder because he had waaay more battle experience then Kaguya.",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo.

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

Kishi clearly didn't have a goal in mind with Madara (other than to lose eventually), and it sucks that everything became ridiculous by the end. The Kaguya reveal should've happened way earlier to make it less of a ripoff. Or have Naruto/Sasuke starting to win the fight, and then Zetsu could slip in and take over due to the weakened Madara.\n\nObviously it's easier for us to rewrite scenes when we don't have deadlines to fulfill, but it sucks that the flip from Madara to Kaguya was so janky. Almost like it was a second thought by Kishi to make the sequel have even higher stakes by introducing aliens. The war arc basically broke any believable earthly force being able to compete with Madara, Obito, Sasuke, Naruto, etc. Having the power scaling drop could've made Boruto way more interesting and believable that he could surpass Naruto, without crippling Naruto and Sasuke's abilities. Baryon was amazing to watch/read, but the fight itself wasn't planet level destruction, just basic Tai jutsu, basically, which is easy to translate to every ninja.",

Boruto right now gets stomped easily by any jonin, but Momoshiki is who brings the power level up. \n\nYou must've read/watched a different Naruto, or you're being biased, because fights were paced pretty similarly, which the same level of strategy. You don't have to like Boruto, but the writing has stayed pretty consistent, even if the plot gets weird. \n\nAlso, Naruto and Sasuke were taking on the Akatsuki and winning. They were powered up throughout the series, and surpassed the previous generation pretty early, other than people like Kakashi and Guy, which were surpassed at the end like you said.",

I guess we need to give it another near half decade for it to upgrade from trash to barely tolerable as an anime. \n\nBut then they tell you to read the manga where you got Ikemoto's creep ass drawing Sumire and Sarada like 12 year old hookers as if it's any better. The same power scaling and nerf/character assassination issues exist, just more condensed because the manga literally only has 43 chapters so far whereas the anime is like 90% filler just to keep it airing weekly.\n\nSo yeah they're right, the manga is technically better than the anime because while they are both piles of shit, the manga is a much smaller pile",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent. Its so badly written like what kind of ability is that to take away your opponent life points like in a game.\n\nIt doesn't even last long, and is the worst excuse of a form to take out Kurama.",

Baryon mode Naruto can barely put a fist sized dent in the ground. The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime.

I was giving reasoning as to why people say Naruto is nerfed. I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

They easily beat Momo. Boruto, injured Sasuke, Jiraya and Kid Naruto beat Urashiki. Sasuke held his own against Kinshiki. \n\nI guess the reason why Jigen was so strong is because he absorbed some of the 10 tails chakra, which makes sense. \n\nBut Sasuke and Naruto handled Juubito, So6P Madara and Kaguya, who were all the 10 Tails Jinchuriki. \n\nThe power scaling is askew.",

Sasuke literally mentioned how he has gotten stronger as his control over the rinnegan has gotten better, and that was in his fight with Naruto a single day after he got his new abilities, yet you think it\u2019s weird to assume that he got stronger after 15 or so years.                                               His control of his rinnigan had gotten way better as an adult, where he can open portals casually, and he can fight on par with Naruto against Momoshiki, who also is a lot stronger than he was in the war arc. Contrary to what it would seem, opening such a portal takes massive amounts of chakra, yet he could still keep up with Momoshiki in his fused form after using a portal for multiple people.        \n\nNo offense but your opinion is useless if you think he got weaker after 15 years of training and honing his abilities",

This is just a stupid excuse for the garbage show to nerf naruto and sasuke at the same time . \n\nThey even throw things out of the window that could\u2019ve protected the situation . \n\nLike if sasuke is so badly in need of chakra absorb some from fucking naruto ! He has the kyuubi and he is an uzumaki .....\n\nSasuke absorbed chakra in the final fight against naruto so why woudnt he do that in this scenario if he so badly needs it ? \n\nDoesn\u2019t make Any sense whatsoever, apart from the fact that the boruto creators are desperately ruining their characters. \n\nNaruto didn\u2019t use a single bijuu dama in the entirety of boruto ? Ishiki can absorb them yes , but the impact of the will surely do something you don\u2019t now if you don\u2019t try . \n\nThen sasuke who is a deductive genius gets reduced to a punching bag ..... \n\nShit makes no sense . \n\nFor all you people claiming to be naruto fans . Please resign support this garbage show and stop associate yourselves with the naruto fandom . Boruto is just so great at everything it does . \n\nIt has to ruin the main part of the show that\u2019s actually watchable by pulling stupid shit like this . \n\nMy rant is done thx \ud83d\ude4f",

The side characters are treated like shit whereas in Naruto side characters were really well treated(way better in OG than Shippuden). Boruto as a MC isnt exciting which is another huge issue. So yeah it has some positives but the negatives outweigh the positives by a big margin. My favorite part of Boruto so far has been the relation between Naruto and Kawaki.

Sasuke, at this point, had almost died and had no chakra. The battle was over, so his defenses were naturally down.

At that point with Madara, he had absorbed Hashirama's Senjutsu, so he wouldn't need an eye to sense the attack coming.

I'm not denying that, but it was also set up properly in context. Even if he still had chakra to use Amaterasu once after, it wasn't enough to keep his guard up and keep sensing around him.\n\nYou can hate the show all you want, and that's fine. It sure has its problems. However, even if he had chakra left over, he wouldn't be constantly sensing his surroundings. Otsutsukis can suppress their chakra, meaning they can't be sensed, even by people with chakra, so it doesn't matter if he had chakra or not. He had been stabbed dozens and dozens of times and strangled. The fight was over. You're comparing Madara with senjutsu with a beat-up post-fight Sasuke. I mean yeah, plot was a big part of it, sure. I'm not arguing that, but it made sense in context too. They're not excuses. It's natural context needed to understand the situation.",

Like Sasuke's actions were completely justified too... He knew he could turn into Borushiki, but why in the hell would he suspect Boruto of suddenly turning into Borushiki? It's not reasonable to be on your guard at all times. No one does that. I don't understand where you're coming up with these exaggerations. He had no time to teleport at all. He was staring at Naruto, not Boruto. That was an error in animation at least. He was staring at Naruto, asking him what Baryon was when he turned to hear the sound coming at him and as soon as he turned, he was stabbed in the eye. He didn't even have time to see Borushiki coming at him. What do you mean? It's not reasonable for Sasuke to do all these things and on his guard, ready to fight Boruto, when honestly he had just been stabbed 20 times, strangled, and was exhausted out of his mind. No one in their right mind would be ready for another fight out of left field when they were on the brink of death. That makes no sense. It would be way too Gary Sue-ish if Sasuke suddenly sensed and reacted to everything 0.5 seconds before they happened to him. He had no time at all.\n\nAll I'm saying is that it's not fair to compare Sage of Six Paths Senjutsu Reborn Madara with an exhausted stabbed-20x strangled and beaten Sasuke. It's not a very fair comparison is all. Also, Sasuke didn't have his eyes active, so he couldn't have time to activate them and then teleport around.",

Also, Madara is more aware of his surroundings at that time, considering he was in the middle of the battlefield, plus he has Senjutsu so he has all that Kumite thing (im assuming this coz Naruto also has it. Could be wrong). \n\nSasuke has none of those things and was just beaten up like a twat. Sure, he has the Sharingan but he doesn't have it activated right now. I think it's justified that he loses his Rinnegan here but, at the same time, he does seem a lot weaker now than he should be. I think it might be coz we saw Boruto kick Momoshiki's ass when these gods couldn't do much.",

At this point, Sasuke had been beaten to almost death and quite literally almost died like 3 times. He had no chakra and was completely fatigued. Neither Naruto, nor Sasuke, could barely move.\n3. Borushiki had no chakra that could be sensed by others, so he'd be hard to track down, especially if it was from behind in a complete curveball twist that Sasuke couldn't have predicted or expected. Madara, on the other hand, had his defenses up, while Sasuke had none of his defenses up.",

Heroes always lose their powers(Notice how it happened to Naruto and Sasuke). \n\nI feel like later down the line Hagoromo will come in clutch and give Sasuke/Naruto their stuff back. Kinda like a \u201cThis is your last chance guys, I won\u2019t be able to give it back if you lose them again.\u201d\n\nPlus the Shonen narrative of surpassing the old generation would be disrespected if Boruto/Kawaki have to surpass them at their weakest. Their clearly going to have to get older and surpass them at their strongest. That\u2019s what Shonen usually does. \n\nSo yeah I\u2019m bummed out but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be permanent.

Isshiki kicked his ass and then strangled and stabbed him, if I'm not mistaken.\n3. \rAt that point with Madara, he had absorbed Hashirama's Senjutsu, so he wouldn't need an eye to sense the attack coming. Also, Madara was not as badly injured as Sasuke and had more chakra for sure.\r\n4. At this point in the manga, Kishimoto had returned and was writing the manga\n\nI'm just saying... it's not fair to compare a Sage of Six Paths Reborn Senjutsu Madara with a beaten-down, stabbed-20x, strangled, exhausted Sasuke who did not have his eyes active.",

            "body": "Honestly there's zero excuse whatsoever for shit like this in Boruto. I'm tired of seeing how nerfed Naruto and Sasuke have become just for the sole purpose of focusing more heavily on Boruto and Kawaki and allowing them to surpass their \"mentors\". The writers literally had to make those two into fucking alien hybrids and then nerf the absolute fuck out of Naruto and Sasuke in order to justify the kids becoming stronger than them. Wtf happened to them being \"destined\" for greatness or whatever tf? (PS This topic kinda pisses me off due to the missed potential and how long I've been a Naruto fan so this'll be a bit of a long rant)\n\n**Both** Naruto and Sasuke should have Hashi cell arms, and they should have Wood Style as a result (Naruto should already have it from his Hashi cell arm). Naruto should've become almost twice as strong as he was at the end of Shippuden anyway b/c now he has Minato's half of Kurama. Though he doesn't really show it.\n\nAnd while we're at it, if Naruto had been implanted with cells from Madara then he could've gotten Rinnegan too. Having 2 Rinnegan users would be an enormous help to the village. Also why hasn't Naruto improved as a shinobi at all? I get that he needs to do his Hokage work but doesn't making sure he is best primed to defend the village from threats like Otsutsuki (after dealing with Toneri he knows there's more than just Hagoromo and Kaguya and a strong enough possibility that there's even more than them so the excuse that he thought he was done with them doesn't hold up) should've been a high priority. Why not master some of the other natural Nature Releases (on top of having Wood Style which was unique to him, Hashirama had mastered all 5 of the basic ones AND Yin and Yang, Madara had all those and even used Storm Release), or some of the several Kekkei Genkai he gained through the other Bijuu's Chakra. Technically, since he can use Truth Seeking Orbs, he should theoretically be able to use literally any Kekkei Genkai Release in existence and potentially even make more of them. It's possible he could even use/create Kekkei Tota Releases.\n\nWhen those two fought at Final Valley, Sasuke had only just gotten his Rinnegan, which takes time to get accustomed to, and Naruto had only just gotten his SOSP Chakra from Hagoromo. They were fighting while very much handicapped by lack of experience. By adulthood, they should not only be much more powerful than Madara and Hashirama, but they should also be just as good if not better *shinobi* as well. After all, they did all that in the War when they were only fucking 16 years old, practically children. They've had 2 decades to improve their skills. So why in the **FUCK** does only Sasuke even show a higher level of ability than he did in the fucking War 20 years ago??? Has Naruto even used his Truth Seeking Orbs since then? Dude STILL only knows Rasengan/Rasenshuriken, Shadow Clone, and Summoning Jutsu even as an adult??? That shit's downright embarrassing, let alone for him to be a Hokage. And somehow his SOSP mode looks as though it's weaker than it was before too, if that's even possible. His senses, in combination with Kurama's, should be extremely fine tuned, to where he almost never gets blindsided by anything. That goes doubly for Sasuke who should've been able to dodge Borushiki from the millisecond his foot left the ground. It drives me nuts the level of fights and ability we could've seen from these two but was swept under the rug/tossed right out the window just so that Boruto could have his show and he and his generation could definitely go on to surpass the previous generation.\n\nFuck that.\n\nIt's already established that Naruto and Sasuke are supposed to be the saviours of humanity. Hell, they were predestined from birth to be the greatest. And by all means, they had every possibility to become that, and an insurmountable wall for every shinobi born before the next Ashura and Indra reincarnations (if Kishi really wanted to make a sequel series to Naruto why not focus it on them?). But in this state, I honestly doubt Naruto could beat SOSP Chakra Hashi even if he is stronger by now b/c Hashi'd have much better Jutsu and general skill as well as battle intelligence, or that Sasuke could beat SOSP Chakra + Wood Style Madara. Juubidara or Juubito are entirely out of the question, they'd destroy Naruto or Sasuke 1v1. And that really shouldn't be the case.\n\nSorry for the rant, this just riles me up tbh.",

                            "body": "Honestly not really. At least we've seen him use some of the more fundamental paths of the Rinnegan like Planetary Devastation. Naruto has Hashi cells implanted in his body and literally doesn't bother learning or using Wood Style. He has Truth Seeker orbs and thus has access to literally any Nature Release we've ever seen in the entire series and doesn't use any of them. That includes the Kekkei Genkai and Kekkei Tota ones like Dust, Boil, Storm, Lava, etc, but even without using him he has directly used several through the ones he got from the other Bijuus' Chakra. \n\nSasuke improved his skill as a shinobi during his time with Orochimaru, and between the timeskip and the end of Shippuden. However Naruto spent much of that time, including the timeskip, creating Rasenshuriken, learning Sage Mode/how to use nature energy, and becoming one with Kurama. So he didn't necessarily have as much of a chance to learn more Jutsus and master more Nature Releases and stuff. But in the time since the end of Shippuden he definitely should've. Becoming as strong as possible is extremely important as Hokage, so he can deal with any number of unpredictable situations. To only ever really have mastered Wind Release is ridiculous. \n\nAnd think of the possibilities too, since the Truthseeker Orbs take the necessity of 'affinity' out of the equation. So he could theoretically create a Change of Form Rasengan for other Nature Releases than just Wind (Rasenshuriken). But with all these possibilities in hand the writers either got overwhelmed or didn't care to make Naruto competent, and thus we have this devolved bum who now is gonna probably be useless for the rest of the series.",

Like he was spamming mountain sized meteors without a problem. And the abilities we've seen he had before that were amazing, but we never seen him at full power, like what he could do with the third eye.\n\nSo yah if he wasn't betrayed by Zetsu, Naruto and Sasuke would most likely have lost since even before all the powerups they got easily beaten by Madara, his taijutsu was far better than them.\n\nPeople and mostly Boruto fans like to say that Momoshiki and Ishiki are stronger than Madara, but the feats Madara shown are planetary, while Isshiki and Momoshiki never shown any of this feats.\n\nKishimoto haxed Madara too much and thinking about it there was no way for Naruto and Sasuke to beat him up. Like from the start they tried to seal him cause the damage they were inflicting to him was healed immediately.\n\nSo Black Zetsu betraying him was a good idea, but it was poorly executed.",

Byakugan in the hyugas can only do so much while Otusukis Byakugan have multiple abilities not to mention the tensigan which is basically the upgraded Byakugan which no human can obtain ,and rinnegan have basic abilities unless you truly master your rinnegan and even then, Otosuski rinnegan still to an extent.can overpower any human who has obtained the rinnegan. \nI agree it was bad writing and execution for Black Zetsu Betraying Madara though that shit was wack -.-\nHowever I still kinda think Naruto and Sasuke could have taken Madara. It just would have been harder because he had waaay more battle experience then Kaguya.",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo. Unless you think Naruto >> Hagoromo which is silly considering prime Hagoromo has the 10 tails and rinnegan\n\n>who we know is stronger than Juudara\n\nDepends, 10 Tails Hagoromo >>Juudara >> Base Hagoromo",

The only thing they lost was the Seal specifically for Kaguya.\n\nI\u2019ll point out that, as per the Light Novels, which are canon, not only is Naruto considered a Pseudo-Juubi Jinchuuriki due to retaining the chakra of all 9+Six Paths Senjutsu, 18 year old Naruto with no chakra in base form while sick and having seizures displays light speed feats like dodging photons.\n\nJuudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nFurther, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nBy Yin Sasuke, I meant VOTE2 Sasuke, who was channeling 8.5 Bijuu. Keep up buddy, and learn to stop being stuck in Shippuden.\n\nAlso, that\u2019s not a Databook entry. That\u2019s his movie character profile. You know, the same movie where his counterpart one shots someone with Moon level attacks, which even Madara couldn\u2019t do, putting Toneri as minimum Juudara+, while Naruto wasn\u2019t even in his strongest form?\n\nHell, name a single Juudara feat that matches anything that happens during Naruto vs Toneri, when Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats, which puts him at Hamura\u2019s level easily.",

The only thing they lost was the Seal specifically for Kaguya.\n\nStill has half of his powers\n\n>I\u2019ll point out that, as per the Light Novels, which are canon, not only is Naruto considered a Pseudo-Juubi Jinchuuriki due to retaining the chakra of all 9+Six Paths Senjutsu, 18 year old Naruto with no chakra in base form while sick and having seizures displays light speed feats like dodging photons.\n\nThe novels aren't canon because they're not part of the manga and weren't referenced in the manga. Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

Kishi clearly didn't have a goal in mind with Madara (other than to lose eventually), and it sucks that everything became ridiculous by the end. The Kaguya reveal should've happened way earlier to make it less of a ripoff. Or have Naruto/Sasuke starting to win the fight, and then Zetsu could slip in and take over due to the weakened Madara.\n\nObviously it's easier for us to rewrite scenes when we don't have deadlines to fulfill, but it sucks that the flip from Madara to Kaguya was so janky. Almost like it was a second thought by Kishi to make the sequel have even higher stakes by introducing aliens. The war arc basically broke any believable earthly force being able to compete with Madara, Obito, Sasuke, Naruto, etc. Having the power scaling drop could've made Boruto way more interesting and believable that he could surpass Naruto, without crippling Naruto and Sasuke's abilities. Baryon was amazing to watch/read, but the fight itself wasn't planet level destruction, just basic Tai jutsu, basically, which is easy to translate to every ninja.",

Boruto right now gets stomped easily by any jonin, but Momoshiki is who brings the power level up. \n\nYou must've read/watched a different Naruto, or you're being biased, because fights were paced pretty similarly, which the same level of strategy. You don't have to like Boruto, but the writing has stayed pretty consistent, even if the plot gets weird. \n\nAlso, Naruto and Sasuke were taking on the Akatsuki and winning. They were powered up throughout the series, and surpassed the previous generation pretty early, other than people like Kakashi and Guy, which were surpassed at the end like you said.",

I guess we need to give it another near half decade for it to upgrade from trash to barely tolerable as an anime. \n\nBut then they tell you to read the manga where you got Ikemoto's creep ass drawing Sumire and Sarada like 12 year old hookers as if it's any better. The same power scaling and nerf/character assassination issues exist, just more condensed because the manga literally only has 43 chapters so far whereas the anime is like 90% filler just to keep it airing weekly.\n\nSo yeah they're right, the manga is technically better than the anime because while they are both piles of shit, the manga is a much smaller pile",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent. Its so badly written like what kind of ability is that to take away your opponent life points like in a game.\n\nIt doesn't even last long, and is the worst excuse of a form to take out Kurama.",

Not only does it not hold a candle to how powerful 8th gate Gai was, but it's like a drop in the ocean compared to what Naruto showed off against Toneri in The Last.\n\nI'm actually almost impressed they tried to give him a purely DBZ style powerup that literally doesn't involve anything other than punching harder/moving faster with 0 jutsu involved and still managed to make it both lame and weak compared to what we've seen prior.",

Baryon mode Naruto can barely put a fist sized dent in the ground. The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I was giving reasoning as to why people say Naruto is nerfed. I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

They easily beat Momo. Boruto, injured Sasuke, Jiraya and Kid Naruto beat Urashiki. Sasuke held his own against Kinshiki. \n\nI guess the reason why Jigen was so strong is because he absorbed some of the 10 tails chakra, which makes sense. \n\nBut Sasuke and Naruto handled Juubito, So6P Madara and Kaguya, who were all the 10 Tails Jinchuriki. \n\nThe power scaling is askew.",

The side characters are treated like shit whereas in Naruto side characters were really well treated(way better in OG than Shippuden). Boruto as a MC isnt exciting which is another huge issue. So yeah it has some positives but the negatives outweigh the positives by a big margin. My favorite part of Boruto so far has been the relation between Naruto and Kawaki. It has been really beautifully written and their conversations have been really heart-warming and emotional.",

I think some of the ideas set up at the beginning of Boruto were good like a shift to scientific technology over ninjutsu and how peace is killing off the shinobi lifestyle (which sounds a lot like Kishimoto's vision of a Naruto sequel and is where he seems to be going with Boruto currently) but that was ignored in favor of the Otsutsuki who are like a much more boring version of Saiyans.\n\nAlso even in Shippuden although a lot of side characters were ignored but it never felt like they were mistreated. Like I wish they contributed more but it never felt like Kishimoto ruined their characters.",

He knows Kawaki has trauma and responds to threats, because Isshiki has been conditioning himself that way for years. To him, he wouldn't think Kawaki got over this condition in a matter of moments.

It sure has its problems. However, even if he had chakra left over, he wouldn't be constantly sensing his surroundings. Otsutsukis can suppress their chakra, meaning they can't be sensed, even by people with chakra, so it doesn't matter if he had chakra or not. He had been stabbed dozens and dozens of times and strangled. The fight was over. You're comparing Madara with senjutsu with a beat-up post-fight Sasuke. I mean yeah, plot was a big part of it, sure.

Like Sasuke's actions were completely justified too... He knew he could turn into Borushiki, but why in the hell would he suspect Boruto of suddenly turning into Borushiki? It's not reasonable to be on your guard at all times. No one does that. I don't understand where you're coming up with these exaggerations. He had no time to teleport at all. He was staring at Naruto, not Boruto. That was an error in animation at least. He was staring at Naruto, asking him what Baryon was when he turned to hear the sound coming at him and as soon as he turned, he was stabbed in the eye. He didn't even have time to see Borushiki coming at him. What do you mean? It's not reasonable for Sasuke to do all these things and on his guard, ready to fight Boruto, when honestly he had just been stabbed 20 times, strangled, and was exhausted out of his mind. No one in their right mind would be ready for another fight out of left field when they were on the brink of death. That makes no sense. It would be way too Gary Sue-ish if Sasuke suddenly sensed and reacted to everything 0.5 seconds before they happened to him. He had no time at all.\n\nAll I'm saying is that it's not fair to compare Sage of Six Paths Senjutsu Reborn Madara with an exhausted stabbed-20x strangled and beaten Sasuke. It's not a very fair comparison is all. Also, Sasuke didn't have his eyes active, so he couldn't have time to activate them and then teleport around.",

He could sense the attack coming with Senjutsu, not his eyes.\n2. At this point, Sasuke had been beaten to almost death and quite literally almost died like 3 times. He had no chakra and was completely fatigued. Neither Naruto, nor Sasuke, could barely move.\n3. Borushiki had no chakra that could be sensed by others, so he'd be hard to track down, especially if it was from behind in a complete curveball twist that Sasuke couldn't have predicted or expected. Madara, on the other hand, had his defenses up, while Sasuke had none of his defenses up.",

But if we go off canon information, its still bullshit, since gajeel juvia and the other 2 wizards part of their group were considered the 4 strongest mages outside of fairytails s class and the 10 wizard saints. Gajeel, by the end of fairytail, can still be called one of the best mages, but right when he was reintroduced in the story, he felt nerfed as hell when fighting anyone not named natsu",

Naruto has Hashi cells implanted in his body and literally doesn't bother learning or using Wood Style. He has Truth Seeker orbs and thus has access to literally any Nature Release we've ever seen in the entire series and doesn't use any of them. That includes the Kekkei Genkai and Kekkei Tota ones like Dust, Boil, Storm, Lava, etc, but even without using him he has directly used several through the ones he got from the other Bijuus' Chakra. \n\nSasuke improved his skill as a shinobi during his time with Orochimaru, and between the timeskip and the end of Shippuden. However Naruto spent much of that time, including the timeskip, creating Rasenshuriken, learning Sage Mode/how to use nature energy, and becoming one with Kurama. So he didn't necessarily have as much of a chance to learn more Jutsus and master more Nature Releases and stuff. But in the time since the end of Shippuden he definitely should've. Becoming as strong as possible is extremely important as Hokage, so he can deal with any number of unpredictable situations. To only ever really have mastered Wind Release is ridiculous. \n\nAnd think of the possibilities too, since the Truthseeker Orbs take the necessity of 'affinity' out of the equation. So he could theoretically create a Change of Form Rasengan for other Nature Releases than just Wind (Rasenshuriken). But with all these possibilities in hand the writers either got overwhelmed or didn't care to make Naruto competent, and thus we have this devolved bum who now is gonna probably be useless for the rest of the series.",

And the abilities we've seen he had before that were amazing, but we never seen him at full power, like what he could do with the third eye.\n\nSo yah if he wasn't betrayed by Zetsu, Naruto and Sasuke would most likely have lost since even before all the powerups they got easily beaten by Madara, his taijutsu was far better than them.\n\nPeople and mostly Boruto fans like to say that Momoshiki and Ishiki are stronger than Madara, but the feats Madara shown are planetary, while Isshiki and Momoshiki never shown any of this feats.\n\nKishimoto haxed Madara too much and thinking about it there was no way for Naruto and Sasuke to beat him up. Like from the start they tried to seal him cause the damage they were inflicting to him was healed immediately.\n\nSo Black Zetsu betraying him was a good idea, but it was poorly executed.",

Remember all dojutsu in Naruto  is just a mix of human and Otosuski DNA and chakra so I mean it's not like they don't understand or know about any techniques or abilities   with humans who basically are mutts of their power.sharingan is not an Otosuski thing it's just a mutt version of the  rinne Sharingan. Byakugan in the hyugas can only do so much while Otusukis Byakugan have multiple abilities not to mention the tensigan which is basically the upgraded Byakugan which no human can obtain ,and rinnegan have basic abilities unless you truly master your rinnegan and even then, Otosuski rinnegan still to an extent.can overpower any human who has obtained the rinnegan. \nI agree it was bad writing and execution for Black Zetsu Betraying Madara though that shit was wack -.-\nHowever I still kinda think Naruto and Sasuke could have taken Madara. It just would have been harder because he had waaay more battle experience then Kaguya.",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

In fact, after Momoshiki pulled up sasuke was literally smirking cause he knew he wasn't shit\n\nAlso it's funny cause Momoshiki & Kinshiki got bodied by the 4 Kages and Base Naruto & Sasuke, who are weaker than the previous 5 Kages that Madara clapped \n\n>Kaguya explicitly took him off guard and couldn\u2019t even kill him in doing so. \n\nThe fact that he couldn't even react to her Is what everyone ignores, that's an impressive ass feat + he actually was gonna die if Jigen wasn't nearby: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff19f08b67cfd6d64434278af742ec99\n\n>Juudara would get completely stomped by either Naruto or Sasuke low dif.\n\nSasuke doesn't even have SPSM so how tf can he even touch him? Sasuke can't even heal limbs meanwhile Madara got his body cut in half like it was nothing\n\nNaruto hasn't gotten anything major other than a full nine tails, Juudara has the 10 tails which is far more stronger than all the tailed beast together\n\n>Sasuke is canonically stronger than Kaguya by the time of the Last\n\nThat's headcannon, Kaguya is immortal and can only be sealed with the Sun & Moon seal which BTW requires two ppl.  \n\nSasuke doesn't even have the seal anymore so please tell me how would he be able to take her down? He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo. Unless you think Naruto >> Hagoromo which is silly considering prime Hagoromo has the 10 tails and rinnegan\n\n>who we know is stronger than Juudara\n\nDepends, 10 Tails Hagoromo >>Juudara >> Base Hagoromo",

He can create things out of nothing, he has a susanoo stronger than the ten tails, he is the ten tails jinchuriki, he has control over time, space, matter, he has the strongest rinnegan and all of its abilities, he has all 5 nature releases, sage chakra six paths senjutsu and truth seeking balls.\n\nThe powers that naruto and sasuke received were from a weak old and rusty hagoromo, if anything Hagoromo can just take Sasuke's powers away and leave him to dust. \n\nNot to mention, he was able to take on the 10 tails, I really wanna see Sasuke take one out himself (he can't)",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

Kishi clearly didn't have a goal in mind with Madara (other than to lose eventually), and it sucks that everything became ridiculous by the end. The Kaguya reveal should've happened way earlier to make it less of a ripoff. Or have Naruto/Sasuke starting to win the fight, and then Zetsu could slip in and take over due to the weakened Madara.\n\nObviously it's easier for us to rewrite scenes when we don't have deadlines to fulfill, but it sucks that the flip from Madara to Kaguya was so janky. Almost like it was a second thought by Kishi to make the sequel have even higher stakes by introducing aliens. The war arc basically broke any believable earthly force being able to compete with Madara, Obito, Sasuke, Naruto, etc. Having the power scaling drop could've made Boruto way more interesting and believable that he could surpass Naruto, without crippling Naruto and Sasuke's abilities. Baryon was amazing to watch/read, but the fight itself wasn't planet level destruction, just basic Tai jutsu, basically, which is easy to translate to every ninja.",

Boruto right now gets stomped easily by any jonin, but Momoshiki is who brings the power level up. \n\nYou must've read/watched a different Naruto, or you're being biased, because fights were paced pretty similarly, which the same level of strategy. You don't have to like Boruto, but the writing has stayed pretty consistent, even if the plot gets weird. \n\nAlso, Naruto and Sasuke were taking on the Akatsuki and winning.

I guess we need to give it another near half decade for it to upgrade from trash to barely tolerable as an anime. \n\nBut then they tell you to read the manga where you got Ikemoto's creep ass drawing Sumire and Sarada like 12 year old hookers as if it's any better. The same power scaling and nerf/character assassination issues exist, just more condensed because the manga literally only has 43 chapters so far whereas the anime is like 90% filler just to keep it airing weekly.\n\nSo yeah they're right, the manga is technically better than the anime because while they are both piles of shit, the manga is a much smaller pile",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent. Its so badly written like what kind of ability is that to take away your opponent life points like in a game.\n\nIt doesn't even last long, and is the worst excuse of a form to take out Kurama.",

Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime.

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

They easily beat Momo. Boruto, injured Sasuke, Jiraya and Kid Naruto beat Urashiki. Sasuke held his own against Kinshiki. \n\nI guess the reason why Jigen was so strong is because he absorbed some of the 10 tails chakra, which makes sense. \n\nBut Sasuke and Naruto handled Juubito, So6P Madara and Kaguya, who were all the 10 Tails Jinchuriki. \n\nThe power scaling is askew.",

It\u2019s really easy to scale\n\nThe only difference between Sasuke and Madara\u2019s Rinnegan is that Sasuke can teleport with his. That\u2019s it. And Madara has two not one \n\nAlso Madara ad the 10 Tails would have near unlimited chakra and power output. He can literally make it rain meteors. Sasuke can\u2019t and he\u2019s doesn\u2019t have anywhere near that amount of chakra",

Sasuke literally mentioned how he has gotten stronger as his control over the rinnegan has gotten better, and that was in his fight with Naruto a single day after he got his new abilities, yet you think it\u2019s weird to assume that he got stronger after 15 or so years.                                               His control of his rinnigan had gotten way better as an adult, where he can open portals casually, and he can fight on par with Naruto against Momoshiki, who also is a lot stronger than he was in the war arc. Contrary to what it would seem, opening such a portal takes massive amounts of chakra, yet he could still keep up with Momoshiki in his fused form after using a portal for multiple people.        \n\nNo offense but your opinion is useless if you think he got weaker after 15 years of training and honing his abilities",

Can't say the same for Boruto. Even the characters I like aren't as great as they used to be.",

But yeah the negatives are way too many. The villains are super bland and boring(both in terms of abilities and in terms of personality). Naruto and Sasuke were never allowed to fight at their full potential and now they are nerfed. The side characters are treated like shit whereas in Naruto side characters were really well treated(way better in OG than Shippuden). Boruto as a MC isnt exciting which is another huge issue. So yeah it has some positives but the negatives outweigh the positives by a big margin. My favorite part of Boruto so far has been the relation between Naruto and Kawaki. It has been really beautifully written and their conversations have been really heart-warming and emotional.",

I think some of the ideas set up at the beginning of Boruto were good like a shift to scientific technology over ninjutsu and how peace is killing off the shinobi lifestyle (which sounds a lot like Kishimoto's vision of a Naruto sequel and is where he seems to be going with Boruto currently) but that was ignored in favor of the Otsutsuki who are like a much more boring version of Saiyans.\n\nAlso even in Shippuden although a lot of side characters were ignored but it never felt like they were mistreated.

That's how Madara dodged that.\n\nAlso, Borushiki can suppress his chakra, the little that he had, so it would be almost impossible to sense him. Tobirama can't do that. Sasuke, at this point, had almost died and had no chakra. The battle was over, so his defenses were naturally down. It only makes sense he wouldn't be keeping his defenses up and getting ready for another attack from the rear. Why would he do that? Battle's over. Why would he suspect Boruto of attacking him from the rear while suppressing his chakra. It makes sense in context.",

I'm not denying that, but it was also set up properly in context. Even if he still had chakra to use Amaterasu once after, it wasn't enough to keep his guard up and keep sensing around him.\n\nYou can hate the show all you want, and that's fine. It sure has its problems. However, even if he had chakra left over, he wouldn't be constantly sensing his surroundings. Otsutsukis can suppress their chakra, meaning they can't be sensed, even by people with chakra, so it doesn't matter if he had chakra or not. He had been stabbed dozens and dozens of times and strangled. The fight was over. You're comparing Madara with senjutsu with a beat-up post-fight Sasuke. I mean yeah, plot was a big part of it, sure. I'm not arguing that, but it made sense in context too. They're not excuses. It's natural context needed to understand the situation.",

Like Sasuke's actions were completely justified too... He knew he could turn into Borushiki, but why in the hell would he suspect Boruto of suddenly turning into Borushiki? It's not reasonable to be on your guard at all times. No one does that. I don't understand where you're coming up with these exaggerations. He had no time to teleport at all. He was staring at Naruto, not Boruto. That was an error in animation at least. He was staring at Naruto, asking him what Baryon was when he turned to hear the sound coming at him and as soon as he turned, he was stabbed in the eye. He didn't even have time to see Borushiki coming at him. What do you mean? It's not reasonable for Sasuke to do all these things and on his guard, ready to fight Boruto, when honestly he had just been stabbed 20 times, strangled, and was exhausted out of his mind. No one in their right mind would be ready for another fight out of left field when they were on the brink of death. That makes no sense. It would be way too Gary Sue-ish if Sasuke suddenly sensed and reacted to everything 0.5 seconds before they happened to him. He had no time at all.\n\nAll I'm saying is that it's not fair to compare Sage of Six Paths Senjutsu Reborn Madara with an exhausted stabbed-20x strangled and beaten Sasuke. It's not a very fair comparison is all. Also, Sasuke didn't have his eyes active, so he couldn't have time to activate them and then teleport around.",

Anyways during the scene where he got stabbed he had his tomo\u00e9 on his ringan so he was able to teleport. Also borushiki isn\u2019t a god. It\u2019s an otsutsuki stuck in a TEENAGERS body! If you had told me it was momoshiki with his own body that had stabbed sasuke that might have been more believable but he was still stuck in his teen body so not believable at all. Sure he got a speed boost but he wasn\u2019t nearly as fast as some opponents sasuke has faced.",

Naruto has Hashi cells implanted in his body and literally doesn't bother learning or using Wood Style. He has Truth Seeker orbs and thus has access to literally any Nature Release we've ever seen in the entire series and doesn't use any of them. That includes the Kekkei Genkai and Kekkei Tota ones like Dust, Boil, Storm, Lava, etc, but even without using him he has directly used several through the ones he got from the other Bijuus' Chakra. \n\nSasuke improved his skill as a shinobi during his time with Orochimaru, and between the timeskip and the end of Shippuden. However Naruto spent much of that time, including the timeskip, creating Rasenshuriken, learning Sage Mode/how to use nature energy, and becoming one with Kurama. So he didn't necessarily have as much of a chance to learn more Jutsus and master more Nature Releases and stuff. But in the time since the end of Shippuden he definitely should've. Becoming as strong as possible is extremely important as Hokage, so he can deal with any number of unpredictable situations. To only ever really have mastered Wind Release is ridiculous. \n\nAnd think of the possibilities too, since the Truthseeker Orbs take the necessity of 'affinity' out of the equation. So he could theoretically create a Change of Form Rasengan for other Nature Releases than just Wind (Rasenshuriken). But with all these possibilities in hand the writers either got overwhelmed or didn't care to make Naruto competent, and thus we have this devolved bum who now is gonna probably be useless for the rest of the series.",

Like he was spamming mountain sized meteors without a problem. And the abilities we've seen he had before that were amazing, but we never seen him at full power, like what he could do with the third eye.\n\nSo yah if he wasn't betrayed by Zetsu, Naruto and Sasuke would most likely have lost since even before all the powerups they got easily beaten by Madara, his taijutsu was far better than them.\n\nPeople and mostly Boruto fans like to say that Momoshiki and Ishiki are stronger than Madara, but the feats Madara shown are planetary, while Isshiki and Momoshiki never shown any of this feats.\n\nKishimoto haxed Madara too much and thinking about it there was no way for Naruto and Sasuke to beat him up. Like from the start they tried to seal him cause the damage they were inflicting to him was healed immediately.\n\nSo Black Zetsu betraying him was a good idea, but it was poorly executed.",

Remember all dojutsu in Naruto  is just a mix of human and Otosuski DNA and chakra so I mean it's not like they don't understand or know about any techniques or abilities   with humans who basically are mutts of their power.sharingan is not an Otosuski thing it's just a mutt version of the  rinne Sharingan. Byakugan in the hyugas can only do so much while Otusukis Byakugan have multiple abilities not to mention the tensigan which is basically the upgraded Byakugan which no human can obtain ,and rinnegan have basic abilities unless you truly master your rinnegan and even then, Otosuski rinnegan still to an extent.can overpower any human who has obtained the rinnegan. \nI agree it was bad writing and execution for Black Zetsu Betraying Madara though that shit was wack -.-\nHowever I still kinda think Naruto and Sasuke could have taken Madara. It just would have been harder because he had waaay more battle experience then Kaguya.",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

In fact, after Momoshiki pulled up sasuke was literally smirking cause he knew he wasn't shit\n\nAlso it's funny cause Momoshiki & Kinshiki got bodied by the 4 Kages and Base Naruto & Sasuke, who are weaker than the previous 5 Kages that Madara clapped \n\n>Kaguya explicitly took him off guard and couldn\u2019t even kill him in doing so. \n\nThe fact that he couldn't even react to her Is what everyone ignores, that's an impressive ass feat + he actually was gonna die if Jigen wasn't nearby: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff19f08b67cfd6d64434278af742ec99\n\n>Juudara would get completely stomped by either Naruto or Sasuke low dif.\n\nSasuke doesn't even have SPSM so how tf can he even touch him?

He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo. Unless you think Naruto >> Hagoromo which is silly considering prime Hagoromo has the 10 tails and rinnegan\n\n>who we know is stronger than Juudara\n\nDepends, 10 Tails Hagoromo >>Juudara >> Base Hagoromo",

He can create things out of nothing, he has a susanoo stronger than the ten tails, he is the ten tails jinchuriki, he has control over time, space, matter, he has the strongest rinnegan and all of its abilities, he has all 5 nature releases, sage chakra six paths senjutsu and truth seeking balls.\n\nThe powers that naruto and sasuke received were from a weak old and rusty hagoromo, if anything Hagoromo can just take Sasuke's powers away and leave him to dust. \n\nNot to mention, he was able to take on the 10 tails, I really wanna see Sasuke take one out himself (he can't)",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

Kishi clearly didn't have a goal in mind with Madara (other than to lose eventually), and it sucks that everything became ridiculous by the end. The Kaguya reveal should've happened way earlier to make it less of a ripoff. Or have Naruto/Sasuke starting to win the fight, and then Zetsu could slip in and take over due to the weakened Madara.\n\nObviously it's easier for us to rewrite scenes when we don't have deadlines to fulfill, but it sucks that the flip from Madara to Kaguya was so janky. Almost like it was a second thought by Kishi to make the sequel have even higher stakes by introducing aliens. The war arc basically broke any believable earthly force being able to compete with Madara, Obito, Sasuke, Naruto, etc. Having the power scaling drop could've made Boruto way more interesting and believable that he could surpass Naruto, without crippling Naruto and Sasuke's abilities. Baryon was amazing to watch/read, but the fight itself wasn't planet level destruction, just basic Tai jutsu, basically, which is easy to translate to every ninja.",

You don't have to like Boruto, but the writing has stayed pretty consistent, even if the plot gets weird. \n\nAlso, Naruto and Sasuke were taking on the Akatsuki and winning. They were powered up throughout the series, and surpassed the previous generation pretty early, other than people like Kakashi and Guy, which were surpassed at the end like you said.",

I guess we need to give it another near half decade for it to upgrade from trash to barely tolerable as an anime. \n\nBut then they tell you to read the manga where you got Ikemoto's creep ass drawing Sumire and Sarada like 12 year old hookers as if it's any better. The same power scaling and nerf/character assassination issues exist, just more condensed because the manga literally only has 43 chapters so far whereas the anime is like 90% filler just to keep it airing weekly.\n\nSo yeah they're right, the manga is technically better than the anime because while they are both piles of shit, the manga is a much smaller pile",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode Naruto can barely put a fist sized dent in the ground. The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

It might actually be closer to the stone then the lightning thinking about it now",

Sasuke literally mentioned how he has gotten stronger as his control over the rinnegan has gotten better, and that was in his fight with Naruto a single day after he got his new abilities, yet you think it\u2019s weird to assume that he got stronger after 15 or so years.                                               His control of his rinnigan had gotten way better as an adult, where he can open portals casually, and he can fight on par with Naruto against Momoshiki, who also is a lot stronger than he was in the war arc. Contrary to what it would seem, opening such a portal takes massive amounts of chakra, yet he could still keep up with Momoshiki in his fused form after using a portal for multiple people.        \n\nNo offense but your opinion is useless if you think he got weaker after 15 years of training and honing his abilities",

But yeah the negatives are way too many. The villains are super bland and boring(both in terms of abilities and in terms of personality). Naruto and Sasuke were never allowed to fight at their full potential and now they are nerfed. The side characters are treated like shit whereas in Naruto side characters were really well treated(way better in OG than Shippuden). Boruto as a MC isnt exciting which is another huge issue. So yeah it has some positives but the negatives outweigh the positives by a big margin. My favorite part of Boruto so far has been the relation between Naruto and Kawaki. It has been really beautifully written and their conversations have been really heart-warming and emotional.",

I think some of the ideas set up at the beginning of Boruto were good like a shift to scientific technology over ninjutsu and how peace is killing off the shinobi lifestyle (which sounds a lot like Kishimoto's vision of a Naruto sequel and is where he seems to be going with Boruto currently) but that was ignored in favor of the Otsutsuki who are like a much more boring version of Saiyans.\n\nAlso even in Shippuden although a lot of side characters were ignored but it never felt like they were mistreated.

Like Sasuke's actions were completely justified too... He knew he could turn into Borushiki, but why in the hell would he suspect Boruto of suddenly turning into Borushiki? It's not reasonable to be on your guard at all times. No one does that. I don't understand where you're coming up with these exaggerations. He had no time to teleport at all. He was staring at Naruto, not Boruto. That was an error in animation at least. He was staring at Naruto, asking him what Baryon was when he turned to hear the sound coming at him and as soon as he turned, he was stabbed in the eye. He didn't even have time to see Borushiki coming at him. What do you mean? It's not reasonable for Sasuke to do all these things and on his guard, ready to fight Boruto, when honestly he had just been stabbed 20 times, strangled, and was exhausted out of his mind. No one in their right mind would be ready for another fight out of left field when they were on the brink of death. That makes no sense. It would be way too Gary Sue-ish if Sasuke suddenly sensed and reacted to everything 0.5 seconds before they happened to him. He had no time at all.\n\nAll I'm saying is that it's not fair to compare Sage of Six Paths Senjutsu Reborn Madara with an exhausted stabbed-20x strangled and beaten Sasuke. It's not a very fair comparison is all. Also, Sasuke didn't have his eyes active, so he couldn't have time to activate them and then teleport around.",

Like he was spamming mountain sized meteors without a problem. And the abilities we've seen he had before that were amazing, but we never seen him at full power, like what he could do with the third eye.\n\nSo yah if he wasn't betrayed by Zetsu, Naruto and Sasuke would most likely have lost since even before all the powerups they got easily beaten by Madara, his taijutsu was far better than them.\n\nPeople and mostly Boruto fans like to say that Momoshiki and Ishiki are stronger than Madara, but the feats Madara shown are planetary, while Isshiki and Momoshiki never shown any of this feats.\n\nKishimoto haxed Madara too much and thinking about it there was no way for Naruto and Sasuke to beat him up. Like from the start they tried to seal him cause the damage they were inflicting to him was healed immediately.\n\nSo Black Zetsu betraying him was a good idea, but it was poorly executed.",

Remember all dojutsu in Naruto  is just a mix of human and Otosuski DNA and chakra so I mean it's not like they don't understand or know about any techniques or abilities   with humans who basically are mutts of their power.sharingan is not an Otosuski thing it's just a mutt version of the  rinne Sharingan. Byakugan in the hyugas can only do so much while Otusukis Byakugan have multiple abilities not to mention the tensigan which is basically the upgraded Byakugan which no human can obtain ,and rinnegan have basic abilities unless you truly master your rinnegan and even then, Otosuski rinnegan still to an extent.can overpower any human who has obtained the rinnegan. \nI agree it was bad writing and execution for Black Zetsu Betraying Madara though that shit was wack -.-\nHowever I still kinda think Naruto and Sasuke could have taken Madara. It just would have been harder because he had waaay more battle experience then Kaguya.",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

In fact, after Momoshiki pulled up sasuke was literally smirking cause he knew he wasn't shit\n\nAlso it's funny cause Momoshiki & Kinshiki got bodied by the 4 Kages and Base Naruto & Sasuke, who are weaker than the previous 5 Kages that Madara clapped \n\n>Kaguya explicitly took him off guard and couldn\u2019t even kill him in doing so. \n\nThe fact that he couldn't even react to her Is what everyone ignores, that's an impressive ass feat + he actually was gonna die if Jigen wasn't nearby: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff19f08b67cfd6d64434278af742ec99\n\n>Juudara would get completely stomped by either Naruto or Sasuke low dif.\n\nSasuke doesn't even have SPSM so how tf can he even touch him? Sasuke can't even heal limbs meanwhile Madara got his body cut in half like it was nothing\n\nNaruto hasn't gotten anything major other than a full nine tails, Juudara has the 10 tails which is far more stronger than all the tailed beast together\n\n>Sasuke is canonically stronger than Kaguya by the time of the Last\n\nThat's headcannon, Kaguya is immortal and can only be sealed with the Sun & Moon seal which BTW requires two ppl.  \n\nSasuke doesn't even have the seal anymore so please tell me how would he be able to take her down? He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo. Unless you think Naruto >> Hagoromo which is silly considering prime Hagoromo has the 10 tails and rinnegan\n\n>who we know is stronger than Juudara\n\nDepends, 10 Tails Hagoromo >>Juudara >> Base Hagoromo",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

Kishi clearly didn't have a goal in mind with Madara (other than to lose eventually), and it sucks that everything became ridiculous by the end. The Kaguya reveal should've happened way earlier to make it less of a ripoff. Or have Naruto/Sasuke starting to win the fight, and then Zetsu could slip in and take over due to the weakened Madara.\n\nObviously it's easier for us to rewrite scenes when we don't have deadlines to fulfill, but it sucks that the flip from Madara to Kaguya was so janky. Almost like it was a second thought by Kishi to make the sequel have even higher stakes by introducing aliens. The war arc basically broke any believable earthly force being able to compete with Madara, Obito, Sasuke, Naruto, etc. Having the power scaling drop could've made Boruto way more interesting and believable that he could surpass Naruto, without crippling Naruto and Sasuke's abilities. Baryon was amazing to watch/read, but the fight itself wasn't planet level destruction, just basic Tai jutsu, basically, which is easy to translate to every ninja.",

I guess we need to give it another near half decade for it to upgrade from trash to barely tolerable as an anime. \n\nBut then they tell you to read the manga where you got Ikemoto's creep ass drawing Sumire and Sarada like 12 year old hookers as if it's any better. The same power scaling and nerf/character assassination issues exist, just more condensed because the manga literally only has 43 chapters so far whereas the anime is like 90% filler just to keep it airing weekly.\n\nSo yeah they're right, the manga is technically better than the anime because while they are both piles of shit, the manga is a much smaller pile",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent. Its so badly written like what kind of ability is that to take away your opponent life points like in a game.\n\nIt doesn't even last long, and is the worst excuse of a form to take out Kurama.",

Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime.

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

Sasuke literally mentioned how he has gotten stronger as his control over the rinnegan has gotten better, and that was in his fight with Naruto a single day after he got his new abilities, yet you think it\u2019s weird to assume that he got stronger after 15 or so years.                                               His control of his rinnigan had gotten way better as an adult, where he can open portals casually, and he can fight on par with Naruto against Momoshiki, who also is a lot stronger than he was in the war arc. Contrary to what it would seem, opening such a portal takes massive amounts of chakra, yet he could still keep up with Momoshiki in his fused form after using a portal for multiple people.        \n\nNo offense but your opinion is useless if you think he got weaker after 15 years of training and honing his abilities",

He knew he could turn into Borushiki, but why in the hell would he suspect Boruto of suddenly turning into Borushiki? It's not reasonable to be on your guard at all times. No one does that. I don't understand where you're coming up with these exaggerations. He had no time to teleport at all. He was staring at Naruto, not Boruto. That was an error in animation at least. He was staring at Naruto, asking him what Baryon was when he turned to hear the sound coming at him and as soon as he turned, he was stabbed in the eye. He didn't even have time to see Borushiki coming at him. What do you mean? It's not reasonable for Sasuke to do all these things and on his guard, ready to fight Boruto, when honestly he had just been stabbed 20 times, strangled, and was exhausted out of his mind. No one in their right mind would be ready for another fight out of left field when they were on the brink of death. That makes no sense. It would be way too Gary Sue-ish if Sasuke suddenly sensed and reacted to everything 0.5 seconds before they happened to him. He had no time at all.\n\nAll I'm saying is that it's not fair to compare Sage of Six Paths Senjutsu Reborn Madara with an exhausted stabbed-20x strangled and beaten Sasuke. It's not a very fair comparison is all. Also, Sasuke didn't have his eyes active, so he couldn't have time to activate them and then teleport around.",

Byakugan in the hyugas can only do so much while Otusukis Byakugan have multiple abilities not to mention the tensigan which is basically the upgraded Byakugan which no human can obtain ,and rinnegan have basic abilities unless you truly master your rinnegan and even then, Otosuski rinnegan still to an extent.can overpower any human who has obtained the rinnegan. \nI agree it was bad writing and execution for Black Zetsu Betraying Madara though that shit was wack -.-\nHowever I still kinda think Naruto and Sasuke could have taken Madara. It just would have been harder because he had waaay more battle experience then Kaguya.",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

Kishi clearly didn't have a goal in mind with Madara (other than to lose eventually), and it sucks that everything became ridiculous by the end. The Kaguya reveal should've happened way earlier to make it less of a ripoff. Or have Naruto/Sasuke starting to win the fight, and then Zetsu could slip in and take over due to the weakened Madara.\n\nObviously it's easier for us to rewrite scenes when we don't have deadlines to fulfill, but it sucks that the flip from Madara to Kaguya was so janky. Almost like it was a second thought by Kishi to make the sequel have even higher stakes by introducing aliens. The war arc basically broke any believable earthly force being able to compete with Madara, Obito, Sasuke, Naruto, etc. Having the power scaling drop could've made Boruto way more interesting and believable that he could surpass Naruto, without crippling Naruto and Sasuke's abilities. Baryon was amazing to watch/read, but the fight itself wasn't planet level destruction, just basic Tai jutsu, basically, which is easy to translate to every ninja.",

I guess we need to give it another near half decade for it to upgrade from trash to barely tolerable as an anime. \n\nBut then they tell you to read the manga where you got Ikemoto's creep ass drawing Sumire and Sarada like 12 year old hookers as if it's any better. The same power scaling and nerf/character assassination issues exist, just more condensed because the manga literally only has 43 chapters so far whereas the anime is like 90% filler just to keep it airing weekly.\n\nSo yeah they're right, the manga is technically better than the anime because while they are both piles of shit, the manga is a much smaller pile",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent.

Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime.

The war was somewhere in between the sand and lightning.

And Madara has two not one \n\nAlso Madara ad the 10 Tails would have near unlimited chakra and power output. He can literally make it rain meteors.

Sasuke literally mentioned how he has gotten stronger as his control over the rinnegan has gotten better, and that was in his fight with Naruto a single day after he got his new abilities, yet you think it\u2019s weird to assume that he got stronger after 15 or so years.                                               His control of his rinnigan had gotten way better as an adult, where he can open portals casually, and he can fight on par with Naruto against Momoshiki, who also is a lot stronger than he was in the war arc. Contrary to what it would seem, opening such a portal takes massive amounts of chakra, yet he could still keep up with Momoshiki in his fused form after using a portal for multiple people.        \n\nNo offense but your opinion is useless if you think he got weaker after 15 years of training and honing his abilities",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

In fact, after Momoshiki pulled up sasuke was literally smirking cause he knew he wasn't shit\n\nAlso it's funny cause Momoshiki & Kinshiki got bodied by the 4 Kages and Base Naruto & Sasuke, who are weaker than the previous 5 Kages that Madara clapped \n\n>Kaguya explicitly took him off guard and couldn\u2019t even kill him in doing so. \n\nThe fact that he couldn't even react to her Is what everyone ignores, that's an impressive ass feat + he actually was gonna die if Jigen wasn't nearby: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff19f08b67cfd6d64434278af742ec99\n\n>Juudara would get completely stomped by either Naruto or Sasuke low dif.\n\nSasuke doesn't even have SPSM so how tf can he even touch him?

He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo.

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent. Its so badly written like what kind of ability is that to take away your opponent life points like in a game.\n\nIt doesn't even last long, and is the worst excuse of a form to take out Kurama.",

The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

Aliens that want to harvest the earth, basic writing but tbh expected bcuz, well I didn't expect alot of depth to the story after they killed the best William.\nI agree that I feel like Otosuski life prior to their obsession with earth would be good to the story, and since Kishimoto is writing it, it MIGHT happen. That being said  hopes are not up for this to happen.\n \nTo be fair the the only person to show feats to actually beat Madara is Ishikki. Remember it in reality Sauske and Naruto did train after the 4th war so they aren't nerfed. Shit Sauskes Rinnegan is the strongest in the series because it came straight from hagaromo and not just manifested with indra ashuras chakra. (Also meaning Sauske may be able to attain his rinnegan since he posseses both chakras since He no longer has one)\nBut with Ishikkis Dojutsu he can basically just put Madaras meteors in a pocket dimension and keep them there until he wants to use them,or shrink down to size to possibly avoid it, or tbh he could instill a karma on him\n\n\nBad writing agreed but just based off Ishikkis abilities he can probably take Madara. He outranks every Otosuski and probably has way more battle experience then Madara since he's been alive for 4000 plus years.",

In fact, after Momoshiki pulled up sasuke was literally smirking cause he knew he wasn't shit\n\nAlso it's funny cause Momoshiki & Kinshiki got bodied by the 4 Kages and Base Naruto & Sasuke, who are weaker than the previous 5 Kages that Madara clapped \n\n>Kaguya explicitly took him off guard and couldn\u2019t even kill him in doing so. \n\nThe fact that he couldn't even react to her Is what everyone ignores, that's an impressive ass feat + he actually was gonna die if Jigen wasn't nearby: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff19f08b67cfd6d64434278af742ec99\n\n>Juudara would get completely stomped by either Naruto or Sasuke low dif.\n\nSasuke doesn't even have SPSM so how tf can he even touch him? Sasuke can't even heal limbs meanwhile Madara got his body cut in half like it was nothing\n\nNaruto hasn't gotten anything major other than a full nine tails, Juudara has the 10 tails which is far more stronger than all the tailed beast together\n\n>Sasuke is canonically stronger than Kaguya by the time of the Last\n\nThat's headcannon, Kaguya is immortal and can only be sealed with the Sun & Moon seal which BTW requires two ppl.  \n\nSasuke doesn't even have the seal anymore so please tell me how would he be able to take her down? He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo. Unless you think Naruto >> Hagoromo which is silly considering prime Hagoromo has the 10 tails and rinnegan\n\n>who we know is stronger than Juudara\n\nDepends, 10 Tails Hagoromo >>Juudara >> Base Hagoromo",

Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

I've read fanfiction more engaging and better written than Boruto. \n\nKurama's death in the anime I think was heavily carried by the flashback sequence playing with the music which once again for a rare \"good\" moment in Boruto, only worked because it reminded us of Naruto and Shippuden and appealed directly to that nostalgia. Notice how literally none of the scenes/moments in the ending sequence are from Boruto lol.\n\nHowever even with his improved death scene, I still dislike it to begin with because Shippuden established exactly why Bijuu can't actually die and this Baryon mode nonsense that comes out of nowhere with Kurama magically knowing what nuclear fusion is is just ridiculous. All to beat a guy that the Naruto and Sasuke from 'The Last' movie, which is canon, would body in minutes if even that.",

The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

He couldn't even take down Madara, they tried to seal him because he kept healing everything they threw at him which means their attacks weren't sufficient against his defense, and this is KAGUYA we're talking about.\n\n>Toneri is equal to Hamura, who is a peer to Hagoromo\n\nYou're def smoking something because Toneri would absolutely get smoked by Hamura. Why? Well Naruto has half of Hagoromo power and Hamura is equal to Hagoromo.

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

People keep saying that Isshiki can shrink anything they throw at him, but is not like he has infinite chakra to do all that.\n\nHe has no feats for a powerful Otsutsuki, his only feat is beating a nerfed version of Naruto and Sasuke who didn't even used their brain in all of their fights, except the Momoshiki one where it was the movie that did all the job, the manga sucked there too cause it was shorter there.\n\nI hate this series cause it doesn't use any strategy in their fights. Baryon mode is literally a boxing match. In the manga Kurama was talking about boxing when explaining to Naruto how Baryon mode works. A series about ninjas uses boxing as an example.\n\nKodachi or what his name is, was a trash writer who didn't even read or watched Naruto and the guy who draws the manga is a creep to me for the way he draws Sarada, he also can't draw action scenes or facial expressions.\n\nBaryon mode is the stupidest form I've seen and is also useless against any other opponent. Its so badly written like what kind of ability is that to take away your opponent life points like in a game.\n\nIt doesn't even last long, and is the worst excuse of a form to take out Kurama.",

The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

He can create things out of nothing, he has a susanoo stronger than the ten tails, he is the ten tails jinchuriki, he has control over time, space, matter, he has the strongest rinnegan and all of its abilities, he has all 5 nature releases, sage chakra six paths senjutsu and truth seeking balls.\n\nThe powers that naruto and sasuke received were from a weak old and rusty hagoromo, if anything Hagoromo can just take Sasuke's powers away and leave him to dust. \n\nNot to mention, he was able to take on the 10 tails, I really wanna see Sasuke take one out himself (he can't)",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

The fights In shipuden seem way better and make the characters seem stronger and give them actual feats beyond saying they are facing  someone stronger then someone they fought before. Like that's literally ishikki. He has no feats like we see in Naruto with pain leveling the leaf, madara summoning meteors and Naruto as well as the tailed beast, destroying literally everything in their path. If ishikki had a feat like that, instead of saying he's stronger then kaguya momoshiki (who got bodied by Naruto with half Chakra and Sasuke already drained) and all the other otsosuki, then there wouldn't be a problem and no debate in Naruto being nerfed. I personally don't think hes nerfed, he just feels insanely nerfed. Like Sakura feals stronger then Naruto. If I hadn't had previous knowledge of shipuden, then I would totally say Sakura was stronger then Naruto based off of borutos anime. The animation and art style isn't for an action anime with an established power ranking. It's for a slice of life or brand new Shonen action anime.",

I also explained what I was referring to by feats by giving examples from shipuden. It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",

Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

            "body": ">He did not imbue them with power that can be taken away. The only thing they lost was the Seal specifically for Kaguya.\n\nStill has half of his powers\n\n>I\u2019ll point out that, as per the Light Novels, which are canon, not only is Naruto considered a Pseudo-Juubi Jinchuuriki due to retaining the chakra of all 9+Six Paths Senjutsu, 18 year old Naruto with no chakra in base form while sick and having seizures displays light speed feats like dodging photons.\n\nThe novels aren't canon because they're not part of the manga and weren't referenced in the manga. Nice try but Kishimoto drawing the covers and approving them doesn't make them canon, neither does a novel-only timeline.\n\n>Juudara was struggling to keep up with SPSM Naruto as is, and that Naruto\u2019s best feat is Light Speed, and you expect me to believe he\u2019s even close to being able to lay a finger on SPSM Hokage Naruto? He cannot touch any of the Boruto God-Tiers. Especially since Naruto and Sasuke were cleanly and casually countering every single one of his attacks, and then they got stronger as they figured out their new powers.\n\nJuudara has Sasuke's jutsu versatility. He also has both halves of Hagoromo's power (Rinnegan and Senjutsu) whereas Naruto and Sasuke each only had a half. \n\nYou can argue that adult Sasuke and Naruto have equal \"overall skills\" to Juudara (taijutsu, strength, speed, etc), but Juudara still has the opposite portion of Hagoromo's abilities that Naruto and Sasuke don't have access to, Rinnegan and 6 Paths Sage Mode. Basically, he simply has much more to offer than the two can do individually in the godly-power side of things.\n\nIf we're talking Chakra then Juudara without a doubt wins this cause Naruto has Kurama and portions of the other Bijuu while Juudara has the Juubi which is stated to be more superior to all Bijuu, even Kurama was shocked by it's strength: https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-715320d9d879ae14b03749c644ebf103-cswell \n\nAlso keep in mind that Juudara was fighting both Rinnegan Sasuke and SPSM Naruto simultaneously and Juudara only had one Rinnegan for 99% of the fight (so his Rinnegan was actually weaker than Sasuke's during their fight), sure Naruto and Sasuke gave him trouble, but never actually beat him. They resorted to sealing because all their attacks weren't doing enough damage aswell as gaining immortality \n\nNaruto has senjutsu but Madara has senjutsu and the rinnegan, the rinnegan power aspect is what Naruto lacked and the senjutsu power aspect is what Sasuke lacked which means individually his power is greater than theirs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke did get stronger as they became older but Madara's senjutsu & rinnegan power is still superior. Did I mention he can cast the rinnesharingan?\n\nAdult Sasuke doesn't have Six Paths Senjutsu so what can he even possibly due to hurt him\n\nAdult Naruto can't heal limbs nor does his power come close to the Juubi so how can he come close to someone who has far greater power than him\n\nThe moment somebody absorbs the Juubi like Kaguya, Madara or Obito did the only possible ways of beating them is either sealing them with SO6P sun and moon chibaku tensei or extracting the Juubi/9 bijuus. Naruto alone isn\u2019t able to do either of them. Hell without Sasuke he can\u2019t defend against Infinite Tsukuyomi so how tf can he take him down?\n\nMadara is immortal after absorbing the God Tree so whatever damage Naruto inflicts is regenerated. Naruto can't strip away his bijuu chakra without six paths chibaku tensei which he no longer has anymore and can't perform on his own even if he still had it.\n\n>Further, there\u2019s nothing indicating that the current Kage generation are weaker than the previous. Just the opposite in fact, they are without question the strongest generation of Kage, even if you exclude Naruto.\n\nThe old Kages are definitely stronger. \n\nDo you really think Kurotsuchi and Chojuro are stronger than Ohnoki and Mei?\n\nDarui has no speed or strength feats that are comparable to A.\n\nThe only Kage who is stronger is Gaara, who almost immobilized Fused Momoshiki solo, but did not anticipate his hair justu.\n\n>Toneri demonstrates multiple moon level feats\n\nCutting a hollow moon in half isn't moon level nor did he demonstrate multiple moom level feats",

It's a different show where the characters feel weaker and don't have anything impressive in their resume, so you'd expect the main antagonist, ishikki, to flex his power. Or for the protagonist, or in this case, the ones doing the fighting, to have feats that prove they are stronger. This is the same problem with momoshikki. It's the problem with all boruto antagonist actually. Ishikki is strong, and I personally believe he is stronger then kaguya, but kaguya can be easily compared easily in Naruto, while ishikki can't in boruto",
