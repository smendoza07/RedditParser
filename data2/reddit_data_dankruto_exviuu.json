Normal people didn't have to do that.\n\n>I mean its intense but the hidden villages are a society thats highest value is millitary strength.

They basically follow the old \"if you die you die\" rule and their graduation test shows it. The physically strongest come out on top and the weak die.\n\nHidden leaf was not like that though. It was extremely out of character. Their entire thing seems to be \"protect the king (which refers to the next generation)\" and then they were just sending out kids to their potential death without any worries.\n\nNot to mention that they seems to be really reluctant to send out kids into real life high risk missions. Naruto had to beg to get a low-risk escort mission. But they think that risking your life unnecessarily in the chunin exams is fine.",

Normal people didn't have to do that.\n\n>I mean its intense but the hidden villages are a society thats highest value is millitary strength. And even in reality there have been societies that hold the same values (sparta, monguels, some african tribes during colonialism era).  \n>  \n>Not crazy to understand sytems emplace to prepare and create the best warriors. Systematic and comprensive curriculum is to be expected\n\nTBH it would make sense if this happened in Hidden mist based on their culture. They basically follow the old \"if you die you die\" rule and their graduation test shows it. The physically strongest come out on top and the weak die.\n\nHidden leaf was not like that though. It was extremely out of character. Their entire thing seems to be \"protect the king (which refers to the next generation)\" and then they were just sending out kids to their potential death without any worries.\n\nNot to mention that they seems to be really reluctant to send out kids into real life high risk missions. Naruto had to beg to get a low-risk escort mission. But they think that risking your life unnecessarily in the chunin exams is fine.",
