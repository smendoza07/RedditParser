Amazing hair cut btw keep it until you can\u2019t stand it anymore. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s hard to tell but if your barber gave you a hard part (shaving in your part to make it more defined) don\u2019t do it next time. You have to get it cut every two weeks and it\u2019s somewhat falling out of style. More worth it to just train your hair to part imo ",
