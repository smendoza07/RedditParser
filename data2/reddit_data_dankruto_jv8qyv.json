Naruto didn\u2019t only have access to the nine tails chakra, but was also the son of the fourth Hokage, and the reincarnated grandson of a god. Neji was right, birth dictates aptitude.",

Even when Naruto got buffs from the Nine Tails before he took his power all it did was weaken his physical and mental state in the long run. And that's not even getting into social isolation.\n\nBeing the son of the 4th Hokage did nothing for Naruto along the same lines. By the time that knowledge became public, Naruto was already the hero of the Hidden Leaf on his own merits. Naruto beat Pain with Sage Mode and the Rasengan. Both things he trained for.\n\nAnd Asura's bloodline gave Naruto some power ups which he only unlocked because he came into contact with the SOSP but by that point it was a foregone conclusion that Naruto would become Hokage.\n\nSo at no point is Neji right about birthright making you a Hokage. Tbh the only Hokage who had that position handed to them was Tsunade and she already had proven herself as a Sannin.",

I don\u2019t mean being the child of a kage helps from a nepotism standpoint, it\u2019s the level of skill his family posses. His mother was from a unique clan with special chakra and his dad was a ninja genius. Even before tapping into the nine tails, Naruto had a big reservoir of chakra and I\u2019m guessing he got that from his mom. I\u2019m not saying Naruto did it alone or it was easy, I\u2019m saying his lineage 100% gave him a leg up.",

Even when Naruto got buffs from the Nine Tails before he took his power all it did was weaken his physical and mental state in the long run. And that's not even getting into social isolation.\n\nBeing the son of the 4th Hokage did nothing for Naruto along the same lines. By the time that knowledge became public, Naruto was already the hero of the Hidden Leaf on his own merits. Naruto beat Pain with Sage Mode and the Rasengan. Both things he trained for.\n\nAnd Asura's bloodline gave Naruto some power ups which he only unlocked because he came into contact with the SOSP but by that point it was a foregone conclusion that Naruto would become Hokage.\n\nSo at no point is Neji right about birthright making you a Hokage. Tbh the only Hokage who had that position handed to them was Tsunade and she already had proven herself as a Sannin.",

But yea he would have lost most of his battles without nine tails and during the entire war arc he carried the shinobi forces using nine tails chakra . Rock Lee is just a much better representation of hardwork no doubt.",

Which is exactly what he did. He broke the fated cycle of reincarnation due to his PERSEVERANCE, which is the theme of the show as a whole. \u201cGuts to never give up, ninja way, a shinobi is one who endured, etc.\u201d Naruto\u2019s hard headed-ness and determination is what allowed him to break the cycle.\n\nIf fact, if you wanna get technical, Naruto was destined to not be able to accomplish his main goal of becoming Hokage (in his own words). Naruto said \u201chow can I be Hokage if I can\u2019t save a single friend.\u201d Naruto was destined to not be able to save Sasuke, therefore to also not be able to become Hokage.

And that's not even getting into social isolation.\n\nBeing the son of the 4th Hokage did nothing for Naruto along the same lines. By the time that knowledge became public, Naruto was already the hero of the Hidden Leaf on his own merits. Naruto beat Pain with Sage Mode and the Rasengan. Both things he trained for.\n\nAnd Asura's bloodline gave Naruto some power ups which he only unlocked because he came into contact with the SOSP but by that point it was a foregone conclusion that Naruto would become Hokage.\n\nSo at no point is Neji right about birthright making you a Hokage.

Even when Naruto got buffs from the Nine Tails before he took his power all it did was weaken his physical and mental state in the long run. And that's not even getting into social isolation.\n\nBeing the son of the 4th Hokage did nothing for Naruto along the same lines. By the time that knowledge became public, Naruto was already the hero of the Hidden Leaf on his own merits. Naruto beat Pain with Sage Mode and the Rasengan. Both things he trained for.\n\nAnd Asura's bloodline gave Naruto some power ups which he only unlocked because he came into contact with the SOSP but by that point it was a foregone conclusion that Naruto would become Hokage.\n\nSo at no point is Neji right about birthright making you a Hokage. Tbh the only Hokage who had that position handed to them was Tsunade and she already had proven herself as a Sannin.",
