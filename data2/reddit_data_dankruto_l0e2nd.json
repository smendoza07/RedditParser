Its in the anime.\n\nThe manga does *not* have that. Shes the one who realised sasuke would leave the village while naruto was going \"nahhh\". Not a sasusaku shipper in canon but just saying that was just unnecessary on the anime's part.\n\nAnd the famous \"who will I save? naruto or sasuke?\" Filler. Bruh, how do you expect anime fans to stay unbiased after *that*? Thats fuel to sakura hate.\n\nAnyway, I dont think its the anime actively propagating against sakura lmao. Just that a lot of her character was butchered for time or \"oh..naruto understood not me\" moments. Also the tsundere thing. Maybe the anime thought if they push her to be a tsundere in the fillers narusaku would be more possible since tsunderes were The Thing back then?",

Some criticism with her writing is valid. But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

Madara was the perfect villain and ending the Naruto saga there would've been perfect... Every fan would've been satisfied.\nAnd the other thing I didn't like about Boruto is the hokage inauguration episode...from day 1 episode 1 we have heard Naruto say hokage hokage hokage and then finally the day comes and there it is a fucking god knocked out by his 5-6 year old daughter...and I got salty after that...but once I start I gotta finish it so I watch it nonetheless.",

But even if you do watch for Nardo, all that nigga does is sit in a chair and either spout or listen to exposition in the anime. I do love Naruto in the manga though.

I highly doubt anyone in it just for Naruto watches every single Boruto episode. \n\nAs someone who has seen all of the anime so far, I would be lying if I told anyone it was worth nearly 200 episodes. I'd rather tell them to watch FMA, One Piece, Mob Psycho, OPM, Avatar, etc.",

But the problems are infuriating.\n\nIm not mad about Naruto not being the perfect dad. Because he doesnt have a dad himself, and never did he say in canon \"i want a family yep.\"\n\nHe said \"I wanna be hokage\". So cool, that takes priority. But WHERE ARE THE SHADOW CLONES?? HELLO?? Where is his super awesome chakra he can work with? Just. Make 4-5 clones and discuss things in a group. BAM, work made easier. The unnecessary drama and people treating it as something perfectly normal ticks me off.\n\nThen everything is resolved but plot twist, the only thing *actually* resolved is \"a dead dad is better than a deadbeat one\". Naruto's busy. Boruto, Hinata and Hima gotta suck it up, period.\n\nSasuke. My man, sasuke. If you didnt like sakura you could've just told it to her fucking face you coward. They're actually very cute in boruto if you ignore gaiden and the 7/8 years + of him not being around, BUT HOW DO YOU IGNORE THAT??\n\nThe time line makes it so that sasuke and sakura have spent what? 2 years together? Because they need babies for the sequel while keeping Og cast \"young enough\". And then he dimension hops but cant hop even a *little* while to konoha to see his daughter? Okay, fine. You made mistakes. But at least make it so that its acknowledged as a mistake and how you wanted to be away from the village that killed your family. But *noooo*, its super important work.\n\nMy worst gripe about boruto: orochimaru.\n\nAre you *really* going to let him live? Then make somebody who is probably traumatized by him (aka yamato) to guard him? Its like kishimoto didnt know where to fit my man, poor, poor, yamato and decided to that to him. Ive always felt like yamato was such a well-adjusted, fresh breath of air from boisterous people. Very level headed. But all of that flew out of the window when I realised that hes just..okay with guarding orochimaru.\n\nNaruto orochimaru and boruto orochimaru are different people; change my mind.\n\nOh and team taka. Of course they're still licking orochimaru's boots. I cant even blame kishimoto here because he didnt even wanna *make* them in the first place but that is such lazy writing since they're here anyway.\n\nYknow what? Take away orochimoomoo and give baby Mitsuki to team taka. Half the problem with the premise solved.\n\nBtw, all of this is paid the least attention. Its all about the ootsuki's like shippuden was about the uchiha but...this needs to be said goddamit.",

There's no relation between Madara not being the last villain and Boruto existing. \n\nHaving Kaguya as the last villain wouldn't have really mattered in any way how Boruto started. Momoshiki arrives just like he did, regardless of whether Kaguya was resurrected or not.\n\nIf talking about milking, Naruto itself is a series that was milked. 100 episodes of continuous nonsensical filler, instead of going on hiatus, and that milking happened waaaay back when it was much smaller show. So by comparison Boruto adopting novels and creating content actually affects and explains canon is much better methodology.",

Yes that was obito's plan until he saw he can't use 2 rinnegans, the only reason obito let kabuto revive madara is bcz he couldn't use inf tsukuyomi him self..",

The thing that triggered the creation of the rinnesharingan is madara absorbing the god tree/ Kaguya eating its fruit. Not having 2 rinnegans lmfao. The only reason obito let kabuto revive madara was because obito couldn't beat edo madara + edo kage + edo jinchuriki + edo akatsuki alone \ud83d\ude02. Why tf would obito become the ttj if he knew he can't use IT? Madara even said obito is going to launch the IT after the tree blooms and guess what. OBITO ONLY HAD A SINGLE RINNEGAN. You do realize the rinnegans on earth are the result of recreating hagoromos Chakra right? Not Kaguyas. And infinite tsukuyomi is Kaguyas jutsu and not hagoromos. Why would you even need hagoromos eyes to use Kaguyas jutsu ffs even Kaguya herself didn't have them \ud83d\udc80",

See, ur trying to twist word around to ur liking so they suit ur bullshit ideas..\nU said it your self, u cannot have inf tsukuyomi without the rinnegans, u need them for the gedo statue, and u also need them to awaken rinne-sharingan.. they aren't needed for inf tsukuyomi  but u need them to awaken rinne-sharingan, why do u think madara kept going around looking for the second rinnegan?",

The only way to get rinnesharingan is through God tree. You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself.

Its in the anime.\n\nThe manga does *not* have that. Shes the one who realised sasuke would leave the village while naruto was going \"nahhh\". Not a sasusaku shipper in canon but just saying that was just unnecessary on the anime's part.\n\nAnd the famous \"who will I save? naruto or sasuke?\" Filler. Bruh, how do you expect anime fans to stay unbiased after *that*? Thats fuel to sakura hate.\n\nAnyway, I dont think its the anime actively propagating against sakura lmao. Just that a lot of her character was butchered for time or \"oh..naruto understood not me\" moments. Also the tsundere thing. Maybe the anime thought if they push her to be a tsundere in the fillers narusaku would be more possible since tsunderes were The Thing back then?",

Some criticism with her writing is valid. But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

He has a ton of great moments, and Ikemoto draws a cool ass Naruto. \n\nIn the anime all anyone needed was the movie or a handful of episodes to see how he's doing. I highly doubt anyone in it just for Naruto watches every single Boruto episode. \n\nAs someone who has seen all of the anime so far, I would be lying if I told anyone it was worth nearly 200 episodes. I'd rather tell them to watch FMA, One Piece, Mob Psycho, OPM, Avatar, etc.",

But the problems are infuriating.\n\nIm not mad about Naruto not being the perfect dad. Because he doesnt have a dad himself, and never did he say in canon \"i want a family yep.\"\n\nHe said \"I wanna be hokage\". So cool, that takes priority. But WHERE ARE THE SHADOW CLONES?? HELLO?? Where is his super awesome chakra he can work with? Just. Make 4-5 clones and discuss things in a group. BAM, work made easier. The unnecessary drama and people treating it as something perfectly normal ticks me off.\n\nThen everything is resolved but plot twist, the only thing *actually* resolved is \"a dead dad is better than a deadbeat one\". Naruto's busy. Boruto, Hinata and Hima gotta suck it up, period.\n\nSasuke. My man, sasuke. If you didnt like sakura you could've just told it to her fucking face you coward. They're actually very cute in boruto if you ignore gaiden and the 7/8 years + of him not being around, BUT HOW DO YOU IGNORE THAT??\n\nThe time line makes it so that sasuke and sakura have spent what? 2 years together? Because they need babies for the sequel while keeping Og cast \"young enough\". And then he dimension hops but cant hop even a *little* while to konoha to see his daughter? Okay, fine. You made mistakes. But at least make it so that its acknowledged as a mistake and how you wanted to be away from the village that killed your family. But *noooo*, its super important work.\n\nMy worst gripe about boruto: orochimaru.\n\nAre you *really* going to let him live? Then make somebody who is probably traumatized by him (aka yamato) to guard him? Its like kishimoto didnt know where to fit my man, poor, poor, yamato and decided to that to him. Ive always felt like yamato was such a well-adjusted, fresh breath of air from boisterous people. Very level headed. But all of that flew out of the window when I realised that hes just..okay with guarding orochimaru.\n\nNaruto orochimaru and boruto orochimaru are different people; change my mind.\n\nOh and team taka. Of course they're still licking orochimaru's boots. I cant even blame kishimoto here because he didnt even wanna *make* them in the first place but that is such lazy writing since they're here anyway.\n\nYknow what? Take away orochimoomoo and give baby Mitsuki to team taka. Half the problem with the premise solved.\n\nBtw, all of this is paid the least attention. Its all about the ootsuki's like shippuden was about the uchiha but...this needs to be said goddamit.",

The only way to get rinnesharingan is through God tree. You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi. And i also said that u can also eat the chakra fruit to awaken it. U are right, u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan without the 10 tails while only having the rinnegans, but u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan either if u don't have the rinnegans and only the 10 tails. both are needed.",

You need THE GOD TREE. Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",

Not a sasusaku shipper in canon but just saying that was just unnecessary on the anime's part.\n\nAnd the famous \"who will I save? naruto or sasuke?\" Filler. Bruh, how do you expect anime fans to stay unbiased after *that*? Thats fuel to sakura hate.\n\nAnyway, I dont think its the anime actively propagating against sakura lmao. Just that a lot of her character was butchered for time or \"oh..naruto understood not me\" moments. Also the tsundere thing. Maybe the anime thought if they push her to be a tsundere in the fillers narusaku would be more possible since tsunderes were The Thing back then?",

Some criticism with her writing is valid. But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

I highly doubt anyone in it just for Naruto watches every single Boruto episode. \n\nAs someone who has seen all of the anime so far, I would be lying if I told anyone it was worth nearly 200 episodes.

But the problems are infuriating.\n\nIm not mad about Naruto not being the perfect dad. Because he doesnt have a dad himself, and never did he say in canon \"i want a family yep.\"\n\nHe said \"I wanna be hokage\". So cool, that takes priority. But WHERE ARE THE SHADOW CLONES?? HELLO?? Where is his super awesome chakra he can work with? Just. Make 4-5 clones and discuss things in a group. BAM, work made easier. The unnecessary drama and people treating it as something perfectly normal ticks me off.\n\nThen everything is resolved but plot twist, the only thing *actually* resolved is \"a dead dad is better than a deadbeat one\". Naruto's busy. Boruto, Hinata and Hima gotta suck it up, period.\n\nSasuke. My man, sasuke. If you didnt like sakura you could've just told it to her fucking face you coward. They're actually very cute in boruto if you ignore gaiden and the 7/8 years + of him not being around, BUT HOW DO YOU IGNORE THAT??\n\nThe time line makes it so that sasuke and sakura have spent what? 2 years together? Because they need babies for the sequel while keeping Og cast \"young enough\". And then he dimension hops but cant hop even a *little* while to konoha to see his daughter? Okay, fine. You made mistakes. But at least make it so that its acknowledged as a mistake and how you wanted to be away from the village that killed your family. But *noooo*, its super important work.\n\nMy worst gripe about boruto: orochimaru.\n\nAre you *really* going to let him live? Then make somebody who is probably traumatized by him (aka yamato) to guard him? Its like kishimoto didnt know where to fit my man, poor, poor, yamato and decided to that to him. Ive always felt like yamato was such a well-adjusted, fresh breath of air from boisterous people. Very level headed. But all of that flew out of the window when I realised that hes just..okay with guarding orochimaru.\n\nNaruto orochimaru and boruto orochimaru are different people; change my mind.\n\nOh and team taka. Of course they're still licking orochimaru's boots. I cant even blame kishimoto here because he didnt even wanna *make* them in the first place but that is such lazy writing since they're here anyway.\n\nYknow what? Take away orochimoomoo and give baby Mitsuki to team taka. Half the problem with the premise solved.\n\nBtw, all of this is paid the least attention. Its all about the ootsuki's like shippuden was about the uchiha but...this needs to be said goddamit.",

There's no relation between Madara not being the last villain and Boruto existing. \n\nHaving Kaguya as the last villain wouldn't have really mattered in any way how Boruto started. Momoshiki arrives just like he did, regardless of whether Kaguya was resurrected or not.\n\nIf talking about milking, Naruto itself is a series that was milked. 100 episodes of continuous nonsensical filler, instead of going on hiatus, and that milking happened waaaay back when it was much smaller show. So by comparison Boruto adopting novels and creating content actually affects and explains canon is much better methodology.",

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi. And i also said that u can also eat the chakra fruit to awaken it. U are right, u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan without the 10 tails while only having the rinnegans, but u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan either if u don't have the rinnegans and only the 10 tails. both are needed.",

You need THE GOD TREE. Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",

Not a sasusaku shipper in canon but just saying that was just unnecessary on the anime's part.\n\nAnd the famous \"who will I save? naruto or sasuke?\" Filler.

Just that a lot of her character was butchered for time or \"oh..naruto understood not me\" moments. Also the tsundere thing. Maybe the anime thought if they push her to be a tsundere in the fillers narusaku would be more possible since tsunderes were The Thing back then?",

Some criticism with her writing is valid. But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

But the problems are infuriating.\n\nIm not mad about Naruto not being the perfect dad. Because he doesnt have a dad himself, and never did he say in canon \"i want a family yep.\"\n\nHe said \"I wanna be hokage\". So cool, that takes priority. But WHERE ARE THE SHADOW CLONES?? HELLO?? Where is his super awesome chakra he can work with? Just. Make 4-5 clones and discuss things in a group. BAM, work made easier. The unnecessary drama and people treating it as something perfectly normal ticks me off.\n\nThen everything is resolved but plot twist, the only thing *actually* resolved is \"a dead dad is better than a deadbeat one\". Naruto's busy. Boruto, Hinata and Hima gotta suck it up, period.\n\nSasuke. My man, sasuke. If you didnt like sakura you could've just told it to her fucking face you coward. They're actually very cute in boruto if you ignore gaiden and the 7/8 years + of him not being around, BUT HOW DO YOU IGNORE THAT??\n\nThe time line makes it so that sasuke and sakura have spent what? 2 years together? Because they need babies for the sequel while keeping Og cast \"young enough\". And then he dimension hops but cant hop even a *little* while to konoha to see his daughter? Okay, fine. You made mistakes. But at least make it so that its acknowledged as a mistake and how you wanted to be away from the village that killed your family. But *noooo*, its super important work.\n\nMy worst gripe about boruto: orochimaru.\n\nAre you *really* going to let him live? Then make somebody who is probably traumatized by him (aka yamato) to guard him? Its like kishimoto didnt know where to fit my man, poor, poor, yamato and decided to that to him. Ive always felt like yamato was such a well-adjusted, fresh breath of air from boisterous people. Very level headed. But all of that flew out of the window when I realised that hes just..okay with guarding orochimaru.\n\nNaruto orochimaru and boruto orochimaru are different people; change my mind.\n\nOh and team taka. Of course they're still licking orochimaru's boots. I cant even blame kishimoto here because he didnt even wanna *make* them in the first place but that is such lazy writing since they're here anyway.\n\nYknow what? Take away orochimoomoo and give baby Mitsuki to team taka. Half the problem with the premise solved.\n\nBtw, all of this is paid the least attention. Its all about the ootsuki's like shippuden was about the uchiha but...this needs to be said goddamit.",

Like if she knows she can't bring herself to kill him but believes that either 1) dying to him is preferable to being forced to fight him because love/obsession or whatever or 2) forcing him into a one-sided fight will make him realize he doesn't really want to slaughter his old friends or the village. \n\nInstead of \"I don't need my backup\" it's \"There's no reason they need to die for this\" and/or \"If the fight isn't super one-sided in Sasuke's favor, then Sasuke will fight for his life instead of having to decide whether or not he'll kill his old friend.\"\n\nInstead of \"I bet I can speed blitz Sasuke\" it's \"Maybe being forced to kill his old teammate will snap him out of his crazy.\" \n\nIt'd still be a dumb plan, but at least it's one that has some inkling of sense behind it (even if that inkling is drowned under the weight of her irrational Sasuke obsession).

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

You need THE GOD TREE. Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",

Not a sasusaku shipper in canon but just saying that was just unnecessary on the anime's part.\n\nAnd the famous \"who will I save? naruto or sasuke?\" Filler. Bruh, how do you expect anime fans to stay unbiased after *that*? Thats fuel to sakura hate.\n\nAnyway, I dont think its the anime actively propagating against sakura lmao. Just that a lot of her character was butchered for time or \"oh..naruto understood not me\" moments. Also the tsundere thing. Maybe the anime thought if they push her to be a tsundere in the fillers narusaku would be more possible since tsunderes were The Thing back then?",

Some criticism with her writing is valid. But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

You need THE GOD TREE. Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",

Some criticism with her writing is valid. But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

I do love Naruto in the manga though. He has a ton of great moments, and Ikemoto draws a cool ass Naruto. \n\nIn the anime all anyone needed was the movie or a handful of episodes to see how he's doing. I highly doubt anyone in it just for Naruto watches every single Boruto episode. \n\nAs someone who has seen all of the anime so far, I would be lying if I told anyone it was worth nearly 200 episodes. I'd rather tell them to watch FMA, One Piece, Mob Psycho, OPM, Avatar, etc.",

Yes the quality isn't 9/10 like Attack on Titan or anything like that. But it's still a solid 7/10 on average and easily an 8 to 8.5 when manga chapter is adapted.",

So I guess it's okay if they develop characters like Sumire and Konohamaru in the anime instead of manga. But these characters getting time in the manga would have been nice, a cherry on top with some cream. But this is good as well, but the WAAAAAIIIITTT.

Yes that was obito's plan until he saw he can't use 2 rinnegans, the only reason obito let kabuto revive madara is bcz he couldn't use inf tsukuyomi him self..",

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi.

Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan.

But saying \"bitch, useless, trash.\" every three seconds is kind of over-the top. Its more of a subtle perspective thing. \n\nSlowly, all the little things start building up along with the filler moments and you cant separate it from her manga self, you know? You cant exactly help who you hate in that situation.\n\nI read up on this more because I got so many replies on this; but apparently she helped naruto duck from Zabuza's sword. So much for someone you viscerally hate.\n\nMaybe the anime didn't consider it important enough to waste their budget on that?? If you've already watched the anime maybe you'd have a pre-set perspective on her. That's not your fault, obviously. Even I wouldn't have escaped unscathed if the anime shoved \"who will i help...naruto or sasuke?\" in my face tbh. Thats such a bitchy thing to do.\n\nItsjust that *after* you read the whole manga and see the fillers she seems like a slightly different character? Sure, she's still short tempered, but SP gave her so much screentime without knowing how to handle her character. She appears far less in the manga so I didnt think she was a tsundere at all.\n\nHer holding both the boy's hands in the chunin exam and then ssaying \"Naruto! No! Shut up!\" when he badmouthed sasuke's clan then seemed more...motherly? big sisterly? to me. Not tsundere-ish. She goes \"you big *idiot*\" with naruto all weakly but she never hits him out of tsundere drama.",

The thing that triggered the creation of the rinnesharingan is madara absorbing the god tree/ Kaguya eating its fruit. Not having 2 rinnegans lmfao. The only reason obito let kabuto revive madara was because obito couldn't beat edo madara + edo kage + edo jinchuriki + edo akatsuki alone \ud83d\ude02. Why tf would obito become the ttj if he knew he can't use IT? Madara even said obito is going to launch the IT after the tree blooms and guess what. OBITO ONLY HAD A SINGLE RINNEGAN. You do realize the rinnegans on earth are the result of recreating hagoromos Chakra right? Not Kaguyas. And infinite tsukuyomi is Kaguyas jutsu and not hagoromos. Why would you even need hagoromos eyes to use Kaguyas jutsu ffs even Kaguya herself didn't have them \ud83d\udc80",

But the tree couldt bloom bcz naruto destroyed it, that's why madara decided to use the rinne-sharingan to activate it. And obito didn't have the rinne-sharingan when he became the ten tails host, that's why u need to either eat a fruit from the ten tails or have 2 rinnegans.

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi. And i also said that u can also eat the chakra fruit to awaken it. U are right, u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan without the 10 tails while only having the rinnegans, but u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan either if u don't have the rinnegans and only the 10 tails. both are needed.",

Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan.

But the tree couldt bloom bcz naruto destroyed it, that's why madara decided to use the rinne-sharingan to activate it. And obito didn't have the rinne-sharingan when he became the ten tails host, that's why u need to either eat a fruit from the ten tails or have 2 rinnegans. See, ur trying to twist word around to ur liking so they suit ur bullshit ideas..\nU said it your self, u cannot have inf tsukuyomi without the rinnegans, u need them for the gedo statue, and u also need them to awaken rinne-sharingan.. they aren't needed for inf tsukuyomi  but u need them to awaken rinne-sharingan, why do u think madara kept going around looking for the second rinnegan?",

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi. And i also said that u can also eat the chakra fruit to awaken it. U are right, u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan without the 10 tails while only having the rinnegans, but u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan either if u don't have the rinnegans and only the 10 tails. both are needed.",

Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",

You are literally making shit up on the spot and it doesn't even make any sense. How would having 2 eyes of hagoromo give you the same ability as eating the Chakra fruit? The ability to cast infinite tsukuyomi comes from the god tree. Kaguya ate its fruit, madara absorbed it. That gave them the rinnesharingan. Idk what's so hard to understand about it. Rinnesharingan and IT come from the god tree,not from hagoromo. Why did madara look for the 2nd rinnegan? Did he? Last time i checked he was fucking around with 8 gates guy, Naruto and then Sasuke. He literally just sent black zetsu to reclaim it. He only went to take the 2nd rinnegan once he started getting his ass handed to him by Naruto and Sasuke. Rinnegan is not needed for the rinnesharingan. God tree is. What do the 2 users of infinite tsukuyomi have in common? Both absorbed the power of the god tree. Either bring proof (which doesn't exist) that it has anything to do with the rinnegan or shut your ass up and accept you were wrong like the other guy who actually has some balls to accept when he's wrong.\n\nAlso hagoromo didn't had rinnesharingan and couldn't use kotoamatsukami so saying his eyes are needed to awaken it is just hilarious, since he had the whole 10 tails and 2 pure rinnegan.",

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi. And i also said that u can also eat the chakra fruit to awaken it. U are right, u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan without the 10 tails while only having the rinnegans, but u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan either if u don't have the rinnegans and only the 10 tails. both are needed.",

Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan.

Why didn't obito have the rinne-sharingan when he was the 10 tails host. What else do u want me to say, it makes sense to need the rinnegans for inf tsukuyomi. And i also said that u can also eat the chakra fruit to awaken it. U are right, u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan without the 10 tails while only having the rinnegans, but u can't awaken the rinne-sharingan either if u don't have the rinnegans and only the 10 tails. both are needed.",

Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",

Rinnesharingan comes form the power of the GOD TREE. Madara got the rinnesharingan by directly absorbing the god tree itself and Kaguya got its power by eating the fruit. Hagoromo didn't do either so he didn't have the rinnesharingan. Obito also did not have the GOD TREES POWER. He was trying to get it but it took way too long for it to bloom. Madara couldn't just use IT before getting the 2nd rinnegan because he would get murdered (sealed) before he could do so. Naruto and Sasuke were literally slapping him around like a punching bag with just one rinnegan so he needed the power of 2 to be not get instantly one shotted by Naruto and Sasuke. If he tried to fly up without dozens of mountain sized meteors and 4 limbo clones protecting him he would lose. The rinnegans are literally irrelevant to unlock the rinnesharingan by itself. I'll try to dumb it down for you.\n\nGod tree = rinnesharingan\nHagoromo = rinnegan\nHagoromo \u2260 rinnesharingan\n\n\nHagoromo had 10 tails + rinnegans and didn't awaken rinnesharingan.\nKaguya had 10 tails and no rinnegans but had the god trees power and she did awaken the rinnesharingan. Why the fuck would you need the eyes of someone who didn't had the rinnesharingan to awaken the rinnesharingan",
