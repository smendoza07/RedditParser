    "body": "[Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1467583wpp/ji-suk-jin-talks-about-a-time-he-almost-left-running-man-and-shares-high-praise-for-yoo-jae-suk)\n\nYoo Jae Suk and Ji Suk Jin recently reminisced about their past together on \u201cYou Quiz on the Block\u201d!\n\nThe May 5 episode of tvN\u2019s \u201cYou Quiz on the Block\u201d was a special titled \u201cPeople Yoo Jae Suk Likes\u201d in celebration of Yoo Jae Suk\u2019s 30th debut anniversary.\n\nThe second friend he introduced was none other than Ji Suk Jin, his longtime close friend. Ji Suk Jin talked about the period of time when Yoo Jae Suk was not famous, sharing, \u201cWhen we both didn\u2019t have work, we would meet up and hang out with other people who had nothing to do at our friend\u2019s studio apartment. I\u2019d ask my mom for 10,000 won (approximately $8.88) and go there.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhenever we\u2019d go to the club together, we wouldn\u2019t have money for snacks so we\u2019d just order one fruit snack and last six hours with that.\u201d Ji Suk Jin also shared, \u201cWhen Yoo Jae Suk wasn\u2019t with us, we said among ourselves, \u2018He\u2019s so funny, we don\u2019t know why he gets like that on broadcasts.\u2019 Park Soo Hong once asked, \u2018Who do you think will be most successful in the future?\u2019 and he picked Yoo Jae Suk.\u201d\n\nYoo Jae Suk responded, \u201cWhen I was having a hard time, I talked a lot about those worries with Park Soo Hong. He would think of ideas for me and repeatedly recommended me on \u2018Our Happy Saturday\u2019 \\[a variety show\\]. He tried to help me, but it didn\u2019t work out well.\u201d\n\nThe two also spoke about their beginnings on \u201cRunning Man,\u201d with Ji Suk Jin revealing that he tried to leave the program at the start because he felt it didn\u2019t match with him. He also expressed his gratitude to Yoo Jae Suk for creating his \u201cbig nose\u201d character for him. Ji Suk Jin added, \u201cI believe that Yoo Jae Suk should earn more money. In the sports industry, the top \\[athletes\\] receive incredible amounts of money. Since Yoo Jae Suk is at the top of the entertainment industry, I think he should get more money.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cYoo Jae Suk thinks a lot about his programs, but I wish he would do that less. Exercising and going to the dermatologist are all so that he can do better for his programs. He should mix in some observation programs, but he only takes difficult shows. However, your health will not support you forever.\u201d\n\nRegarding why he doesn\u2019t appear on observation programs, Yoo Jae Suk explained, \u201cThis is just my personal opinion, but I wonder whether it\u2019s meaningful or if there is a need for me to also hop on the trends and mainstream topics people talk about. If I think filming comfortably is fun for me, I can just find meaning in that, but I also end up thinking about whether I\u2019m earning money too comfortably. I\u2019m not saying that others are like that, but that\u2019s just how I personally think.\u201d",
