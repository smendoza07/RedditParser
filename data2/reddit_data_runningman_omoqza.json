Jae suk and Gary acted so awkward hearing that and they glanced at the back seat where Ji Hyo was sitting.\n\nhonestly if KJK did date her, I think the cast wouldn't tease him about it since they respect each other's private lives and don't mention actual ex's. that's what I gathered from their past experience with dealing with an actual ex on the show lmao",

Jae suk and Gary acted so awkward hearing that and they glanced at the back seat where Ji Hyo was sitting.\n\nhonestly if KJK did date her, I think the cast wouldn't tease him about it since they respect each other's private lives and don't mention actual ex's. that's what I gathered from their past experience with dealing with an actual ex on the show lmao",
