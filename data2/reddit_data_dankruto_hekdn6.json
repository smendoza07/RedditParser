While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka. Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

In fact, I would go as far as to say that saying that Sasuke's and Kakashi's suffering are similar is really a false equivalence. You merely proved my point if anything. \n\nIt's not that both lost everything, it's HOW they lost everything and the circumstances surrounding them. \n\nKakashi wasn't betrayed and told by that loved one whom he idolised that the love was completely fake, and that idol didn't kill everyone whom he loved, and then tells them from a very young age that he has to avenge them. Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge. Oh, and Kakashi didn't have a Curse Mark which only intensified his negative thoughts.",

When he found out Tobi was Obito he couldn\u2019t even move in shock. \n\nSasuke went through one traumatic event. Kakashi went through multiple. He went through a brutal war as a kid. He even died at one point. Sasuke grew up in peace times and had Naruto the bestest friend anyone could ever have who never gave up on him. Sasuke was an insecure teenager who became jealous of Naruto\u2019s growth and went down the wrong path. I\u2019d definitely say Kakashi suffered more.",

If anything, it would be more painful since he had to be the one killing his loved ones for the sake of his village. Just look at Nagato and Yahiko. Yahiko killed himself on Nagato's kunai so Nagato wouldn't have to make that choice or live with the guilt/pain of killing his best friend.\n\nNot only did Itachi kill his beloved family members, but he was also branded a traitor and despised by his village and his brother, the two things he loved most and wanted to protect.",

Sure, Itachi killed his whole clan and Sasuke watched his parents die in front of him. But to pick Ellie's life over those of any of these is in my opinion, and I mean this with respect, completely insane.\n\nI'd rather be any of these characters than live in a world where most people are fucking dead(and there are human corpses everywhere) and there are monsters and people at every turn that will kill me in the most brutal possible ways without hesitation. \n\nAt least Gaara, Sasuke and Kakashi have a world to live in after killing those they've killed.\n\nEdit: and Ellie has to kill strictly using the more brutal  more traumatizing, old fashioned ways.",

He had been ordered not to help battle the fox, which led to him feeling guilty that, had he helped, Minato may have survived.\n* When Kakashi learned that Itachi killed Shisui, he saw it as a failure on his part for not having a better influence on Itachi.\n* He rejected many ninja teams that were assigned to him because they lacked the teamwork that he considered necessary. He eventually had a team that he believed in assigned to him with Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke, but that didn't last long. Kakashi quickly realized the issues Sasuke had and did everything he could to keep Sasuke from going down the wrong path. In doing so, he made the other members of his team, particularly Naruto, feel neglected. He also ultimately failed in his goal regarding Sasuke, which made him feel like a failure as a teacher.\n* He eventually learned that his best friend who he thought had died was still alive, but Obito had become corrupted and \"evil.\" He was able to help in bringing Obito that friend back to the good side, but it wasn't long before Obito truly died.\n\nKakashi faced hardship/pain in nearly every aspect of his life. He rarely had any happy moments and when he did, they were usually short lived. Sure, he's had years to deal with the deaths that occurred when he was younger and come to terms with them, but that doesn't make them or the accompanying pain any less significant. He still experienced that pain when it happened.",

Naruto blames himself for Neji's death despite him willingly sacrificing himself. Naruto and Neji weren't close nor did they interact alot within the series but he still blames himself for it, thats doesnt reflect his pain though.\n\nI didn't say people close to you dying would affect you but the people in question who did die wasn't actually his fault and a few of these cases he wasn't even around, Rin committed suicide, Obito was injured but a body was never found there was no reason to suspect he died, Minato saved the village, maybe even the planet by dying and Kakashi wasnt involved in that. Again he's had a bad one but not compared to anyone else here. I'd argue Naruto has the worst pain",

Itachi made Sasuke feel incredibly weak and humiliation, and as a \"punishment\" he went on to replay for 72 hours how he killed every single clan member, he didn't just stop there after breaking his arm and beating him down. \n\nYou're also underestimating just how much someone's worldview and way of thinking would be affected if they learned that they lived half of their life as a lie. \n\nKakashi lost his parents and some friends.

The clan to sasuke was everything but to kakashi the people he had left we all he had aswell. While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka. Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

Sasuke meanwhile had to watch his own clan get slaughtered one-by-one in that samw period, and THAT was used to reinforce the humility and feelings of weakness Itachi beat into him. Sasuke was literally reminded of his own loss of clan just because he was too weak. Oh and another thing, Kakashi was a grown man who was a deeply experienced shinobi, Sasuke was just a 13yo boy, he was still a kid who still wasn't emotionally developed.",

You merely proved my point if anything. \n\nIt's not that both lost everything, it's HOW they lost everything and the circumstances surrounding them. \n\nKakashi wasn't betrayed and told by that loved one whom he idolised that the love was completely fake, and that idol didn't kill everyone whom he loved, and then tells them from a very young age that he has to avenge them. Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge. Oh, and Kakashi didn't have a Curse Mark which only intensified his negative thoughts.",

Thank you, boboToko for the correction.\n\nI don't think the fact that Itachi killed his family/clan members means he felt less pain. It's not like he really wanted to do those things. If anything, it would be more painful since he had to be the one killing his loved ones for the sake of his village. Just look at Nagato and Yahiko. Yahiko killed himself on Nagato's kunai so Nagato wouldn't have to make that choice or live with the guilt/pain of killing his best friend.\n\nNot only did Itachi kill his beloved family members, but he was also branded a traitor and despised by his village and his brother, the two things he loved most and wanted to protect.",

He had been ordered not to help battle the fox, which led to him feeling guilty that, had he helped, Minato may have survived.\n* When Kakashi learned that Itachi killed Shisui, he saw it as a failure on his part for not having a better influence on Itachi.\n* He rejected many ninja teams that were assigned to him because they lacked the teamwork that he considered necessary. He eventually had a team that he believed in assigned to him with Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke, but that didn't last long. Kakashi quickly realized the issues Sasuke had and did everything he could to keep Sasuke from going down the wrong path. In doing so, he made the other members of his team, particularly Naruto, feel neglected. He also ultimately failed in his goal regarding Sasuke, which made him feel like a failure as a teacher.\n* He eventually learned that his best friend who he thought had died was still alive, but Obito had become corrupted and \"evil.\" He was able to help in bringing Obito that friend back to the good side, but it wasn't long before Obito truly died.\n\nKakashi faced hardship/pain in nearly every aspect of his life. He rarely had any happy moments and when he did, they were usually short lived. Sure, he's had years to deal with the deaths that occurred when he was younger and come to terms with them, but that doesn't make them or the accompanying pain any less significant. He still experienced that pain when it happened.",

The level of emotional trauma Sasuke endured was what pushed him to the path of darkness. Kakashi never felt that combination of trauma, humiliation and weakness that Sasuke did. Itachi made Sasuke feel incredibly weak and humiliation, and as a \"punishment\" he went on to replay for 72 hours how he killed every single clan member, he didn't just stop there after breaking his arm and beating him down. \n\nYou're also underestimating just how much someone's worldview and way of thinking would be affected if they learned that they lived half of their life as a lie. \n\nKakashi lost his parents and some friends. Sasuke lost his family and clan. The Uchiha wasn't just a clan to him, they were his neighbours and his own world. Kakashi was 5 when he lost his dad. Sasuke was only 8 when he lost his entire clan.",

The clan to sasuke was everything but to kakashi the people he had left we all he had aswell. While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka. Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge.

Everyone Sasuke loved was killed by his brother. Obviously the circumstances are different.\n\nAnd Kakashi was betrayed. By Obito. When he found out Tobi was Obito he couldn\u2019t even move in shock. \n\nSasuke went through one traumatic event. Kakashi went through multiple. He went through a brutal war as a kid. He even died at one point. Sasuke grew up in peace times and had Naruto the bestest friend anyone could ever have who never gave up on him. Sasuke was an insecure teenager who became jealous of Naruto\u2019s growth and went down the wrong path. I\u2019d definitely say Kakashi suffered more.",

Thank you, boboToko for the correction.\n\nI don't think the fact that Itachi killed his family/clan members means he felt less pain. It's not like he really wanted to do those things. If anything, it would be more painful since he had to be the one killing his loved ones for the sake of his village. Just look at Nagato and Yahiko. Yahiko killed himself on Nagato's kunai so Nagato wouldn't have to make that choice or live with the guilt/pain of killing his best friend.\n\nNot only did Itachi kill his beloved family members, but he was also branded a traitor and despised by his village and his brother, the two things he loved most and wanted to protect.",

Sakura didn't even know he was an orphan, and she was obsessed with him. \n\nPeople only \"liked/respected\" Sasuke because he was the last possessor of the most powerful bloodline Konoha had. He was left to fend for himself just like Naruto, and never got help for his survivors guilt/PTSD. They were only interested in him cause he was the last Uchiha and they wanted to see the last Uchiha's power.",

No matter how hot Itachi is no girls would even dare to approach him because of his reputation. \n\nYou are really missing the point that this is in comparison to Itachi, I didn't say Sasuke had a good life smartass, are all Sasuke fans as bitchy as you?\n\nThere is no mental health institution in Narutoverse, everyone have to deal with trauma themselves...",

Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge.

The level of emotional trauma Sasuke endured was what pushed him to the path of darkness. Kakashi never felt that combination of trauma, humiliation and weakness that Sasuke did. Itachi made Sasuke feel incredibly weak and humiliation, and as a \"punishment\" he went on to replay for 72 hours how he killed every single clan member, he didn't just stop there after breaking his arm and beating him down. \n\nYou're also underestimating just how much someone's worldview and way of thinking would be affected if they learned that they lived half of their life as a lie. \n\nKakashi lost his parents and some friends. Sasuke lost his family and clan. The Uchiha wasn't just a clan to him, they were his neighbours and his own world. Kakashi was 5 when he lost his dad.

The clan to sasuke was everything but to kakashi the people he had left we all he had aswell. While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka. Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge.

While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka.

A war that took both his best friends from him and the consequences of it lead to the death of his mentor later too.\n\nKakashi finished one of his closest friends off after promising his dying best friend to protect her. He then found out decades later that his best friend\u2019s death was one big, fat lie, and that his best friend was the one hurting everyone. \n\nIt\u2019s arrogant of you to tell other people to not talk and that they lack understanding when you\u2019re not even looking at the other side. Kakashi lost everything too but unlike Sasuke he kept his head up and his smile on. They\u2019ve both gone through lifetimes of emotional trauma, Kakashi knows what Sasuke feels like but Sasuke was too insecure and chose a bad path.",

You merely proved my point if anything. \n\nIt's not that both lost everything, it's HOW they lost everything and the circumstances surrounding them. \n\nKakashi wasn't betrayed and told by that loved one whom he idolised that the love was completely fake, and that idol didn't kill everyone whom he loved, and then tells them from a very young age that he has to avenge them. Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge. Oh, and Kakashi didn't have a Curse Mark which only intensified his negative thoughts.",

Sasuke was an insecure teenager who became jealous of Naruto\u2019s growth and went down the wrong path. I\u2019d definitely say Kakashi suffered more.",

Itachi made Sasuke feel incredibly weak and humiliation, and as a \"punishment\" he went on to replay for 72 hours how he killed every single clan member, he didn't just stop there after breaking his arm and beating him down. \n\nYou're also underestimating just how much someone's worldview and way of thinking would be affected if they learned that they lived half of their life as a lie. \n\nKakashi lost his parents and some friends.

While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka. Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

Kakashi wasn't humiliated by that same person, who punished his weakness by making him watch all of his loved ones get slaughtered for 72 hours straight, which was essentially the same as being brainwashed into seeking revenge.

The raw destruction and unfiltered brutality of war itself can cause trauma, it doesn\u2019t have to be loved ones dying. Most of the WW1 veterans with PTSD got it from the constant roar of guns and bombs and witnessing the carnage of the battlefield. Being short in length doesn\u2019t make something not traumatic, anything can be traumatize you if it hits you mentally hard enough.",

The clan to sasuke was everything but to kakashi the people he had left we all he had aswell. While they were not murdered all by someone he trusted and loved, he did most of that himself and had to endure that as well. Minato was the one person he looked up too as a father figure who was murdered by the monster inside his own student, similar to iruka. Sasuke chose a path of darkness to deal with his problems thanks to itachi, but I feel sasuke always expressed his problems and affected his friends by his issues. \n\nKakashi was more humble about his traumatic backstory which I believe matches sasukes, but even if I were to say it was less horrible the fact that he didn\u2019t rope most of the village into his issues dictates the difference",

Obviously the circumstances are different.\n\nAnd Kakashi was betrayed. By Obito. When he found out Tobi was Obito he couldn\u2019t even move in shock. \n\nSasuke went through one traumatic event. Kakashi went through multiple. He went through a brutal war as a kid. He even died at one point. Sasuke grew up in peace times and had Naruto the bestest friend anyone could ever have who never gave up on him. Sasuke was an insecure teenager who became jealous of Naruto\u2019s growth and went down the wrong path. I\u2019d definitely say Kakashi suffered more.",

It can be horrifying to see anyone get their limbs blown off them wether you know them or not. The raw destruction and unfiltered brutality of war itself can cause trauma, it doesn\u2019t have to be loved ones dying. Most of the WW1 veterans with PTSD got it from the constant roar of guns and bombs and witnessing the carnage of the battlefield. Being short in length doesn\u2019t make something not traumatic, anything can be traumatize you if it hits you mentally hard enough.",
