    "body": "##**Introduction and methods**\n\nI previously did an [analysis of search results by city](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9a9wz9/numbers_of_sbs_sds_and_ratios_by_citycountry/). The main flaw was that it didn't reflect *active* SDs and SBs. It also skipped over several countries, especially in South America, with significant user bases. Time for an update!\n\nThe figures below are a much better reflection of active SDs and SBs. For SDs, I just took the number of search results for Premium and Diamond SDs. (Paying SDs who were inactive for more than a month were rare, as should be the case.) For SBs, most of the results outside the US are manually counted (navigated by 100s and then did a search to see how many times \"months\" appeared on a page, and anything 1 month or greater was deducted from the total). SB figures for most cities in the US are estimated based on an observed active:total ratio of .35. I counted New York results in full through a series of discrete searches separated by height and age. Other results above 1,000 active SBs are estimated based on active:total ratios for other cities in the country/region.\n\nI'm reasonably sure I didn't miss any cities with more than 1,000 active SBs or 100 active SDs, other than perhaps some in the New York and LA metro areas that overlap. I went pretty far down the list of major cities on each continent and in each large country, as well as college towns and a list of metropolitan areas ranked by GDP. Searches for each city were done with distance set to **25 miles** unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n##**Observations**\n\n* The proportion of 1-month active to total SBs (where there were significant numbers of results) ranged from 24% in South America to over 50% in parts of Asia.\n* Active rates in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia were almost always between 33% and 39%, with UK and Australian cities tending toward the higher end. \n* Other than South America, regions outside the US tended to have higher active SB rates.\n* In New York, SBs who were taller and/or older tended to remain more active, ranging from 30% for those under 5 feet tall to 41% for those over 6 feet tall, and 31% for SBs aged 18-21 and 38% for SBs aged 26+.\n* SDs, if you're wondering why you get so many views and messages from South America, wonder no more: there are barely any SDs there. No city in South America has more than 90 Premium SDs. The *least* lopsided city is Guatemala City with a SB:SD ratio of 15.8 - still nearly double the world average - but with only 7 SDs. \n* There are cities with hundreds of SBs and only one or two SDs, and a few cities with dozens of SBs and no SDs (for example, Maraciabo, Venezuela is 153:0 and Kingston, Jamaica is 308:1).\n* After several South American countries, the Philippines seems to be the country with the highest SB:SD ratio, at 24, that has significant numbers of both. Manila still has more SDs than any city in South America.\n* Even with all the non-premium SDs removed, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia still have ratios of around 1:1 or less.\n* In California, cities in the Central Valley and Inland Empire have vastly more SBs per SD than cities on the coasts (around 21:1 vs. 8:1). This is yet another indicator of the huge socioeconomic divide in California. \n* The percentage of SDs who are premium is around 25% in the US. In South America, India, and the Philippines, it's less than 10%. I didn't check other countries/regions.\n\n*Edit: formatting and typos*\n\n\n\n##**Results**\n\n##Cities with >1000 active SBs\n|City|Premium SDs|Active SBs|Ratio|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|New York City,

I'm sure this site represents the largest database of profiles. \n\nBut that's fine, can't get everything.  You geographic analysis is quite comprehensive, and probably covers 80-90% of the S.com population. \n\nUsing the numbers in your report, it's clear that the number of active profiles is below 400,000.   \n\n\nQUESTION - \n\nWhat factor (multiplier) would you use to estimate the universe of active profiles?  \n\nAgain.

(what's the numerator and what's the denominator of this ratio?)\n\nI would actually consider an SB profile that hasn't logged in for more than two weeks inactive, but I wanted to keep things balanced between SD and SB criteria, and it would have taken longer to calculate. I might take a sample at some point to figure out the typical attrition rate and then extrapolate from there. (Any SD can do this, so feel free to contribute!)\n\nThanks.",

Now I know why - Austin's ratio is 6-1 and San Antonio is double that at 12-1!  Houston is even better at 14-1.  Very interesting stuff, thanks again!",

But then I figured people would have complained that there was a difference in criteria between SDs and SBs. Also, think of it this way: if you are an SD active for one month, how many unique, active profiles SB are you going to be able to browse in that time period? The answer to that is roughly the figure I collected. Finally, the one-week figure didn't work for global cities with a small number of SBs that I wanted to include.\n\nIf you would like to do a sampling of 1 week:4 week active profiles, I can report that. I expect that at least within the US, the attrition rate will be similar, the way 1 month:1 year was very consistent. And this means the table above still will give you an accurate idea of the relative concentrations and ratios, even if what you care about is the number of SBs you contact *right now* rather than over the course of a month.",

It was just easiest to set one month as a cutoff because I could hit CTRL-F and type in \"month.\" I was in India and messaged someone with a promising profile. She turned out to be an escort who wanted $500 for dinner or $1000 for an overnight.\n\nSo let's say there were 250 total SB results. On Page 2, I would hit CTRL-F and count the number of hits for the word \"month,\" which would cover \"1 month ago,\" \"2 months ago,\" etc., and then subtract that from 100 to get the total number of profiles active <1 month. So if there were say 85 hits, I would record 115 total SBs (100 on page 1 and 15 on page 2).\n\nEdit: This was a 4-week figure. Search was done last week, so fluctuations can explain the discrepancy. 1 month and higher were excluded.",

Also, think of it this way: if you are an SD active for one month, how many unique, active profiles SB are you going to be able to browse in that time period? The answer to that is roughly the figure I collected. Finally, the one-week figure didn't work for global cities with a small number of SBs that I wanted to include.\n\nIf you would like to do a sampling of 1 week:4 week active profiles, I can report that. I expect that at least within the US, the attrition rate will be similar, the way 1 month:1 year was very consistent. And this means the table above still will give you an accurate idea of the relative concentrations and ratios, even if what you care about is the number of SBs you contact *right now* rather than over the course of a month.",

I compared your numbers with the US Census Bureau 2018 estimate (2018 as per the S.com claims). I took an average population >= 18 years old at 70% (from the Census website). The number S.com quotes is roughly 10 X more than the number you provided.   Take into account that they are marketing their numbers, they most likely use the old political (legal) tactic of \ngerrymandering to make the numbers fit their marketing campaign (and,of course, provide adequate overlapping to boost them).\n\nI'm using an iPhone so I'm very limited in analysis here.",

I compared your numbers with the US Census Bureau 2018 estimate (2018 as per the S.com claims). I took an average population >= 18 years old at 70% (from the Census website). The number S.com quotes is roughly 10 X more than the number you provided.   Take into account that they are marketing their numbers, they most likely use the old political (legal) tactic of \ngerrymandering to make the numbers fit their marketing campaign (and,of course, provide adequate overlapping to boost them).\n\nI'm using an iPhone so I'm very limited in analysis here.",
