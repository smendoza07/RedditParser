I can't believe I let it go on this long. It sucks because we had a real connection--I think that's why I didn't do this sooner\n\n[Here was the text I sent](https://imgur.com/GI0BOMU). I feel like I might have been a bit harsh, but it was how I felt. I just want to know if this was too much.\n\nEdit: oh shit, I forgot it was April fools day.... I hope he doesn't take this as a joke. I'm 100% serious. And I'm not looking for people to tell me I'm stupid for doing this. I know I am and I've already beat myself over this enough. This is a learning experience for me",

            "body": "Generally effective to provide yourself a plan for various contingencies in business.  \n\nThe basic principle is to price on value and manage on cost.  Your costs are time and whatever takes place in that time, plus maintenance costs associated with the venture.  Your value may be greatly enhanced by tangibles and intangibles that increase perceived values.  Service with a smile gets better tips, for example.  An intangible.  To a very great extent, a client's particular needs determine what is valuable.  For example, in this field, real freckles and nice overalls do more for this particular individual than nice hose and lots of makeup.  Market analysis can help guide the value end of the equation.  \n\nThe actual value to you can be so many things, but likely helpful to consider them in terms of $.  Mentorship/guidance/education are extremely valuable in the long term.  For example, I do things involving very very sharps blades.  Having me teach how to sharpen gives a lifetime of properly sharp edges.  That's something fairly useful.  Actual cash is useful.  But having someone set up and make very modest deposits in an IRA for you may end up being much more valuable.  Having someone gladly review your masters thesis - especially someone used to having graduate students - may save you weeks of time and gain better respect.  Contacts are also valuable.  How many times have I quietly introduced a pretty friend to a senior friend who needs general assistance in the law office or financial firm?  These all play into value to you and are measures equivalent to payment.  Best to consider ahead how you will think about these things.\n\nAnd then the contingencies.  What if you don't get what you value?  Ask.  Ask if there's a contact.  Ask if you can learn how hedge investments work.  Ask if your trading partner can teach you how to perform precision shooting.  Ask whether he / she can help you learn to cook that incredible BBQ he / she fixed.  Ask whether he can review the term paper.  Mention you'd like to get better tires than you can afford.  Gently and gracefully.  \n\nAnd if the requests are not met, if he is too busy, decide why and when you will do something.  That asking is the first step.  Then you need a subtle and indirect warning.   Then the termination.  \"Terribly sorry, old chap, but we must now sever relations.  I am destroying all communications and documentation suggesting we know each other, including this one, and trust you will do the same.\"  If you have this prepared ahead of time you can avoid angsty solutions made at the time.  And do be brief.  And final.\n\nPeace",

Even with the best control of identifying information, there is a chance that information showing what might be considered socially unacceptable or illegal activity will come out.  One should consider how to handle this in interviews and responses to inquiries from employers.  Even if not directly approached, such information may influence whether someone hires you or the other finalist.\n\nAll considerations.  Luck also plays such a large role in how things roll out over time.",
