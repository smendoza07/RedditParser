    "body": "So I find it really interesting how these self-proclaimed SB YouTubers try so hard to make it seem like they live this glamorous SB lifestyle without providing any sugar. There are two that really come to mind, both are based out of Dallas, TX for those who may have watched their videos. One is clearly a woman who has a history of escorting (which there is nothing wrong with that at all!) and she also seems to provide \u201csensual massages\u201d to her \u201cclients\u201d who she also claims are her SDs. She disguises these behaviors as a SB lifestyle and shares a variety of digital content and \u201ccoaching calls\u201d for girls who want to be \u201csuccessful SBs\u201d like her. I just think it\u2019s so lame to sell content and basically boast that your content will help girls secure a good SR when in reality what she really does isn\u2019t sugaring at all. I\u2019m very tired of the \u201cfinesse these old worthless men\u201d type content on YouTube. I think there\u2019s so many people out there who just really don\u2019t understand how a SR is supposed to work. These content creators just give off a very slut-shaming type of energy when they act like they never had to do anything sexual with their \u201cSDs\u201d and I just think it\u2019s so lame. Especially with the influx of young and possibly naive women who are attracted to the sugar lifestyle as it is heavily glorified. I think it\u2019s harmful to act like sexual intimacy is not required at all. When promoting or discussing a SR these creators should be honest about how most SRs will not be platonic and will indeed involve intimacy but obviously at the discretion of the adults involved. Feeding their viewers fantasies about plantonic arrangements when they are possibly being intimate with their SDs is just so problematic to me.",

I have felt this way for a while also as she\u2019s always saying things that sound kind of slut \u201cshame-y\u201d lol. Basically stating how she hasn\u2019t EVER slept with an SD and how if other women feel that they want to thats \u201cfine\u201d but it\u2019s just not what she \u201cgives up easily\u201d. Now I\u2019m all for makin em \u201csweat\u201d you at least a little bit before having sex but to truly act like you are getting your rent paid, and expensive gifts and the whole 9 yards just because you\u2019re \u201ccute\u201d is kind of misleading TO ME. But to each their own I just feel like most of these SD\u2019s are not foolish with their money and shouldn\u2019t be treated as such.",

But that's getting rarer and rarer because it is very old school.  \n\n\nedit to add: and this is likely because the world used to be more slut shamey so those traditional values are still in place for some people. I imagine there are more older SDs who are like this - partially low libido, partially those older values.",

Haha , and if couching it in being traditional protects their feelings then I don't see any reason not to.

He had a couple of ppm escorts he would occasionally visit but he'd take me between states, we'd get hotels, I'd work in strip clubs (he'd stop in and buy dances sometimes and throw money at me to get other dudes to throw money too) and then me and him would go to restaurants, or spas, I'd give him dances in the hotel, etc.   \nI made more than the ppm escorts did, and all the perks were great and super fun for me at the time (I was like 22 lol) but honestly I spent so much emotional energy and so much time with him that I burned out super hard, and I basically had no boundaries because since I wasn't giving him sex, he expected WAY more from me on every other level.  I also felt too uncomfortable to really negotiate what he was paying me since I wasn't giving him sex.\n\nI'm also lucky because he was a really great dude and he was fun to be around and wasn't keen on trying to take advantage of me but I could've ended up in a way worse situation tbh.",

You can't say \"nothing against prostitutes\" while also claiming they are \"lowering themselves.\" Also, speak for yourself...I have NEVER, not once, felt I lost an ounce of dignity by engaging in an intimate SR for money.

Lol, do you think I haven\u2019t ever had a man spoil me and give me money without being intimate with him? You\u2019re sadly mistaken. My current SD not only gave me a hefty amount of money but also spent a very large amount of money on me before we even moved to intimacy so PLEASE save the pretentious \u201csome women just know how to get it without intimacy\u201d cause assuming definitely makes an ass out of you and me lol. Even as a SB that has had a platonic arrangement before I refuse to stand on some high horse and look down upon other women who\u2019s SRs involved intimacy. Way to support women some of you, NOT! However that\u2019s not the point I was making. My point is that it\u2019s not going to happen for the vast majority of SBs out there. I believe that MOST SDs are not going to throw thousands of dollars at a woman and not expect some form sexual intimacy in return whether it be penetrative or just oral sex. This is a hill I will die on. Of course there are SDs out there who just really need companionship and will pay for that without intimacy being required DUHHHH but for these YouTubers to basically insinuate that you\u2019re a disgusting, low-value slut if you decide to be intimate with your SD is problematic to me and that\u2019s the only point I was trying to make. Especially when they are clearly lying to their viewers about never being intimate with their SD themselves. Sex is also never \u201crequired\u201d unless two consenting parties agree.",

I\u2019m talking about SB YouTubers basically shaming women who do decide to be intimate within their SRs. You think real SBs don\u2019t know how to make a man want to empty his wallet by delaying sex? It\u2019s the oldest trick in the book however that dynamic might not be realistic for every SB and so for these content creators to sell this dream to naive and new aspiring SBs is concerning to me especially since they may not be practicing what they preach. What people have got to understand is that most SRs in some way may require some form of sexual intimacy and if that\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d for some then they should get out of the bowl.",

Check out this forum, there was a question asking SDs what makes an SB good at sex. Most said that her wanting to have sex and orgasming a lot was a big part of it. Sorry that you had such a negative experience with sexuality, but most people are happy to please the person they are with sexually. \n\nI think if you have such a negative view then you'll attract partners who are negative too. Ofcourse you won't attract a kinky awesome partner if you feign asexuality.",

You are very much allowed to take your own sexual satisfaction into account when choosing an SD. \n\nNow if you're getting into relationships with people you aren't into at all, that's honestly on you and not on your partner for having sexual needs and wanting those needs met in an adult, romantic relationship. \n\nLet the platonics find each other. But what OP is ranting about are the inflencers that wildly mislead newbie SBs and think being disingenuous and lying their way into an SR is the proper way to be an SB. Or telling SBs that platonic is way more common than they think which just sets them up for failure and more vulnerable to scammers.",

That's why I said that the platonics can get together with other platonics. \n\nWhat I don't understand about your argument is the bit about \"using intimacy as a commodity to be sold to anyone who walks up to the counter\". Because that's not what SRs that do have a sexual component are about either? Isn't the vetting process all about NOT being intimate with just anyone who comes up? And how slf in particular advocate for SBs who can't stand having sex with their SDs to end things? \n\nIt just speaks of this weird 60's mindset that men are pigs for wanting sex because women merely tolerate it.

That dynamic in theory shouldn\u2019t exist in SRs as intimacy is usually expected anyway. Just sounds like a boring and difficult arrangement to me. My rule of thumb is finding a SD I\u2019m actually attracted to. Idc how much money a man has, I won\u2019t pursue an arrangement if I\u2019m not attracted to him but some women are just different I guess. I\u2019m not that desperate to sleep with a man I\u2019m not attracted to.",

I\u2019m talking about SB YouTubers basically shaming women who do decide to be intimate within their SRs. You think real SBs don\u2019t know how to make a man want to empty his wallet by delaying sex? It\u2019s the oldest trick in the book however that dynamic might not be realistic for every SB and so for these content creators to sell this dream to naive and new aspiring SBs is concerning to me especially since they may not be practicing what they preach. What people have got to understand is that most SRs in some way may require some form of sexual intimacy and if that\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d for some then they should get out of the bowl.",

Check out this forum, there was a question asking SDs what makes an SB good at sex. Most said that her wanting to have sex and orgasming a lot was a big part of it. Sorry that you had such a negative experience with sexuality, but most people are happy to please the person they are with sexually. \n\nI think if you have such a negative view then you'll attract partners who are negative too.

If you aren't attracted to him why is he your SD?\n\n>actually IS what women have been doing for most of human evolution.\n\nThen people wouldn't exist...\n\n>Would a sugar daddy give any money to a woman who's having mind-blowing orgasms with him?\n\nHell yeah they would (and they do), many prefer that she has mind blowing orgasms. Check out this forum, there was a question asking SDs what makes an SB good at sex. Most said that her wanting to have sex and orgasming a lot was a big part of it. Sorry that you had such a negative experience with sexuality, but most people are happy to please the person they are with sexually. \n\nI think if you have such a negative view then you'll attract partners who are negative too. Ofcourse you won't attract a kinky awesome partner if you feign asexuality.",

Why not cut out all that crap and just embrace the fact that you enjoy sex just as much and just ... enjoy it. My best relationship was like that, we had sex everyday for over a year, never fought or argued, enjoyed the great outdoors together as much as possible, etc. You are just depriving yourself of enjoyment, complicating relationships, and playing games for what, to honor the craft of your ancestors?! You must be kidding...",

Check out this forum, there was a question asking SDs what makes an SB good at sex. Most said that her wanting to have sex and orgasming a lot was a big part of it. Sorry that you had such a negative experience with sexuality, but most people are happy to please the person they are with sexually. \n\nI think if you have such a negative view then you'll attract partners who are negative too. Ofcourse you won't attract a kinky awesome partner if you feign asexuality.",

Because that's not what SRs that do have a sexual component are about either? Isn't the vetting process all about NOT being intimate with just anyone who comes up? And how slf in particular advocate for SBs who can't stand having sex with their SDs to end things? \n\nIt just speaks of this weird 60's mindset that men are pigs for wanting sex because women merely tolerate it.
