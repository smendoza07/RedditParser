    "body": "I\u2019ve only been an SD for 6 months. Not a newbie but also not an expert. This forum has helped me understand the bowl a bit more and truly guided me through some interesting situations. \n\nThis forum has a lot of the bad scenarios so I wanted to start one to talk about the coolest / kindest things an SD has done (or if you\u2019re an SD, what you\u2019ve done). \n\nThis is NOT to talk about just how rich one is but rather that was kind, cool, super romantic, UNF! \n\nWhy? I\u2019m curious and want to learn.\n\nHere\u2019s one from me...my SB barely gets by working at the family store. she just got out of a bad SD relationship where she felt she was controlled and lost her confidence. She never got her HS diploma.\n\nlast month, beyond the allowance, I paid for a tutor for her, set up a side fund for her community college (when she attends), and committed to spend a few hours when we\u2019re together to study...\n\nWho\u2019s next ?",
