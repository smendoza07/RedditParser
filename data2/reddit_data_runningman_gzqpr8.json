                                            "body": "Actually, South Korea has [currently](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Seoul-returns-to-strict-distancing-as-coronavirus-cases-spike) re-imposed strict social distancing and closed entertainment venues in Seoul through to 14 June due to new clusters appearing. Essentially, [since](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200607000053&np=6&mp=1) the Itaweon clusters, they've also been battling church-related and other disparate clusters - it's why I mentioned. There are [worries](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200609000236) that the clusters popping up will lead to a bigger surge. Masks are a good caution either way!\n\nWhile South Korea's response is commendable, especially next to the anemic response of the US and whatever in great hell is going down in the UK, let's not forget that [Taiwan](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3945599) has not seen another local case in 59 days, [Vietnam](https://globalvoices.org/2020/06/10/censorship-tactics-overshadow-vietnams-successful-covid-19-response/) has more or less stopped at 300+ cases and 0 deaths, and [New Zealand](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/08/871822321/with-no-current-cases-new-zealand-lifts-remaining-covid-19-restrictions) has completely eradicated the virus. In light of these comparative performances, I'd really be more inclined to award 'one of the safest' status to a country not currently battling flare-ups.\n\nEdited to add: It's also worth taking a look at the recent [ranking](https://www.dkv.global/covid-safety-assessment-200-regions) released by Deep Knowledge Group, which gives countries a safety ranking based off various factors such as quarantine efficiency, monitoring, and detection. South Korea has scored 10th. For perspective, Switzerland and Germany are in the top two. The point isn't the ranking - it's about the data points they use to make that evaluation. Either way, the current WHO guidance is [mask usage](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200608/who-changes-stance-says-public-should-wear-masks), and my comment is really in light of: A) the current Seoul situation, and B) the WHO guidance.",
