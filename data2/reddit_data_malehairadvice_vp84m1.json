Also I don't see the problem honestly, 9/10 comments on this post are in the lines of \"both look good\" which is an objective truth. \n\nDo you have anything constructive to add ? \n\nOr are you just here to show everyone how \"real\" you are and how you \"always say what you're thinking\". \n\nbtw, \"I thought initially you were trying to make a silly face\" , is not as funny as you think it is. Would you say to someone with no left arm \"I thought initially that you were hiding it under your jacket ? \"\n\nIt's insensitive",
