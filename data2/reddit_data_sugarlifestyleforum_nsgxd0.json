    "body": "Hey gang, I posted a spiel asking about what the difficulties would be of finding an SD post chemo- but turns out with the right SD it can be very undifficult!\n\nI've been seeing my new SD for a few weeks now and I'm floored, I never actually knew that an arrangement could be so fulfilling- emotionally, physically and all that\n\nBefore meeting my new SD I had been scrolling through Seeking for weeks, went on a couple of pot dates, texted/called several pots but they always seemed to be too busy to solidify actual plans of meeting. I was honestly getting so tired of seeing the same profiles but kept up being active on the site (more chance of been seen then I believe?) Then randomly this guy messages me, and his message shows he has clearly ready my profile and is interested. I thought it was weird that I'd literally never seen him on the site before? Turns out he decided to hide his profile and just message who he liked. I guess a lesson here is to not give up, there could be the right SD out there for you and you don't even know he exists yet. And also, of course, craft a stand-out profile (lots of great advice on that here)\n\nWithin the first day of messaging he's sent me a clear face pic, we've had great non creepy convos and he's booked dinner for the following week. Right there I knew he had great potential because he followed through so quickly and we could be clear about our expectations on both ends. This really got me thinking that the best piece of advice I can give is that if a pot SD is not quick to act on his interest, or if it all feels like a wild goose chase, he probably isn't worth it- not always the case of course. But  really, when you experience how easy a good arrangement feels you just think wow, why can't every pot be like this? Efficient, respectful, clear etc etc\n\nBasically on our M & G we really hit it off and I decided to say hey, btw, I finished chemo a bit ago and just wanted to be honest about that, and he was so not bothered by it. Also thanks to who recommended wig glue cos damn that thing stays on throughout the whole night if you know what I mean! \n\nSo at this point I've seen him 4x, I'm really attracted to him and actually look forward to seeing him next- wild huh? And to top it all off I had an excellent recent pet scan! My medical team have said I'm in the clear and can enjoy normality to the max! I mean is any of this normal? Who cares I guess, I'm enjoying abnormality too if that's what most people would call the bowl life\n\nThanks everyone for reading and for commentating on my previous chemo post x",

At least she found out his true colors before marriage, but like, it was maybe the worst thing ever for her.
