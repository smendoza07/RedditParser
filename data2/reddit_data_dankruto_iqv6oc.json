Though Itachi wasn't really intend on killing at that time, even if she stated that Root would kill children too if ordered. She overestimated Itachi because he was still a child, and she believed he hasn't been trained on his sharingan usage like the average older Uchihas. But she did tell Shisui and Itachi to turn around and forget what they have seen, being somewhat gentle to children at first, despite going sadistic on her eagle-masked anbu victim. \n\nThe Root anbu had to retreat very soon afterwards and she was quickly released from her trap by Itachi or the large root anbu with the sword. We don't see that trio of Anbu again, but bet that she was afterwards traumatized by being trapped in her own technique fighting an 8 year old? \n\nI'm not very sure but at the end of the episode, where 11 year old Itachi joins the anbu and walked into a dark locker room, you can see a female anbu on the left with the same hairstyle, body build and mask. This left me with quite some speculations about her.",

Sure Itachi was not that best brother lmao, (and he himself admits that, telling Sasuke he doesn\u2019t have to forgive him), but he did what he did for what he believe to be the greater good.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Itachi was willing to kill random Jinchuriki in order to not give up his position in the akatsuki. He wanted Sasuke to get strong enough to take down \u201cMadara\u201d presumably because he knew he couldn\u2019t on his on due to his \u201csickness\u201d maybe.\nItachi was one that would sacrifice the small for the many.\n\nHe\u2019s definitely not perfect, like some make him out to be, and I never think that was Kishimotos intention to portray him as a perfect moral being. He is a tragic hero that did messed up things for the greater good, and definitely one of my favorite characters.",

The other 2 times where someone was actually put into a coma, they were bedded for like a week, before Tsunade came. No reason at all to assume it\u2019ll be \u201cforever\u201d lmao. \nBut somehow, medics, who are somehow experts at tsukiyomi induced comas, say their never going to wake up, according to their future sight abilities?

Though Itachi wasn't really intend on killing at that time, even if she stated that Root would kill children too if ordered. She overestimated Itachi because he was still a child, and she believed he hasn't been trained on his sharingan usage like the average older Uchihas. But she did tell Shisui and Itachi to turn around and forget what they have seen, being somewhat gentle to children at first, despite going sadistic on her eagle-masked anbu victim. \n\nThe Root anbu had to retreat very soon afterwards and she was quickly released from her trap by Itachi or the large root anbu with the sword. We don't see that trio of Anbu again, but bet that she was afterwards traumatized by being trapped in her own technique fighting an 8 year old? \n\nI'm not very sure but at the end of the episode, where 11 year old Itachi joins the anbu and walked into a dark locker room, you can see a female anbu on the left with the same hairstyle, body build and mask. This left me with quite some speculations about her.",

Sure Itachi was not that best brother lmao, (and he himself admits that, telling Sasuke he doesn\u2019t have to forgive him), but he did what he did for what he believe to be the greater good.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Itachi was willing to kill random Jinchuriki in order to not give up his position in the akatsuki. He wanted Sasuke to get strong enough to take down \u201cMadara\u201d presumably because he knew he couldn\u2019t on his on due to his \u201csickness\u201d maybe.\nItachi was one that would sacrifice the small for the many.\n\nHe\u2019s definitely not perfect, like some make him out to be, and I never think that was Kishimotos intention to portray him as a perfect moral being.

She overestimated Itachi because he was still a child, and she believed he hasn't been trained on his sharingan usage like the average older Uchihas. But she did tell Shisui and Itachi to turn around and forget what they have seen, being somewhat gentle to children at first, despite going sadistic on her eagle-masked anbu victim. \n\nThe Root anbu had to retreat very soon afterwards and she was quickly released from her trap by Itachi or the large root anbu with the sword. We don't see that trio of Anbu again, but bet that she was afterwards traumatized by being trapped in her own technique fighting an 8 year old? \n\nI'm not very sure but at the end of the episode, where 11 year old Itachi joins the anbu and walked into a dark locker room, you can see a female anbu on the left with the same hairstyle, body build and mask. This left me with quite some speculations about her.",

He genuinely cared for his teammates. Sure he was overly confident and edgy, but the lengths he went to protect his comrades (letting himself be struck by needles, using his body to prevent Naruto from hitting a tree despite being in bad condition) was his redeeming quality.",

She overestimated Itachi because he was still a child, and she believed he hasn't been trained on his sharingan usage like the average older Uchihas. But she did tell Shisui and Itachi to turn around and forget what they have seen, being somewhat gentle to children at first, despite going sadistic on her eagle-masked anbu victim. \n\nThe Root anbu had to retreat very soon afterwards and she was quickly released from her trap by Itachi or the large root anbu with the sword. We don't see that trio of Anbu again, but bet that she was afterwards traumatized by being trapped in her own technique fighting an 8 year old? \n\nI'm not very sure but at the end of the episode, where 11 year old Itachi joins the anbu and walked into a dark locker room, you can see a female anbu on the left with the same hairstyle, body build and mask. This left me with quite some speculations about her.",

The other 2 times where someone was actually put into a coma, they were bedded for like a week, before Tsunade came.

The other 2 times where someone was actually put into a coma, they were bedded for like a week, before Tsunade came. No reason at all to assume it\u2019ll be \u201cforever\u201d lmao. \nBut somehow, medics, who are somehow experts at tsukiyomi induced comas, say their never going to wake up, according to their future sight abilities?
