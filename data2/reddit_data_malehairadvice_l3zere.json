First get a proper haircut, i recommend getting a buzz on the sides and getting a trim on the top.\n**Do not** use water pomade or gel or moose on your hair (It will continue giving you that mop look) \n\nIf you want more of a natural finish with style I highly recommend sticking with Clay, Styling Cream or Wax hair products. They will give you a low shine with a matte finish and it will leave your hair looking good and healthy (It's what you're looking for)\n\nI shower, blow dry my hair on low and wait for a mild-damp feel and I use Paul Mitch Reformer Texturizing Hair Putty. **The key:** using less is more, start with just a little bit and continue applying until you get the style you're looking for!\n\n**Note:** There are so many products out there, but start with Mitch Reformer. Avoid Wax if you can, it will dry your scalp, and no one will be able to play with your hair :) I hope this helps, would love to get a DM on your finish look!",

My hair, when it\u2019s shorter like this, has a pretty similar texture to it from shampooing.  OP, I\u2019m guessing you use shampoo during every shower so I would look into co-washing.  Shampooing makes my hair poof into a ball like that and makes it feel very dry, so I only do it 1-2 times a week and use a little bit of conditioner every shower.  Find a conditioner that works well for you, give your hair a couple weeks to adjust and balance it\u2019s oils out, and you should see much less frizz and be able to move your hair how you want it  little bit more without necessarily adding product.",

Looking at OP\u2019s hair, I\u2019d guess that they could ease up on washing. \n\nAnother thing to consider is how aggressive you\u2019re being with a towel + comb. I usually pat my hair dry and try to be gentle with a towel. Some folks recommend a t shirt or something softer. Definitely don\u2019t aggressively scrub at your head with a towel because that\u2019ll fuck things up too.",

In addition, the hair surfaces showed an overall tendency to become more damaged as the temperature increased, with the most severe surface damage produced after drying with the highest temperature (95\u2103). No cortex damage was noted in any group, suggesting that the surface of the hair might play a role as a barrier to prevent cortex damage. The cortex might be more damaged with increased repetition of the process, when the barrier of hair surface is broken. The CMC was damaged only in the naturally dried group. This result was quite unexpected, because increased temperatures generally led to more hair damage. It took over 2 h to dry the hair tress completely under ambient conditions. The hair shaft swells when in contact with water, as does the delta-layer of the CMC. The delta-layer is the sole route through which water diffuses into hair16, and so we speculate that the CMC could be damaged when it is in contact with water for prolonged periods. Longer contact with water might be more harmful to the CMC compared to temperature of hair drying.",

            "body": "I see a lot of frizz happening as it is drying. It might be the lighting but your hair looks on the coarser side to me. On top of being straight, that is a difficult combo to deal with!! Coarse hair has a very tight and thick cuticle layer surrounding the cortex of your hair, which makes it resistant to styling and moisture, so it tends to run on the dryer side of things. A professional smoothing/moisturizing shampoo and conditioner should help! You can also use hair oil to help control the frizz, dont use too much though or you will look greasy. Your hair needs acidic ingredients to help lower the pH. awapuhi wild ginger is a GREAT ingredient to look for in products. They are a little bit of an investment, but the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi line is fantastic. If you do plan on blow drying like other users have suggested, I would wait until your hair is a bit longer, otherwise it will be difficult to control. when you blow dry, apply some of your product to your wet hair and work it through. Use a heat protectant!!!! Blow drying can damage your hair, yes, but what is actually happening is you are breaking hydrogen bonds within your hair, and this allows for the change in style. Start at the root of your hair and move it in the direction you would like to style. Do not blow the air up the hair shaft (toward your scalp), use the blow drying on the hair away from you. Blowing the hot hair UP toward the scalp causes the cuticle to blow open, causing frizz. This will take some practice!!! Paul Mitchell Boomerang restyling mist is a GREAT product to have on hand. No hold to your style, but you can wet down your hair with it to restyle and reactivate your hair product without causing a lot of frizz like water sometimes can, plus it is hydrating. I use it a lot when I have unruly bedhead and I need to fix some spots lol. Do not use fine tooth combs to comb your hair when dry or wet, these cause breakage. A brush with a cushion-y center (when you press on the bristles they should all go down easily), is safe to use on wet or dry hair, less tension on your hairs. Dont worry too much about styling products right now. There are LOTS and it is trial and error for what works for your hair. Sorry for the gigantic wall of text, I just get excited when someone is actually interested in what is best for their hair! Most people shrug me off :( lol",

I have many clays, water based & unorthodox water based pomades, oil based pomades, waxes, cremes, pastes, tonics, pre stylers, texture sprays etc. The main thing I would recommend before any of those (and all those things have a place and are important) would be just try a hair oil. That's the #1 thing for me that keeps my hair in a domain that just allows everything else to work properly and have desirable results. I recommend argan oil as a go to, you can get 4oz which will last a long time for under $20 on amazon. My favorite oil is cloud control from Blumaan but I feel it's a bit pricey but still worth it. Shear revival saw bones oil also good or even Lockharts groom cream. Also I try to only use shampoo 1 time / week ideally 3 times / week max, everyday is way too much.",

My hair, when it\u2019s shorter like this, has a pretty similar texture to it from shampooing.  OP, I\u2019m guessing you use shampoo during every shower so I would look into co-washing.  Shampooing makes my hair poof into a ball like that and makes it feel very dry, so I only do it 1-2 times a week and use a little bit of conditioner every shower.  Find a conditioner that works well for you, give your hair a couple weeks to adjust and balance it\u2019s oils out, and you should see much less frizz and be able to move your hair how you want it  little bit more without necessarily adding product.",

Looking at OP\u2019s hair, I\u2019d guess that they could ease up on washing. \n\nAnother thing to consider is how aggressive you\u2019re being with a towel + comb. I usually pat my hair dry and try to be gentle with a towel. Some folks recommend a t shirt or something softer.

In addition, the hair surfaces showed an overall tendency to become more damaged as the temperature increased, with the most severe surface damage produced after drying with the highest temperature (95\u2103). No cortex damage was noted in any group, suggesting that the surface of the hair might play a role as a barrier to prevent cortex damage. The cortex might be more damaged with increased repetition of the process, when the barrier of hair surface is broken. The CMC was damaged only in the naturally dried group. This result was quite unexpected, because increased temperatures generally led to more hair damage. It took over 2 h to dry the hair tress completely under ambient conditions. The hair shaft swells when in contact with water, as does the delta-layer of the CMC. The delta-layer is the sole route through which water diffuses into hair16, and so we speculate that the CMC could be damaged when it is in contact with water for prolonged periods. Longer contact with water might be more harmful to the CMC compared to temperature of hair drying.",

That's the #1 thing for me that keeps my hair in a domain that just allows everything else to work properly and have desirable results. I recommend argan oil as a go to, you can get 4oz which will last a long time for under $20 on amazon. My favorite oil is cloud control from Blumaan but I feel it's a bit pricey but still worth it. Shear revival saw bones oil also good or even Lockharts groom cream. Also I try to only use shampoo 1 time / week ideally 3 times / week max, everyday is way too much.",

That's the #1 thing for me that keeps my hair in a domain that just allows everything else to work properly and have desirable results. I recommend argan oil as a go to, you can get 4oz which will last a long time for under $20 on amazon. My favorite oil is cloud control from Blumaan but I feel it's a bit pricey but still worth it. Shear revival saw bones oil also good or even Lockharts groom cream. Also I try to only use shampoo 1 time / week ideally 3 times / week max, everyday is way too much.",

No cortex damage was noted in any group, suggesting that the surface of the hair might play a role as a barrier to prevent cortex damage. The cortex might be more damaged with increased repetition of the process, when the barrier of hair surface is broken. The CMC was damaged only in the naturally dried group. This result was quite unexpected, because increased temperatures generally led to more hair damage. It took over 2 h to dry the hair tress completely under ambient conditions.
