What I've been finding is I'm being approached on even non-dating sites and after talking for a while have been asked for money, even before a date! It's happened here as well a few times when I've been DM'd (on Reddit where I don't even see a profile, description or picture!) and eventually asked for money long distance with sometimes not even the pretense of being interested in me. Just a plea for help.\n\nA few other times I've started seeing someone that I met in a totally vanilla way who asked for an allowance after a few dates. Like out of the clear blue. Or sometimes in text messages before meeting, like in a seemingly nonchalant sort of way, \"Oh, btw, would you mind....\" I get the feeling this is because the idea of an eventual 'serious' relationship is not even being considered as a possibility.\n\nI go shopping at the supermarket on Sundays and there's always a guy sitting on the sidewalk with a cup in his hand. I usually give him a $5 every time I see him. He's sitting there because it's a good spot to collect and so maybe is Reddit and other sites where there are guys already in the thought mode of giving money to a woman.  \n\nI have ex-GFs I'm still platonic friends with who dabble in sugaring. They are also looking for vanilla dates. One found she can help her finances by banging her plug lol and her live-in BF benefits thereby as well, lol. Others are finding there is such a tsunami of SBs now, the competition has gotten horrible for any but the very most desirable. \n\nSo, why is this happening? Sex is now an accepted commodity. The shame is gone; the stigma is gone and asking for money. I think there's a problem looking for a solution in this on both sides of the equation and the advent of sugaring and poly and kink in overlapping social circles has made it all very acceptable. \n\nThe men are looking for access to the best women they can get and that usually means qualities other than money. Women are of course also looking for other qualities in a guy, but the primary focus of sugaring is money. For many, it is actually a job - and the distinction between full time, part time and occasional is kind of meaningless. \n\nBack to the OP, the motivations of men vs women in this are naturally opposing forces. It's just as logical for a woman to try to increase allowance as it is for a guy to try to decrease it.",

I'm in my Early 40s now but I have been doing this for a decade and I do run into some women now and then who get into some high ppm mindset and they only expect to meet once a month or something. It doesn't work out for me because they assume if they get the once per month SD ppm x 5 times a week I'd like to do so we both build up resentment. It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

And yes update means the same as date up, a/k/a dating out of one's league. \n\n\\[Earth Angel - Marvin Berry & The Starlighters\\]\\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41GsS3jldOI\\]\n\nMany guys will intentionally down date just so they don't become emotionally involved. I remember my best friend telling me about that when we were going through our divorces. We were both at the point where we had completely given up on trying to make the marriages work and we used to just hang having coffee and dessert after dinner or an event or else just having a couple of drinks watching a game. We always talked about any girls we had met of course and the banter was always the same. I'd tell him about some girl I met that I found intellectually stimulating and he would berate me, saying, \"why would you want someone with a brain? she's just going to become a problem. For me, I just want to have a few laughs, have a little fun, get laid and that's it.\"\n\nSo, Sugar Down Dating achieves that. It's sad because the woman in that position can become deluded and think she's really caught a big fish when in fact it's purely sport fishing for catch and release. That can be pretty emotionally devastating if the girl doesn't realize what's happening.",

Plenty of people marry their SBs and are in love with their SBs so it's not prohibitive or limiting in any way romantically.\n\nIn fact many older generations actually were sugar relationships by default. The men provided for women by default, even if these women were their wives, but these older generations didn't think it's not love. So why do you think it's not love in this generation? Did the meaning of love change to 50/50 in the last few decades or what?\n\nIf these men want to convert their SB into vanilla in my opinion the way to do it is to upgrade her financially to the point where money is no longer a concern for her like it's no longer a concern for you. If you're not able to put her in that position because you're simply not rich enough then you're being a SD when you can't actually afford to do it long term and this is why so many want to back out. They simply can't afford to go all the way and upgrade her to their social status but they also can't afford to keep paying her bills either.\n\nSo if you can't provide at all, if you can't contribute financially at all, then you cannot afford to be a SD and maybe should do what vanilla guys do which is find a live in GF who can help pay half of the rent. Rent is very high in SF so a lot of guys there probably can't even afford to pay their own rent and need a GF to help them but thats one of the problems with vanilla. Many are vanilla because they cannot afford to survive on their own.\n\nTo the multi millionaire tech CEO SDs I can't say I have the same sympathy for. Those types who are socially awkward nerds who have lots of money, who go on Seeking and finally find a woman who is physically attractive to their standard, but then want to go 50/50 after the fact?

If you're not able to put her in that position because you're simply not rich enough then you're being a SD when you can't actually afford to do it long term and this is why so many want to back out. They simply can't afford to go all the way and upgrade her to their social status but they also can't afford to keep paying her bills either.\n\nExactly. It's far more difficult. Which is why actual SDs have a premium. It's incredibly rare for a woman to be able to find a man who can provide a better life for her here in America. If she's overseas then it's a lot easier because a lot of Americans with regular jobs can provide her with a better life but an American with an American it's exceptionally rare. In other words it's harder today in 2023 for women to be socially mobile than it was in previous generations.  \n\n\nWomen have more equality now to work but the social mobility is less because most wealth transfer for women happens through marriage not through a job. Very few women are successful entrepreneurs. So what you end up with is a lot of women struggling economically their entire life with a man who struggles with them (struggle love) and  (50/50). As a SD we can provide a first class lifestyle but it comes at the cost of an age gap.  \n\n\n\"The biggest problem I have with looking for love within an SD/SB relationship is that emotions can make a person more vulnerable to manipulation and abuse from the other party. \"  \n\n\nManipulation takes place just as much in vanilla relationships. If you're dating a narcissist or sociopath you'll be manipulated whether she's calling herself your SB or your GF or your WIFE. JD and AH for example, AH married him, and was she an SB? Was that vanilla? Does it matter when looking at the outcome?  \n\n\n\" Too many people within these spaces are just looking for their own gains and will gladly manipulate someone that is vulnerable. I prefer people find love through their social group, professional events(so that they can have common goals) and any other means that is not built on money\"  \n\n\nSo how can a woman go from a family that is in generational poverty to being a family that has generational wealth? She can hit the lottery. She can be a genius entrepreneur. Or she can marry her SD. But do you also recognize that women some of whom have kids which they acquired from a vanilla relationship, are not struggling in poverty and likely will remain in poverty for their lifetime unless they make some sacrifices?  \n\n\nSingle mothers don't have to become SBs. She can work two jobs. She can start her own business. But if she finds a rich man who can provide for her and her kids for life, why would it be rational for her to choose to struggle for life instead? The economy is ruthless.",

The reason why our standard of living has gone down is in part because women choose to enter the work place in mass and that lead to wages becoming stagnant since now we have double the employee pool. Love cannot be based on money alone, if that\u2019s the case than any man will always have to be concerned that the woman he is wait could find someone with more money. The transactional nature of relationships you want is not something that can last because peoples fortunes can change at any moment. Women can choose to build a business with their husbands, get into high paying professions and invest their income etc to get out of poverty. I think we can both agree that building businesses and getting into high paying fields has a far higher success rate than looking for a 1% man to lift you into wealth all of a sudden. The relationships you describe as a man just being the provider tends to fail in many cases because the money will slow down and divorce will be right around the corner as is the case with many pro athletes who retire",

Let him give the allowance first (forget PPM) and think of the allowance as a way to free up your time to exclusively focus on dating him. The way I think about it is if I know most people have to work a 9-5, and I want more time with that person or that person to adjust their life around my schedule, I'll have to free up their time and that costs money.  \n\n\nIt's about time not sex. Sex can enter the picture later but in my opinion it can come after it's established that the person is someone I like spending time and doing non-sexual things with.  If a SD starts out with an allowance he should be able to budget in such a way that he can afford to pay that allowance for 6 months to a year before trying to convert it into some kind of vanilla relationship. Also sometimes it's never supposed to be a vanilla relationship.  \n\n\nI don't know what things are like in SF in particular but isn't that a place where a lot of tech CEOs live? These guys are making millions of dollars? They can afford an allowance if what you're asking for is reasonable. So what would be the actual motivation of trying to save a few bucks by pressuring women to go 50/50 financially when you're a multi millionaire? Unless she's a multi-millionaire too I wouldn't even bother asking for something like that.  \n\n\nIf multiple SDs are backing out from the arrangement maybe your financial needs are just too high? Maybe ask for less and see if he'll go for that. If it's not that then he's just not feeling you.",

Some SBs want something reasonable like rent money while others want to demand more than is reasonable. SBs of quality aren't rinsers but I agree with you that if the SD doesn't know if she's of quality he's going to hesitate. Rent money in a lot of places isn't all that much for a multi millionaire so if her company is good enough it can work.  \n\n\nHow long can things stay like that? It's like vanilla dating or any other kind of dating. Some guys want to have sex on the first date. I'm not one of those guys so my tips go for people who like a feeling out process and it could take a few weeks and several dates to learn what you need to learn. So while you're expecting her to take time from her schedule while you date her trying to figure out if it can work don't you think you should handle that bill?   \n\n\nYes some women will scam, go on multiple dates knowing they have no interest in the man, knowing they are leading him on just to rinse him. But the average woman isn't having sex on the first or even the second date, and can take weeks, and so why rush? If you're going to have sex at least do it from a position where you're both comfortable with it and a reasonable allowance isn't a big deal if the SB isn't scamming. Scamming ruins sugaring for everyone who is honest because no one wants to lose even a single dollar to a scammer but in general dating has some level of risk built in where you could find out in the process that you really don't match well with her sexually or emotionally, after having gone on multiple dates, so what can you do?  \n\n\nWhat I said still applies to me. I need to establish that I like the person before I would care to have sex with the person. If I like the person enough I'll take the risk on allowance because at least I'd like her company and the dates are fun. I doubt most rinsers are going to stick around going on dates pretending to enjoy themselves for weeks just to get an allowance but you never know.",

Another scenario is you could be the SD afraid to give allowance early on while I'd give allowance early on. You could miss out on a top tier SB because you were too paranoid to risk being rinsed while another SD doesn't mind gambling $$$$ that first week to find out if she's worth $$$$ the second week and so on.

These are women you wouldn't want to date or even be friends with in a vanilla context so they sugar date because they aren't top tier.

Lol. Maybe it\u2019s worked for you in the past, congrats. But it\u2019s still terrible general advice for most men.\n\nI never said 30 min coffee dates. You said that. I said free up her time and then you can spend 3 hours or 6 hours with her because she can take a day off work. She can't do that if you don't pay allowance, and so you'll have only 30 minutes while the other SD has 3 or 6 hours. Just pay the allowance after that 30 minute coffee meeting or don't. You can always get scammed or rinsed so you can break it up by weeks.\n\nThe valid question you asked is how can a SD know a SB is top tier. You can never know 100% but the more time you have with a SB the easier it is to find out. The allowance at least in the beginning is a way to find out and get to know her as a person without her job or bills or commitments getting in the way.",

What I've been finding is I'm being approached on even non-dating sites and after talking for a while have been asked for money, even before a date! It's happened here as well a few times when I've been DM'd (on Reddit where I don't even see a profile, description or picture!) and eventually asked for money long distance with sometimes not even the pretense of being interested in me. Just a plea for help.\n\nA few other times I've started seeing someone that I met in a totally vanilla way who asked for an allowance after a few dates. Like out of the clear blue. Or sometimes in text messages before meeting, like in a seemingly nonchalant sort of way, \"Oh, btw, would you mind....\" I get the feeling this is because the idea of an eventual 'serious' relationship is not even being considered as a possibility.\n\nI go shopping at the supermarket on Sundays and there's always a guy sitting on the sidewalk with a cup in his hand. I usually give him a $5 every time I see him. He's sitting there because it's a good spot to collect and so maybe is Reddit and other sites where there are guys already in the thought mode of giving money to a woman.  \n\nI have ex-GFs I'm still platonic friends with who dabble in sugaring. They are also looking for vanilla dates. One found she can help her finances by banging her plug lol and her live-in BF benefits thereby as well, lol. Others are finding there is such a tsunami of SBs now, the competition has gotten horrible for any but the very most desirable. \n\nSo, why is this happening? Sex is now an accepted commodity. The shame is gone; the stigma is gone and asking for money. I think there's a problem looking for a solution in this on both sides of the equation and the advent of sugaring and poly and kink in overlapping social circles has made it all very acceptable. \n\nThe men are looking for access to the best women they can get and that usually means qualities other than money. Women are of course also looking for other qualities in a guy, but the primary focus of sugaring is money. For many, it is actually a job - and the distinction between full time, part time and occasional is kind of meaningless. \n\nBack to the OP, the motivations of men vs women in this are naturally opposing forces. It's just as logical for a woman to try to increase allowance as it is for a guy to try to decrease it.",

The 3rd younger one said he didn\u2019t have luck on other dating sites and used SA as a \u201cfoot in door\u201d strategy. 4th one was actually 20 years older than me. He\u2019s established, well-off, would randomly send me more than the PPM $ on days we didn\u2019t see each other just so my day would be better.. but he randomly suggested going vanilla and spoiling me w gifts instead.. which would add up to the value or more than the PPM which didn\u2019t really make sense to me",

Shouldn't it be assumed that hey somewhat good looking SD only 6 year's older is able to afford to be a SD? I'm in my Early 40s now but I have been doing this for a decade and I do run into some women now and then who get into some high ppm mindset and they only expect to meet once a month or something. It doesn't work out for me because they assume if they get the once per month SD ppm x 5 times a week I'd like to do so we both build up resentment. It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

He would be on the hook financially if you and him were ever to be committed and certainly if ever married.

One reason is that without the money, they would never be able to get with women of that hi quality. So the cash allows them to update and then they fall. There's an old saying:\n\n\"A man chases a woman until he's caught.\"",

And yes update means the same as date up, a/k/a dating out of one's league. \n\n\\[Earth Angel - Marvin Berry & The Starlighters\\]\\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41GsS3jldOI\\]\n\nMany guys will intentionally down date just so they don't become emotionally involved. I remember my best friend telling me about that when we were going through our divorces. We were both at the point where we had completely given up on trying to make the marriages work and we used to just hang having coffee and dessert after dinner or an event or else just having a couple of drinks watching a game. We always talked about any girls we had met of course and the banter was always the same. I'd tell him about some girl I met that I found intellectually stimulating and he would berate me, saying, \"why would you want someone with a brain? she's just going to become a problem. For me, I just want to have a few laughs, have a little fun, get laid and that's it.\"\n\nSo, Sugar Down Dating achieves that. It's sad because the woman in that position can become deluded and think she's really caught a big fish when in fact it's purely sport fishing for catch and release. That can be pretty emotionally devastating if the girl doesn't realize what's happening.",

Plenty of people marry their SBs and are in love with their SBs so it's not prohibitive or limiting in any way romantically.\n\nIn fact many older generations actually were sugar relationships by default. The men provided for women by default, even if these women were their wives, but these older generations didn't think it's not love. So why do you think it's not love in this generation? Did the meaning of love change to 50/50 in the last few decades or what?\n\nIf these men want to convert their SB into vanilla in my opinion the way to do it is to upgrade her financially to the point where money is no longer a concern for her like it's no longer a concern for you. If you're not able to put her in that position because you're simply not rich enough then you're being a SD when you can't actually afford to do it long term and this is why so many want to back out. They simply can't afford to go all the way and upgrade her to their social status but they also can't afford to keep paying her bills either.\n\nSo if you can't provide at all, if you can't contribute financially at all, then you cannot afford to be a SD and maybe should do what vanilla guys do which is find a live in GF who can help pay half of the rent. Rent is very high in SF so a lot of guys there probably can't even afford to pay their own rent and need a GF to help them but thats one of the problems with vanilla. Many are vanilla because they cannot afford to survive on their own.\n\nTo the multi millionaire tech CEO SDs I can't say I have the same sympathy for. Those types who are socially awkward nerds who have lots of money, who go on Seeking and finally find a woman who is physically attractive to their standard, but then want to go 50/50 after the fact?

They simply can't afford to go all the way and upgrade her to their social status but they also can't afford to keep paying her bills either.\n\nExactly. It's far more difficult. Which is why actual SDs have a premium. It's incredibly rare for a woman to be able to find a man who can provide a better life for her here in America. If she's overseas then it's a lot easier because a lot of Americans with regular jobs can provide her with a better life but an American with an American it's exceptionally rare. In other words it's harder today in 2023 for women to be socially mobile than it was in previous generations.  \n\n\nWomen have more equality now to work but the social mobility is less because most wealth transfer for women happens through marriage not through a job. Very few women are successful entrepreneurs. So what you end up with is a lot of women struggling economically their entire life with a man who struggles with them (struggle love) and  (50/50). As a SD we can provide a first class lifestyle but it comes at the cost of an age gap.  \n\n\n\"The biggest problem I have with looking for love within an SD/SB relationship is that emotions can make a person more vulnerable to manipulation and abuse from the other party. \"  \n\n\nManipulation takes place just as much in vanilla relationships. If you're dating a narcissist or sociopath you'll be manipulated whether she's calling herself your SB or your GF or your WIFE. JD and AH for example, AH married him, and was she an SB? Was that vanilla? Does it matter when looking at the outcome?  \n\n\n\" Too many people within these spaces are just looking for their own gains and will gladly manipulate someone that is vulnerable. I prefer people find love through their social group, professional events(so that they can have common goals) and any other means that is not built on money\"  \n\n\nSo how can a woman go from a family that is in generational poverty to being a family that has generational wealth? She can hit the lottery. She can be a genius entrepreneur. Or she can marry her SD. But do you also recognize that women some of whom have kids which they acquired from a vanilla relationship, are not struggling in poverty and likely will remain in poverty for their lifetime unless they make some sacrifices?  \n\n\nSingle mothers don't have to become SBs. She can work two jobs. She can start her own business. But if she finds a rich man who can provide for her and her kids for life, why would it be rational for her to choose to struggle for life instead? The economy is ruthless.",

The reason why our standard of living has gone down is in part because women choose to enter the work place in mass and that lead to wages becoming stagnant since now we have double the employee pool. Love cannot be based on money alone, if that\u2019s the case than any man will always have to be concerned that the woman he is wait could find someone with more money. The transactional nature of relationships you want is not something that can last because peoples fortunes can change at any moment. Women can choose to build a business with their husbands, get into high paying professions and invest their income etc to get out of poverty. I think we can both agree that building businesses and getting into high paying fields has a far higher success rate than looking for a 1% man to lift you into wealth all of a sudden. The relationships you describe as a man just being the provider tends to fail in many cases because the money will slow down and divorce will be right around the corner as is the case with many pro athletes who retire",

Some SBs want something reasonable like rent money while others want to demand more than is reasonable. SBs of quality aren't rinsers but I agree with you that if the SD doesn't know if she's of quality he's going to hesitate. Rent money in a lot of places isn't all that much for a multi millionaire so if her company is good enough it can work.  \n\n\nHow long can things stay like that? It's like vanilla dating or any other kind of dating. Some guys want to have sex on the first date. I'm not one of those guys so my tips go for people who like a feeling out process and it could take a few weeks and several dates to learn what you need to learn. So while you're expecting her to take time from her schedule while you date her trying to figure out if it can work don't you think you should handle that bill?   \n\n\nYes some women will scam, go on multiple dates knowing they have no interest in the man, knowing they are leading him on just to rinse him. But the average woman isn't having sex on the first or even the second date, and can take weeks, and so why rush? If you're going to have sex at least do it from a position where you're both comfortable with it and a reasonable allowance isn't a big deal if the SB isn't scamming. Scamming ruins sugaring for everyone who is honest because no one wants to lose even a single dollar to a scammer but in general dating has some level of risk built in where you could find out in the process that you really don't match well with her sexually or emotionally, after having gone on multiple dates, so what can you do?  \n\n\nWhat I said still applies to me. I need to establish that I like the person before I would care to have sex with the person. If I like the person enough I'll take the risk on allowance because at least I'd like her company and the dates are fun. I doubt most rinsers are going to stick around going on dates pretending to enjoy themselves for weeks just to get an allowance but you never know.",

How do you know she'd make a good companion before you've gone on a few dates at least? How do you tell her to go on dates and focus on you and not focus on getting money if you're afraid to give an allowance?\n\nRinsing is one scenario. Another scenario is you could be the SD afraid to give allowance early on while I'd give allowance early on. You could miss out on a top tier SB because you were too paranoid to risk being rinsed while another SD doesn't mind gambling $$$$ that first week to find out if she's worth $$$$ the second week and so on. But if you don't give allowance well you're expecting her to spend a lot of time with you when she could be working earning that $$$$.",

If the SD \u201cmisses out\u201d, then they save their money for other SBs or other activities.\n\nThe idea that an SD has to provide an allowance up front to a potential rinser so they don\u2019t \u201cmiss out\u201d, comes from an insecure scarcity mindset. Recommending that SDs approach the bowl with such a scarcity mindset, is dogg sh*t advice. This isn\u2019t Tinder. If an SB isn\u2019t interested, then move on to the next.

I said free up her time and then you can spend 3 hours or 6 hours with her because she can take a day off work. She can't do that if you don't pay allowance, and so you'll have only 30 minutes while the other SD has 3 or 6 hours. Just pay the allowance after that 30 minute coffee meeting or don't. You can always get scammed or rinsed so you can break it up by weeks.\n\nThe valid question you asked is how can a SD know a SB is top tier. You can never know 100% but the more time you have with a SB the easier it is to find out. The allowance at least in the beginning is a way to find out and get to know her as a person without her job or bills or commitments getting in the way.",

What I've been finding is I'm being approached on even non-dating sites and after talking for a while have been asked for money, even before a date! It's happened here as well a few times when I've been DM'd (on Reddit where I don't even see a profile, description or picture!) and eventually asked for money long distance with sometimes not even the pretense of being interested in me. Just a plea for help.\n\nA few other times I've started seeing someone that I met in a totally vanilla way who asked for an allowance after a few dates. Like out of the clear blue. Or sometimes in text messages before meeting, like in a seemingly nonchalant sort of way, \"Oh, btw, would you mind....\" I get the feeling this is because the idea of an eventual 'serious' relationship is not even being considered as a possibility.\n\nI go shopping at the supermarket on Sundays and there's always a guy sitting on the sidewalk with a cup in his hand. I usually give him a $5 every time I see him. He's sitting there because it's a good spot to collect and so maybe is Reddit and other sites where there are guys already in the thought mode of giving money to a woman.  \n\nI have ex-GFs I'm still platonic friends with who dabble in sugaring. They are also looking for vanilla dates. One found she can help her finances by banging her plug lol and her live-in BF benefits thereby as well, lol. Others are finding there is such a tsunami of SBs now, the competition has gotten horrible for any but the very most desirable. \n\nSo, why is this happening? Sex is now an accepted commodity. The shame is gone; the stigma is gone and asking for money. I think there's a problem looking for a solution in this on both sides of the equation and the advent of sugaring and poly and kink in overlapping social circles has made it all very acceptable. \n\nThe men are looking for access to the best women they can get and that usually means qualities other than money. Women are of course also looking for other qualities in a guy, but the primary focus of sugaring is money. For many, it is actually a job - and the distinction between full time, part time and occasional is kind of meaningless. \n\nBack to the OP, the motivations of men vs women in this are naturally opposing forces. It's just as logical for a woman to try to increase allowance as it is for a guy to try to decrease it.",

Shouldn't it be assumed that hey somewhat good looking SD only 6 year's older is able to afford to be a SD? I'm in my Early 40s now but I have been doing this for a decade and I do run into some women now and then who get into some high ppm mindset and they only expect to meet once a month or something. It doesn't work out for me because they assume if they get the once per month SD ppm x 5 times a week I'd like to do so we both build up resentment. It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

And yes update means the same as date up, a/k/a dating out of one's league. \n\n\\[Earth Angel - Marvin Berry & The Starlighters\\]\\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41GsS3jldOI\\]\n\nMany guys will intentionally down date just so they don't become emotionally involved. I remember my best friend telling me about that when we were going through our divorces. We were both at the point where we had completely given up on trying to make the marriages work and we used to just hang having coffee and dessert after dinner or an event or else just having a couple of drinks watching a game. We always talked about any girls we had met of course and the banter was always the same. I'd tell him about some girl I met that I found intellectually stimulating and he would berate me, saying, \"why would you want someone with a brain? she's just going to become a problem. For me, I just want to have a few laughs, have a little fun, get laid and that's it.\"\n\nSo, Sugar Down Dating achieves that. It's sad because the woman in that position can become deluded and think she's really caught a big fish when in fact it's purely sport fishing for catch and release. That can be pretty emotionally devastating if the girl doesn't realize what's happening.",

If you're not able to put her in that position because you're simply not rich enough then you're being a SD when you can't actually afford to do it long term and this is why so many want to back out. They simply can't afford to go all the way and upgrade her to their social status but they also can't afford to keep paying her bills either.\n\nExactly. It's far more difficult. Which is why actual SDs have a premium. It's incredibly rare for a woman to be able to find a man who can provide a better life for her here in America. If she's overseas then it's a lot easier because a lot of Americans with regular jobs can provide her with a better life but an American with an American it's exceptionally rare. In other words it's harder today in 2023 for women to be socially mobile than it was in previous generations.  \n\n\nWomen have more equality now to work but the social mobility is less because most wealth transfer for women happens through marriage not through a job. Very few women are successful entrepreneurs. So what you end up with is a lot of women struggling economically their entire life with a man who struggles with them (struggle love) and  (50/50). As a SD we can provide a first class lifestyle but it comes at the cost of an age gap.  \n\n\n\"The biggest problem I have with looking for love within an SD/SB relationship is that emotions can make a person more vulnerable to manipulation and abuse from the other party. \"  \n\n\nManipulation takes place just as much in vanilla relationships. If you're dating a narcissist or sociopath you'll be manipulated whether she's calling herself your SB or your GF or your WIFE. JD and AH for example, AH married him, and was she an SB? Was that vanilla? Does it matter when looking at the outcome?  \n\n\n\" Too many people within these spaces are just looking for their own gains and will gladly manipulate someone that is vulnerable. I prefer people find love through their social group, professional events(so that they can have common goals) and any other means that is not built on money\"  \n\n\nSo how can a woman go from a family that is in generational poverty to being a family that has generational wealth? She can hit the lottery. She can be a genius entrepreneur. Or she can marry her SD. But do you also recognize that women some of whom have kids which they acquired from a vanilla relationship, are not struggling in poverty and likely will remain in poverty for their lifetime unless they make some sacrifices?  \n\n\nSingle mothers don't have to become SBs. She can work two jobs. She can start her own business. But if she finds a rich man who can provide for her and her kids for life, why would it be rational for her to choose to struggle for life instead? The economy is ruthless.",

Love cannot be based on money alone, if that\u2019s the case than any man will always have to be concerned that the woman he is wait could find someone with more money. The transactional nature of relationships you want is not something that can last because peoples fortunes can change at any moment. Women can choose to build a business with their husbands, get into high paying professions and invest their income etc to get out of poverty. I think we can both agree that building businesses and getting into high paying fields has a far higher success rate than looking for a 1% man to lift you into wealth all of a sudden. The relationships you describe as a man just being the provider tends to fail in many cases because the money will slow down and divorce will be right around the corner as is the case with many pro athletes who retire",

Some SBs want something reasonable like rent money while others want to demand more than is reasonable. SBs of quality aren't rinsers but I agree with you that if the SD doesn't know if she's of quality he's going to hesitate. Rent money in a lot of places isn't all that much for a multi millionaire so if her company is good enough it can work.  \n\n\nHow long can things stay like that? It's like vanilla dating or any other kind of dating. Some guys want to have sex on the first date. I'm not one of those guys so my tips go for people who like a feeling out process and it could take a few weeks and several dates to learn what you need to learn. So while you're expecting her to take time from her schedule while you date her trying to figure out if it can work don't you think you should handle that bill?   \n\n\nYes some women will scam, go on multiple dates knowing they have no interest in the man, knowing they are leading him on just to rinse him. But the average woman isn't having sex on the first or even the second date, and can take weeks, and so why rush? If you're going to have sex at least do it from a position where you're both comfortable with it and a reasonable allowance isn't a big deal if the SB isn't scamming. Scamming ruins sugaring for everyone who is honest because no one wants to lose even a single dollar to a scammer but in general dating has some level of risk built in where you could find out in the process that you really don't match well with her sexually or emotionally, after having gone on multiple dates, so what can you do?  \n\n\nWhat I said still applies to me. I need to establish that I like the person before I would care to have sex with the person. If I like the person enough I'll take the risk on allowance because at least I'd like her company and the dates are fun. I doubt most rinsers are going to stick around going on dates pretending to enjoy themselves for weeks just to get an allowance but you never know.",

You could miss out on a top tier SB because you were too paranoid to risk being rinsed while another SD doesn't mind gambling $$$$ that first week to find out if she's worth $$$$ the second week and so on. But if you don't give allowance well you're expecting her to spend a lot of time with you when she could be working earning that $$$$.",

I said free up her time and then you can spend 3 hours or 6 hours with her because she can take a day off work. She can't do that if you don't pay allowance, and so you'll have only 30 minutes while the other SD has 3 or 6 hours. Just pay the allowance after that 30 minute coffee meeting or don't. You can always get scammed or rinsed so you can break it up by weeks.\n\nThe valid question you asked is how can a SD know a SB is top tier. You can never know 100% but the more time you have with a SB the easier it is to find out. The allowance at least in the beginning is a way to find out and get to know her as a person without her job or bills or commitments getting in the way.",

            "body": "Blur. You got that right. What I've been finding is I'm being approached on even non-dating sites and after talking for a while have been asked for money, even before a date! It's happened here as well a few times when I've been DM'd (on Reddit where I don't even see a profile, description or picture!) and eventually asked for money long distance with sometimes not even the pretense of being interested in me. Just a plea for help.\n\nA few other times I've started seeing someone that I met in a totally vanilla way who asked for an allowance after a few dates. Like out of the clear blue. Or sometimes in text messages before meeting, like in a seemingly nonchalant sort of way, \"Oh, btw, would you mind....\" I get the feeling this is because the idea of an eventual 'serious' relationship is not even being considered as a possibility.\n\nI go shopping at the supermarket on Sundays and there's always a guy sitting on the sidewalk with a cup in his hand. I usually give him a $5 every time I see him. He's sitting there because it's a good spot to collect and so maybe is Reddit and other sites where there are guys already in the thought mode of giving money to a woman.  \n\nI have ex-GFs I'm still platonic friends with who dabble in sugaring. They are also looking for vanilla dates. One found she can help her finances by banging her plug lol and her live-in BF benefits thereby as well, lol. Others are finding there is such a tsunami of SBs now, the competition has gotten horrible for any but the very most desirable. \n\nSo, why is this happening? Sex is now an accepted commodity. The shame is gone; the stigma is gone and asking for money. I think there's a problem looking for a solution in this on both sides of the equation and the advent of sugaring and poly and kink in overlapping social circles has made it all very acceptable. \n\nThe men are looking for access to the best women they can get and that usually means qualities other than money. Women are of course also looking for other qualities in a guy, but the primary focus of sugaring is money. For many, it is actually a job - and the distinction between full time, part time and occasional is kind of meaningless. \n\nBack to the OP, the motivations of men vs women in this are naturally opposing forces. It's just as logical for a woman to try to increase allowance as it is for a guy to try to decrease it.",

Shouldn't it be assumed that hey somewhat good looking SD only 6 year's older is able to afford to be a SD? I'm in my Early 40s now but I have been doing this for a decade and I do run into some women now and then who get into some high ppm mindset and they only expect to meet once a month or something. It doesn't work out for me because they assume if they get the once per month SD ppm x 5 times a week I'd like to do so we both build up resentment. It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

I remember my best friend telling me about that when we were going through our divorces. We were both at the point where we had completely given up on trying to make the marriages work and we used to just hang having coffee and dessert after dinner or an event or else just having a couple of drinks watching a game. We always talked about any girls we had met of course and the banter was always the same. I'd tell him about some girl I met that I found intellectually stimulating and he would berate me, saying, \"why would you want someone with a brain? she's just going to become a problem. For me, I just want to have a few laughs, have a little fun, get laid and that's it.\"\n\nSo, Sugar Down Dating achieves that. It's sad because the woman in that position can become deluded and think she's really caught a big fish when in fact it's purely sport fishing for catch and release. That can be pretty emotionally devastating if the girl doesn't realize what's happening.",

If you're not able to put her in that position because you're simply not rich enough then you're being a SD when you can't actually afford to do it long term and this is why so many want to back out. They simply can't afford to go all the way and upgrade her to their social status but they also can't afford to keep paying her bills either.\n\nExactly. It's far more difficult. Which is why actual SDs have a premium. It's incredibly rare for a woman to be able to find a man who can provide a better life for her here in America. If she's overseas then it's a lot easier because a lot of Americans with regular jobs can provide her with a better life but an American with an American it's exceptionally rare. In other words it's harder today in 2023 for women to be socially mobile than it was in previous generations.  \n\n\nWomen have more equality now to work but the social mobility is less because most wealth transfer for women happens through marriage not through a job. Very few women are successful entrepreneurs. So what you end up with is a lot of women struggling economically their entire life with a man who struggles with them (struggle love) and  (50/50). As a SD we can provide a first class lifestyle but it comes at the cost of an age gap.  \n\n\n\"The biggest problem I have with looking for love within an SD/SB relationship is that emotions can make a person more vulnerable to manipulation and abuse from the other party. \"  \n\n\nManipulation takes place just as much in vanilla relationships. If you're dating a narcissist or sociopath you'll be manipulated whether she's calling herself your SB or your GF or your WIFE. JD and AH for example, AH married him, and was she an SB? Was that vanilla? Does it matter when looking at the outcome?  \n\n\n\" Too many people within these spaces are just looking for their own gains and will gladly manipulate someone that is vulnerable. I prefer people find love through their social group, professional events(so that they can have common goals) and any other means that is not built on money\"  \n\n\nSo how can a woman go from a family that is in generational poverty to being a family that has generational wealth? She can hit the lottery. She can be a genius entrepreneur. Or she can marry her SD. But do you also recognize that women some of whom have kids which they acquired from a vanilla relationship, are not struggling in poverty and likely will remain in poverty for their lifetime unless they make some sacrifices?  \n\n\nSingle mothers don't have to become SBs. She can work two jobs. She can start her own business. But if she finds a rich man who can provide for her and her kids for life, why would it be rational for her to choose to struggle for life instead? The economy is ruthless.",

The reason why our standard of living has gone down is in part because women choose to enter the work place in mass and that lead to wages becoming stagnant since now we have double the employee pool. Love cannot be based on money alone, if that\u2019s the case than any man will always have to be concerned that the woman he is wait could find someone with more money. The transactional nature of relationships you want is not something that can last because peoples fortunes can change at any moment. Women can choose to build a business with their husbands, get into high paying professions and invest their income etc to get out of poverty. I think we can both agree that building businesses and getting into high paying fields has a far higher success rate than looking for a 1% man to lift you into wealth all of a sudden. The relationships you describe as a man just being the provider tends to fail in many cases because the money will slow down and divorce will be right around the corner as is the case with many pro athletes who retire",

Of course not.\"\n\nI'm not advocating money for sex. Money is initially to free up her time. How do you know you want to have sex with someone before you've spent any time with her? How do you know she'd make a good companion before you've gone on a few dates at least? How do you tell her to go on dates and focus on you and not focus on getting money if you're afraid to give an allowance?\n\nRinsing is one scenario. Another scenario is you could be the SD afraid to give allowance early on while I'd give allowance early on. You could miss out on a top tier SB because you were too paranoid to risk being rinsed while another SD doesn't mind gambling $$$$ that first week to find out if she's worth $$$$ the second week and so on. But if you don't give allowance well you're expecting her to spend a lot of time with you when she could be working earning that $$$$.",

Maybe it\u2019s worked for you in the past, congrats. But it\u2019s still terrible general advice for most men.\n\nI never said 30 min coffee dates. You said that. I said free up her time and then you can spend 3 hours or 6 hours with her because she can take a day off work. She can't do that if you don't pay allowance, and so you'll have only 30 minutes while the other SD has 3 or 6 hours. Just pay the allowance after that 30 minute coffee meeting or don't. You can always get scammed or rinsed so you can break it up by weeks.\n\nThe valid question you asked is how can a SD know a SB is top tier. You can never know 100% but the more time you have with a SB the easier it is to find out. The allowance at least in the beginning is a way to find out and get to know her as a person without her job or bills or commitments getting in the way.",

Shouldn't it be assumed that hey somewhat good looking SD only 6 year's older is able to afford to be a SD? I'm in my Early 40s now but I have been doing this for a decade and I do run into some women now and then who get into some high ppm mindset and they only expect to meet once a month or something. It doesn't work out for me because they assume if they get the once per month SD ppm x 5 times a week I'd like to do so we both build up resentment. It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

I remember my best friend telling me about that when we were going through our divorces. We were both at the point where we had completely given up on trying to make the marriages work and we used to just hang having coffee and dessert after dinner or an event or else just having a couple of drinks watching a game. We always talked about any girls we had met of course and the banter was always the same. I'd tell him about some girl I met that I found intellectually stimulating and he would berate me, saying, \"why would you want someone with a brain? she's just going to become a problem. For me, I just want to have a few laughs, have a little fun, get laid and that's it.\"\n\nSo, Sugar Down Dating achieves that. It's sad because the woman in that position can become deluded and think she's really caught a big fish when in fact it's purely sport fishing for catch and release. That can be pretty emotionally devastating if the girl doesn't realize what's happening.",

The reason why our standard of living has gone down is in part because women choose to enter the work place in mass and that lead to wages becoming stagnant since now we have double the employee pool. Love cannot be based on money alone, if that\u2019s the case than any man will always have to be concerned that the woman he is wait could find someone with more money. The transactional nature of relationships you want is not something that can last because peoples fortunes can change at any moment. Women can choose to build a business with their husbands, get into high paying professions and invest their income etc to get out of poverty. I think we can both agree that building businesses and getting into high paying fields has a far higher success rate than looking for a 1% man to lift you into wealth all of a sudden. The relationships you describe as a man just being the provider tends to fail in many cases because the money will slow down and divorce will be right around the corner as is the case with many pro athletes who retire",

You could lose.\n\n\"Would you advice an SB to give up sex, time, companionship etc right away, in hopes that the SD would provide an allowance later on? Of course not.\"\n\nI'm not advocating money for sex. Money is initially to free up her time. How do you know you want to have sex with someone before you've spent any time with her? How do you know she'd make a good companion before you've gone on a few dates at least? How do you tell her to go on dates and focus on you and not focus on getting money if you're afraid to give an allowance?\n\nRinsing is one scenario. Another scenario is you could be the SD afraid to give allowance early on while I'd give allowance early on. You could miss out on a top tier SB because you were too paranoid to risk being rinsed while another SD doesn't mind gambling $$$$ that first week to find out if she's worth $$$$ the second week and so on.

A lot of the kind of SBs I see other SDs complaining about (scammers and mercenaries) aren't top tier. These are women you wouldn't want to date or even be friends with in a vanilla context so they sugar date because they aren't top tier. Top tier SBs choose top tier SDs and it's not a sign that you're top tier if you're worried about losing some tiny amount of money so much that you're not going to make a move.  \n\n\nPut simple it's all about her character.

Maybe it\u2019s worked for you in the past, congrats. But it\u2019s still terrible general advice for most men.\n\nI never said 30 min coffee dates. You said that. I said free up her time and then you can spend 3 hours or 6 hours with her because she can take a day off work. She can't do that if you don't pay allowance, and so you'll have only 30 minutes while the other SD has 3 or 6 hours. Just pay the allowance after that 30 minute coffee meeting or don't. You can always get scammed or rinsed so you can break it up by weeks.\n\nThe valid question you asked is how can a SD know a SB is top tier. You can never know 100% but the more time you have with a SB the easier it is to find out. The allowance at least in the beginning is a way to find out and get to know her as a person without her job or bills or commitments getting in the way.",

Shouldn't it be assumed that hey somewhat good looking SD only 6 year's older is able to afford to be a SD? I'm in my Early 40s now but I have been doing this for a decade and I do run into some women now and then who get into some high ppm mindset and they only expect to meet once a month or something. It doesn't work out for me because they assume if they get the once per month SD ppm x 5 times a week I'd like to do so we both build up resentment. It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

And yes update means the same as date up, a/k/a dating out of one's league. \n\n\\[Earth Angel - Marvin Berry & The Starlighters\\]\\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41GsS3jldOI\\]\n\nMany guys will intentionally down date just so they don't become emotionally involved. I remember my best friend telling me about that when we were going through our divorces. We were both at the point where we had completely given up on trying to make the marriages work and we used to just hang having coffee and dessert after dinner or an event or else just having a couple of drinks watching a game. We always talked about any girls we had met of course and the banter was always the same. I'd tell him about some girl I met that I found intellectually stimulating and he would berate me, saying, \"why would you want someone with a brain? she's just going to become a problem. For me, I just want to have a few laughs, have a little fun, get laid and that's it.\"\n\nSo, Sugar Down Dating achieves that. It's sad because the woman in that position can become deluded and think she's really caught a big fish when in fact it's purely sport fishing for catch and release. That can be pretty emotionally devastating if the girl doesn't realize what's happening.",

It's a tricky dance but whatever works for people I prefer longer term and try to minimize STDs, because a beautiful woman can be someone's dream girl for the night everyday even if they can only afford to see her once a month.",

A lot of the kind of SBs I see other SDs complaining about (scammers and mercenaries) aren't top tier. These are women you wouldn't want to date or even be friends with in a vanilla context so they sugar date because they aren't top tier. Top tier SBs choose top tier SDs and it's not a sign that you're top tier if you're worried about losing some tiny amount of money so much that you're not going to make a move.  \n\n\nPut simple it's all about her character.
