I would recommend using some very low-shine and medium-hold product, such as a clay or texture powder. You want a lot of texture in there, to give it that rough and messy look. If you don\u2019t want the hair on your forehead, you could angle it off to the side a bit. You can also opt for a full quiff and just add a lot of lift to your hair.\n\nHere are some examples of what I\u2019m talking about regarding the fringe.\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/yiKiNHjv9GSyLM6Q9\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/gaZT4EaPwdzKqHfK8",

I personally was partial to the one on the right in my completely honest opinion. It also might be just the beard being trimmed and styled and having a more streamlined appearance kind of how i feel after getting eyebrows waxed, I think whatever u did to ur beard that day on the right would look good with any hair.",
