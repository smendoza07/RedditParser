He has wanted children for nearly a decade now and his ex-wife didn\u2019t, then agreed to try but apparently wasn\u2019t being truthful about being off birth-control and ultimately told him she never would want kids. \n2. Lack of sex. He recognises this is his fault because his ex-wife never had a high libido to start with but (according to him) he dwindled to almost nothing a few years into their marriage. \n3. They became affectionate roommates more than anything and he wanted more and I made him realise there can be more to a relationship yadiyadiyada. \n\nBut he says number 1 was the biggest issue and that he started resenting her over it but is glad in a way it didn\u2019t happen.",

There was a woman I was seeing regularly who was trying to convince me (perhaps for her sake) that \"she could change her mind!\" when I told her the kind of women I would automatically write off. She insisted that I have too many requirements and \"no one\" thinks that far ahead. I'm like, I don't have time to wait and guess like that. We were both in our late 30's and she has a surprisingly naive view on love and what's romantic.",

If you've been in the Bowl for more than a few months you'd know that most SB's (at least one's I've encountered over the years) don't care about the SD's relationship status, and in fact many prefer taken men.  It limits the time the SB has to spend with him, and in the case of SB's who are scammers / bad actors to blackmail those men.  I'm single but I've had a few SB's dumb enough to brag to me about blackmail / extortion of married SD's.  This is not a dating world where monogamy and true love are the goal, but good for the OP if she found it.  Being a \"shitty cheater\" means nothing in the sugar world in my opinion.\n\nI just hope the OP has a pre-nup......and while it's great that she trusts him and is fully aware of the potential issues, the trade in after he wants something younger comments I read sound like they fit this guys personality.  So trust all you want, but document and protect yourself would be my advise to her.",

There are a few instances where I remember realising he was in for the long-haul:\n\u2022 He insisted on calling me his girlfriend like a month in. I would joke that a married man doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend but a mistress but he hated anything but the word \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.\n\n\u2022 He stopped caring about all kinds of OPSEC super early on. He had a different phone at first to message me he kept in his office and then he got worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to contact him in case of emergency so I got his real number and ultimately he just started messaging me on there. He would also just bring me wherever; we regularly had dates literally a few meters from his workplace. \n\n\u2022 When his wife found out about me I told him he really should be more careful going forward because I didn\u2019t want him to have to stop our relationship over this and he said at that point he didn\u2019t think anything would stop him from being with me. \n\nI believe we were on vacation in Barcelona, like a year in when I thought \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind this lasting for many many more years\u201d but I didn\u2019t have a revelation or anything.",

My husband wasn\u2019t the ideal physical type of 21year old me in the same way I was his ideal type but I did find him physically attractive by the time we had sex with one another. His success definitely plays into that attraction but I only find successful men attractive. \n\n> If he lost all his money would you still stay with him?\n\nDepends. If he lost it because he suddenly decided to spend it all in casinos? No. If he lost it because for whatever reason all his investments failed? Yes.",

When you go from dates once-thrice a week to seeing each other everyday, your relationship deepens. I got really sick last year and for 4 months he had to take care of me. We went from having sex 5 times a week then to almost nothing in those 4 months because I physically just wasn\u2019t able to. I was throwing up multiple times a day daily. He emptied my vomit bucket daily and helped me shower. I used to get scared to get to a place where we\u2019d get \u00ab\u00a0too comfortable\u00a0\u00bb and I still want us to keep some of the excitement of our first year of dating but he has seen me at my lowest now and I\u2019m glad I know I can count on him if I need to.\n\nI just chose to trust him. I made some risky decisions and he could have had me looking like a fool but it worked out. I cannot stress enough how much I do not recommend others doing this because he could have gotten cold feet and not have filed for divorce, or just up and left one day because the situation was messy or just strung me along for years.

We\u2019re in Western-Europe and married under the separate property system, which means all I would normally get if we divorce is alimony (and child support if children are involved). But even alimony wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed because a huge chunk of what he spends monthly comes from capital gains from his investments and on paper he technically doesn\u2019t make much. So let\u2019s say he spends 400k a year, 350k is from the dividends from his portfolio. And it\u2019s not considered \u00ab\u00a0income\u00a0\u00bb so it wouldn\u2019t fall under the calculation for alimony. Only the 50k and it\u2019s very likely that I exceed that once I start working. \n\nThe work-around we found for this is the house we\u2019ll building. I\u2019ll have 70% of the equity even though he\u2019ll be the only one paying for it. It gives me something to fall back on in the event of a divorce. That 70% will be renegotiated after we have kids to a 100%.",

There was a woman I was seeing regularly who was trying to convince me (perhaps for her sake) that \"she could change her mind!\" when I told her the kind of women I would automatically write off. She insisted that I have too many requirements and \"no one\" thinks that far ahead. I'm like, I don't have time to wait and guess like that. We were both in our late 30's and she has a surprisingly naive view on love and what's romantic.",

If you've been in the Bowl for more than a few months you'd know that most SB's (at least one's I've encountered over the years) don't care about the SD's relationship status, and in fact many prefer taken men.  It limits the time the SB has to spend with him, and in the case of SB's who are scammers / bad actors to blackmail those men.  I'm single but I've had a few SB's dumb enough to brag to me about blackmail / extortion of married SD's.  This is not a dating world where monogamy and true love are the goal, but good for the OP if she found it.  Being a \"shitty cheater\" means nothing in the sugar world in my opinion.\n\nI just hope the OP has a pre-nup......and while it's great that she trusts him and is fully aware of the potential issues, the trade in after he wants something younger comments I read sound like they fit this guys personality.

He broke a promise he made to someone else. You're telling him that if he breaks a promise he made to you, then you're out the door. \"Hypocritical\" would be if you told him you wouldn't tolerate something that you have done before.

There are a few instances where I remember realising he was in for the long-haul:\n\u2022 He insisted on calling me his girlfriend like a month in. I would joke that a married man doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend but a mistress but he hated anything but the word \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.\n\n\u2022 He stopped caring about all kinds of OPSEC super early on. He had a different phone at first to message me he kept in his office and then he got worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to contact him in case of emergency so I got his real number and ultimately he just started messaging me on there. He would also just bring me wherever; we regularly had dates literally a few meters from his workplace. \n\n\u2022 When his wife found out about me I told him he really should be more careful going forward because I didn\u2019t want him to have to stop our relationship over this and he said at that point he didn\u2019t think anything would stop him from being with me. \n\nI believe we were on vacation in Barcelona, like a year in when I thought \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind this lasting for many many more years\u201d but I didn\u2019t have a revelation or anything.",

I met his friends and family a bit before he filed, so our circles felt more intertwined from then. \n\nThe dynamic changed slightly but that was to be expected and he wanted it to change. When you go from dates once-thrice a week to seeing each other everyday, your relationship deepens. I got really sick last year and for 4 months he had to take care of me. We went from having sex 5 times a week then to almost nothing in those 4 months because I physically just wasn\u2019t able to. I was throwing up multiple times a day daily. He emptied my vomit bucket daily and helped me shower. I used to get scared to get to a place where we\u2019d get \u00ab\u00a0too comfortable\u00a0\u00bb and I still want us to keep some of the excitement of our first year of dating but he has seen me at my lowest now and I\u2019m glad I know I can count on him if I need to.\n\nI just chose to trust him. I made some risky decisions and he could have had me looking like a fool but it worked out. I cannot stress enough how much I do not recommend others doing this because he could have gotten cold feet and not have filed for divorce, or just up and left one day because the situation was messy or just strung me along for years. I\u2019m super lucky he didn\u2019t. \n\nHow old is your SD\u2019s child?",

We\u2019re in Western-Europe and married under the separate property system, which means all I would normally get if we divorce is alimony (and child support if children are involved). But even alimony wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed because a huge chunk of what he spends monthly comes from capital gains from his investments and on paper he technically doesn\u2019t make much. So let\u2019s say he spends 400k a year, 350k is from the dividends from his portfolio. And it\u2019s not considered \u00ab\u00a0income\u00a0\u00bb so it wouldn\u2019t fall under the calculation for alimony. Only the 50k and it\u2019s very likely that I exceed that once I start working. \n\nThe work-around we found for this is the house we\u2019ll building. I\u2019ll have 70% of the equity even though he\u2019ll be the only one paying for it. It gives me something to fall back on in the event of a divorce. That 70% will be renegotiated after we have kids to a 100%.",

There are a few instances where I remember realising he was in for the long-haul:\n\u2022 He insisted on calling me his girlfriend like a month in. I would joke that a married man doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend but a mistress but he hated anything but the word \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.\n\n\u2022 He stopped caring about all kinds of OPSEC super early on. He had a different phone at first to message me he kept in his office and then he got worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to contact him in case of emergency so I got his real number and ultimately he just started messaging me on there. He would also just bring me wherever; we regularly had dates literally a few meters from his workplace. \n\n\u2022 When his wife found out about me I told him he really should be more careful going forward because I didn\u2019t want him to have to stop our relationship over this and he said at that point he didn\u2019t think anything would stop him from being with me. \n\nI believe we were on vacation in Barcelona, like a year in when I thought \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind this lasting for many many more years\u201d but I didn\u2019t have a revelation or anything.",

If you've been in the Bowl for more than a few months you'd know that most SB's (at least one's I've encountered over the years) don't care about the SD's relationship status, and in fact many prefer taken men.  It limits the time the SB has to spend with him, and in the case of SB's who are scammers / bad actors to blackmail those men.  I'm single but I've had a few SB's dumb enough to brag to me about blackmail / extortion of married SD's.  This is not a dating world where monogamy and true love are the goal, but good for the OP if she found it.  Being a \"shitty cheater\" means nothing in the sugar world in my opinion.\n\nI just hope the OP has a pre-nup......and while it's great that she trusts him and is fully aware of the potential issues, the trade in after he wants something younger comments I read sound like they fit this guys personality.  So trust all you want, but document and protect yourself would be my advise to her.",

There are a few instances where I remember realising he was in for the long-haul:\n\u2022 He insisted on calling me his girlfriend like a month in. I would joke that a married man doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend but a mistress but he hated anything but the word \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.\n\n\u2022 He stopped caring about all kinds of OPSEC super early on. He had a different phone at first to message me he kept in his office and then he got worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to contact him in case of emergency so I got his real number and ultimately he just started messaging me on there. He would also just bring me wherever; we regularly had dates literally a few meters from his workplace. \n\n\u2022 When his wife found out about me I told him he really should be more careful going forward because I didn\u2019t want him to have to stop our relationship over this and he said at that point he didn\u2019t think anything would stop him from being with me. \n\nI believe we were on vacation in Barcelona, like a year in when I thought \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind this lasting for many many more years\u201d but I didn\u2019t have a revelation or anything.",

It limits the time the SB has to spend with him, and in the case of SB's who are scammers / bad actors to blackmail those men.  I'm single but I've had a few SB's dumb enough to brag to me about blackmail / extortion of married SD's.
