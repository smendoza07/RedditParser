    "body": "[Here is the link to my original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/ls8hao/literally_the_most_attractive_person_i_know_just/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nSo, I messaged her the following:\n\n\u201cHey! We actually know each other and the first thing I want to say is I don\u2019t feel awkward having my life be an open book to you or anyone else on here even though it is very discrete from the rest of the world. \n\nI\u2019m new to this site, though not to the SR scene. I understand the boundaries, the process and goals of people who engage in these arrangements.\n\nThe last thing I would want is for you to feel uncomfortable in the slightest, and I don\u2019t say that lightly. I definitely respect you as a person and would never do anything to leave you feeling like you couldn\u2019t trust me.\n\nIn all honestly, I\u2019d move heaven and earth to match with you cause of my regard for you...\u201d\n\nShe messaged me back asking who I was and to see my photos, to which I immediately told her and sent my private pics.\n\nI made a quip about how when I saw her profile I was like \u201coh boy! This could get awkward\u201d and she laughed saying it\u2019s totally fine and then proceeded to engage in messages that would be totally standard for anyone else on the site. She then gave me her cell number and we took it offline.\n\nAfter some banter I told her I would like to set up a m&amp;g and she suggested the very next day. I picked one of my favorite restaurants overlooking the ocean and it turned out to be her favorite places too!\n\nWhen we met up we hugged and grabbed a table, got some drinks and the conversation just started flowing. We\u2019d never talked one on one before and I was surprised how comfortable we both felt just spilling our guts to one another. \n\nWe ate some food, had a bottle of wine (the name is escaping me!) and walked outside to sit in my car to talk privately.\n\nI told her what would interest me most and how I would prefer to start with PPM and see where it leads. She named a number that I was reasonably satisfied with and didn\u2019t even bother negotiating cause I was so happy to have gotten to this point!\n\nI asked her why she decided to meet with me and she explained that she felt very comfortable with me, knew I was \u201csuccessful\u201d and that she wanted to get to know me personally. In turn I explained how attractive she has always been to me and that she is far above and beyond any other woman I\u2019ve seen in the bowl...quite seriously!\n\nAt long last she asked if I needed anything else and I said \u201cI\u2019d really like to kiss you!\u201d and she said \u201cunless you have a room booked I don\u2019t wanna kiss cause I\u2019d need to be able to get your clothes off ASAP\u201d and the way she pressed her lips after saying that about made me die then and there! \n\nSadly, I had other commitments for the afternoon since I was not expecting her to give me the go ahead so quickly! I was totally shocked. I told her that when I woke up the morning of the m&g that it felt better then Christmas morning! \n\nWe\u2019ve got plans to meet this coming week and get the ball rolling. \n\nThank you all for your comments and concerns on my last post and I\u2019m definitely a risk taker, so it felt exhilarating to do this for sure.\n\nEven though I had an unbelievably good experience with this SB interaction, I would still heed the weighted advice of this group and consider your positions carefully. In the end, I was willing to be exposed if the worst would happen, but others aren\u2019t so carefree as me, so just keep that in mind!\n\nTL;DR I saw someone I knew on SA and we\u2019ve already set up an arrangement for the short-term. Wow!\n\nEDIT: not sure what nerve I hit with some of you, though I\u2019m amazed that some of you have found it necessary to private message me telling me what a worthless sack of \ud83d\udca9 you think I am. One reason I have appreciated SLF is for the open-mindedness of the folks here. Let\u2019s not stray from that!",
