    "body": "Every once in a while, I come across a profile on Seeking where I am like:  \"Eh.  She is not conventionally beautiful, but I think she is cute, and rocking her own style. I like that.  Prolly does not get a lot of messages, and I'm a good time.  Let me shoot her a message.\" Then I check back later, and I can see she viewed my profile and private pics, and... rejected me.\n#\nThe absolute AUDACITY.  I can't help but forget that I look like McLovin from *Superbad,* except I have a much stronger aura of virginity.  I sit there in an absolute puddle of outrage.  **How**... How could she do this to me?  I'm a *catch!*  Does she not know how handsome my mom says I am???  I think I finally understand what hot girls would feel if I ever rejected one of them.  (I never would, but you know, hypothetically).  I have exquisite taste in cocktails! And Amazing pick up lines!  But all girls care about is a guy who has hit puberty and has a Justin Bieber haircut.  I... I just hate how my tears water down my merlot.  FML.",
