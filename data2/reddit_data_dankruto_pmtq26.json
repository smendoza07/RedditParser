She even said she loves him during the pain fight but he didn't realize she meant romantically.\n\nIt would have made a lot of sense for him to at least hug her after the fight since he did see what he thought was her getting killed.\n\nThat's just an anime trope though, AoT is the same way and I think a lot of other anime have it too, particularly shonen.\n\nHis real problem was not being able to sit still and gets in trouble because of it.

It has good animation that fits with the show, but it makes everything seem bright and cheery all the time, even in more serious moments. The voice acting for most the new cast is dog shit, and the old cast got complete character rewrites. Like my g, whoever did temari doesn't understand her character. Atleast they improved Sakura. She's likeable. But there's a bunch of plot holes in connection to the original series. Like Naruto still being a genin even though he was getting knowledge so he can be a jonin, and is a jonin by the end of the series and in the last movie. Some of the character designs are atroshish, and someone needs to fix these hair styles and outfits. Gaaras hair in the wedding arc was perfect for him. If you need to change it, make it a little more formal and cleaner. But don't make him hitler. Narutos hair would be perfect if it was a tad bit longer and not so damn spikey. We don't need to be smelling hair jel everywhere he goes. No complaints on shino though. It doesn't fit with his shipuden self, but its a welcome change and fits his character progression. \n\n\nAll in all, boruto has some good moments, mainly the last 20 episodes, but its 215 episodes long and the first 150 are almost all shit, with 1 decent arc being the time travel arc and even then, its not that great. If it wasn't a sequal to Naruto, and wasn't connected to Naruto in any way, it'd be a decent show. Not good, because it has problems outside of its connection to the og cast and Naruto world, like voice acting, but it'd be decent and watchable.",

She even said she loves him during the pain fight but he didn't realize she meant romantically.\n\nIt would have made a lot of sense for him to at least hug her after the fight since he did see what he thought was her getting killed.\n\nThat's just an anime trope though, AoT is the same way and I think a lot of other anime have it too, particularly shonen.\n\nHis real problem was not being able to sit still and gets in trouble because of it.

It has good animation that fits with the show, but it makes everything seem bright and cheery all the time, even in more serious moments. The voice acting for most the new cast is dog shit, and the old cast got complete character rewrites. Like my g, whoever did temari doesn't understand her character. Atleast they improved Sakura. She's likeable. But there's a bunch of plot holes in connection to the original series. Like Naruto still being a genin even though he was getting knowledge so he can be a jonin, and is a jonin by the end of the series and in the last movie. Some of the character designs are atroshish, and someone needs to fix these hair styles and outfits. Gaaras hair in the wedding arc was perfect for him. If you need to change it, make it a little more formal and cleaner. But don't make him hitler. Narutos hair would be perfect if it was a tad bit longer and not so damn spikey. We don't need to be smelling hair jel everywhere he goes. No complaints on shino though. It doesn't fit with his shipuden self, but its a welcome change and fits his character progression. \n\n\nAll in all, boruto has some good moments, mainly the last 20 episodes, but its 215 episodes long and the first 150 are almost all shit, with 1 decent arc being the time travel arc and even then, its not that great. If it wasn't a sequal to Naruto, and wasn't connected to Naruto in any way, it'd be a decent show. Not good, because it has problems outside of its connection to the og cast and Naruto world, like voice acting, but it'd be decent and watchable.",

She even said she loves him during the pain fight but he didn't realize she meant romantically.\n\nIt would have made a lot of sense for him to at least hug her after the fight since he did see what he thought was her getting killed.\n\nThat's just an anime trope though, AoT is the same way and I think a lot of other anime have it too, particularly shonen.\n\nHis real problem was not being able to sit still and gets in trouble because of it.

It has good animation that fits with the show, but it makes everything seem bright and cheery all the time, even in more serious moments. The voice acting for most the new cast is dog shit, and the old cast got complete character rewrites. Like my g, whoever did temari doesn't understand her character. Atleast they improved Sakura. She's likeable. But there's a bunch of plot holes in connection to the original series. Like Naruto still being a genin even though he was getting knowledge so he can be a jonin, and is a jonin by the end of the series and in the last movie. Some of the character designs are atroshish, and someone needs to fix these hair styles and outfits. Gaaras hair in the wedding arc was perfect for him. If you need to change it, make it a little more formal and cleaner. But don't make him hitler. Narutos hair would be perfect if it was a tad bit longer and not so damn spikey. We don't need to be smelling hair jel everywhere he goes. No complaints on shino though. It doesn't fit with his shipuden self, but its a welcome change and fits his character progression. \n\n\nAll in all, boruto has some good moments, mainly the last 20 episodes, but its 215 episodes long and the first 150 are almost all shit, with 1 decent arc being the time travel arc and even then, its not that great. If it wasn't a sequal to Naruto, and wasn't connected to Naruto in any way, it'd be a decent show. Not good, because it has problems outside of its connection to the og cast and Naruto world, like voice acting, but it'd be decent and watchable.",

It has good animation that fits with the show, but it makes everything seem bright and cheery all the time, even in more serious moments. The voice acting for most the new cast is dog shit, and the old cast got complete character rewrites. Like my g, whoever did temari doesn't understand her character. Atleast they improved Sakura. She's likeable. But there's a bunch of plot holes in connection to the original series. Like Naruto still being a genin even though he was getting knowledge so he can be a jonin, and is a jonin by the end of the series and in the last movie. Some of the character designs are atroshish, and someone needs to fix these hair styles and outfits. Gaaras hair in the wedding arc was perfect for him. If you need to change it, make it a little more formal and cleaner. But don't make him hitler. Narutos hair would be perfect if it was a tad bit longer and not so damn spikey. We don't need to be smelling hair jel everywhere he goes. No complaints on shino though. It doesn't fit with his shipuden self, but its a welcome change and fits his character progression. \n\n\nAll in all, boruto has some good moments, mainly the last 20 episodes, but its 215 episodes long and the first 150 are almost all shit, with 1 decent arc being the time travel arc and even then, its not that great. If it wasn't a sequal to Naruto, and wasn't connected to Naruto in any way, it'd be a decent show. Not good, because it has problems outside of its connection to the og cast and Naruto world, like voice acting, but it'd be decent and watchable.",
