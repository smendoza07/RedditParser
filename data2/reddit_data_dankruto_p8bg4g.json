I have a hard time believing he knows everything, because he strikes me as a sweet kid who is a lot more inherently ethical.  I would be heartbroken if I found out my parent kidnapped and experimented on 60 kids, 59 of which died from the experiment. \n\nI know this is less bad, but I also wonder if Inojin knows that Sai was in the Foundation, or what the Foundation is. Sai... did some bad shit as far as I am aware before he was put on Team 7. \n\nBoruto is already an asshole towards Naruto, but I'm sure he would judge heavily all the stuff Naruto had to do to keep the villages intact.",

If he learns about Naruto more he will more guilty for being bratty to him. And that feelings will help him develop a brotherly hood with Kawaki. The development I told is that he almost died from saving Sasuke and telling Naruto to run away from isshiki and trying to suicide since isshiki needs boruto alive",

Boruto does seem a bit nicer to him after the time travel arc, though. \n\nAlso, I encourage you to use spoiler tags so that folks don't get spoiled! Personally I don't care, but it's more for others' sake. :)",

If he's disassembled in a ditch then he's no longer immortal and will die as soon as Jashin realizes he's not getting any bodies.

At this point in the series, he's just a skeleton. Also if you gave him every benefit of the doubt, maybe Zetsu was really fast and got away with getting in, someone being exploded by millions of paper bombs would likely just be a bunch of bacon bits, kakuzu would have to be revived and would have to re-organize EVERY SINGLE unidentifiable piece of meat on hidan's body until he was the shape of a human again, and would have to sew it all up, because Hidan needed Kakuzu's stitching to rebuild himself as we see when Asuma chops his head off.",

I have a hard time believing he knows everything, because he strikes me as a sweet kid who is a lot more inherently ethical.  I would be heartbroken if I found out my parent kidnapped and experimented on 60 kids, 59 of which died from the experiment. \n\nI know this is less bad, but I also wonder if Inojin knows that Sai was in the Foundation, or what the Foundation is. Sai... did some bad shit as far as I am aware before he was put on Team 7. \n\nBoruto is already an asshole towards Naruto, but I'm sure he would judge heavily all the stuff Naruto had to do to keep the villages intact.",

There are so many ways it could go from there too. Might even provide her more incentive to become Hokage, so that she can try to ensure that there's never a clan like the Uchiha again.",

If he's disassembled in a ditch then he's no longer immortal and will die as soon as Jashin realizes he's not getting any bodies. Even if Zetsu got Hidan immediately after Shikamaru left, he stated that the forest he was buried in was heavily guarded by thr Nara clan so no one gets in or out. At this point in the series, he's just a skeleton. Also if you gave him every benefit of the doubt, maybe Zetsu was really fast and got away with getting in, someone being exploded by millions of paper bombs would likely just be a bunch of bacon bits, kakuzu would have to be revived and would have to re-organize EVERY SINGLE unidentifiable piece of meat on hidan's body until he was the shape of a human again, and would have to sew it all up, because Hidan needed Kakuzu's stitching to rebuild himself as we see when Asuma chops his head off.",

I have a hard time believing he knows everything, because he strikes me as a sweet kid who is a lot more inherently ethical.  I would be heartbroken if I found out my parent kidnapped and experimented on 60 kids, 59 of which died from the experiment. \n\nI know this is less bad, but I also wonder if Inojin knows that Sai was in the Foundation, or what the Foundation is. Sai... did some bad shit as far as I am aware before he was put on Team 7. \n\nBoruto is already an asshole towards Naruto, but I'm sure he would judge heavily all the stuff Naruto had to do to keep the villages intact.",

Boruto does seem a bit nicer to him after the time travel arc, though. \n\nAlso, I encourage you to use spoiler tags so that folks don't get spoiled! Personally I don't care, but it's more for others' sake. :)",
