He wasn\u2019t some criminal mastermind. He\u2019s someone who was told what to do at 12 and had Zetsu there to watch his every move.

They have a history AND have been through the exact same tragedy, whereas Naruto only just met the guy for like a day. He only knows that he's similar to Obito because others told him so. He himself doesn't know Obito at all. But Kakashi, Minato and maybe somewhat Guy do. They would of been better choices in my opinion to convince him to turn to his old ways.",

The parallels are well-established and Obito is trying his hardest to crush Naruto's spirit so he can justify to himself that he was right to stray from the path of goodness.\n\nWhat bothered me about Obito's Talk-no-jutsu is how it was done. With Pain, Naruto listened to Nagato tell his story, takes in his perspective, and then used to their common connection with Jiriaya and the book to convince Nagato that while Naruto didn't have a solution, it was still better than Nagato's way and showed Nagato that despite the pain he had put him through Naruto hadn't succumbed to hate. That showed Nagato that maybe Naruto had a chance at establishing true peace.\n\nWith Obito all Naruto does is shout \"You wanted to be Hokage\" at him until he wears Obito down. All Naruto knew about Obito was that he was Kakashi's old friend who wanted to be Hokage. But he didn't know Obito's story. He didn't know why he flipped. He wasn't even aware of his personality. The \"Hokage argument\" should have been the finisher, but instead that's all Naruto will talk about in regards to Obito.",

Nothing he could have done would make up for his grotesque experimentations on innocent people and being responsible for the death of the third Hokage and that's not even everything. And for that matter, Kabuto also should have gone down with him. Doing some good things doesn't erase the bad, especially in the case of someone like Orochimaru where the damage tally is way high.\n\nAnd yes we know there are Ninja prisons and we also know most of the shinobi in them didn't commit crimes nearly as heinous as Orochimaru too. \n\nAs for Sasuke, I don't agree with him being pardoned but I can definitely see someone like Kakashi and others fighting for that and why they would but in Orochimaru's case it's baffling.",

They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

He\u2019s obviously a selfish, heavily troubled, and most likely mentally ill character. Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",

They have a history AND have been through the exact same tragedy, whereas Naruto only just met the guy for like a day. He only knows that he's similar to Obito because others told him so. He himself doesn't know Obito at all. But Kakashi, Minato and maybe somewhat Guy do. They would of been better choices in my opinion to convince him to turn to his old ways.",

Thats why your examples aren't good ones. Its the same reason Sasuke fled the village even after a sincere heart-to-heart from Kakashi. Sometimes you just can't hear things from people that are too close to you, but hearing it from a stranger will click.",

The parallels are well-established and Obito is trying his hardest to crush Naruto's spirit so he can justify to himself that he was right to stray from the path of goodness.\n\nWhat bothered me about Obito's Talk-no-jutsu is how it was done. With Pain, Naruto listened to Nagato tell his story, takes in his perspective, and then used to their common connection with Jiriaya and the book to convince Nagato that while Naruto didn't have a solution, it was still better than Nagato's way and showed Nagato that despite the pain he had put him through Naruto hadn't succumbed to hate. That showed Nagato that maybe Naruto had a chance at establishing true peace.\n\nWith Obito all Naruto does is shout \"You wanted to be Hokage\" at him until he wears Obito down. All Naruto knew about Obito was that he was Kakashi's old friend who wanted to be Hokage. But he didn't know Obito's story. He didn't know why he flipped. He wasn't even aware of his personality. The \"Hokage argument\" should have been the finisher, but instead that's all Naruto will talk about in regards to Obito.",

And for that matter, Kabuto also should have gone down with him. Doing some good things doesn't erase the bad, especially in the case of someone like Orochimaru where the damage tally is way high.\n\nAnd yes we know there are Ninja prisons and we also know most of the shinobi in them didn't commit crimes nearly as heinous as Orochimaru too. \n\nAs for Sasuke, I don't agree with him being pardoned but I can definitely see someone like Kakashi and others fighting for that and why they would but in Orochimaru's case it's baffling.",

They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

He\u2019s obviously a selfish, heavily troubled, and most likely mentally ill character. Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",

They have a history AND have been through the exact same tragedy, whereas Naruto only just met the guy for like a day. He only knows that he's similar to Obito because others told him so.

The parallels are well-established and Obito is trying his hardest to crush Naruto's spirit so he can justify to himself that he was right to stray from the path of goodness.\n\nWhat bothered me about Obito's Talk-no-jutsu is how it was done. With Pain, Naruto listened to Nagato tell his story, takes in his perspective, and then used to their common connection with Jiriaya and the book to convince Nagato that while Naruto didn't have a solution, it was still better than Nagato's way and showed Nagato that despite the pain he had put him through Naruto hadn't succumbed to hate. That showed Nagato that maybe Naruto had a chance at establishing true peace.\n\nWith Obito all Naruto does is shout \"You wanted to be Hokage\" at him until he wears Obito down. All Naruto knew about Obito was that he was Kakashi's old friend who wanted to be Hokage. But he didn't know Obito's story. He didn't know why he flipped. He wasn't even aware of his personality. The \"Hokage argument\" should have been the finisher, but instead that's all Naruto will talk about in regards to Obito.",

Nothing he could have done would make up for his grotesque experimentations on innocent people and being responsible for the death of the third Hokage and that's not even everything. And for that matter, Kabuto also should have gone down with him. Doing some good things doesn't erase the bad, especially in the case of someone like Orochimaru where the damage tally is way high.\n\nAnd yes we know there are Ninja prisons and we also know most of the shinobi in them didn't commit crimes nearly as heinous as Orochimaru too. \n\nAs for Sasuke, I don't agree with him being pardoned but I can definitely see someone like Kakashi and others fighting for that and why they would but in Orochimaru's case it's baffling.",

They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

He\u2019s obviously a selfish, heavily troubled, and most likely mentally ill character. Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",

The parallels are well-established and Obito is trying his hardest to crush Naruto's spirit so he can justify to himself that he was right to stray from the path of goodness.\n\nWhat bothered me about Obito's Talk-no-jutsu is how it was done. With Pain, Naruto listened to Nagato tell his story, takes in his perspective, and then used to their common connection with Jiriaya and the book to convince Nagato that while Naruto didn't have a solution, it was still better than Nagato's way and showed Nagato that despite the pain he had put him through Naruto hadn't succumbed to hate. That showed Nagato that maybe Naruto had a chance at establishing true peace.\n\nWith Obito all Naruto does is shout \"You wanted to be Hokage\" at him until he wears Obito down. All Naruto knew about Obito was that he was Kakashi's old friend who wanted to be Hokage. But he didn't know Obito's story. He didn't know why he flipped. He wasn't even aware of his personality. The \"Hokage argument\" should have been the finisher, but instead that's all Naruto will talk about in regards to Obito.",

They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

He\u2019s obviously a selfish, heavily troubled, and most likely mentally ill character. Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",

The parallels are well-established and Obito is trying his hardest to crush Naruto's spirit so he can justify to himself that he was right to stray from the path of goodness.\n\nWhat bothered me about Obito's Talk-no-jutsu is how it was done. With Pain, Naruto listened to Nagato tell his story, takes in his perspective, and then used to their common connection with Jiriaya and the book to convince Nagato that while Naruto didn't have a solution, it was still better than Nagato's way and showed Nagato that despite the pain he had put him through Naruto hadn't succumbed to hate. That showed Nagato that maybe Naruto had a chance at establishing true peace.\n\nWith Obito all Naruto does is shout \"You wanted to be Hokage\" at him until he wears Obito down. All Naruto knew about Obito was that he was Kakashi's old friend who wanted to be Hokage. But he didn't know Obito's story. He didn't know why he flipped. He wasn't even aware of his personality. The \"Hokage argument\" should have been the finisher, but instead that's all Naruto will talk about in regards to Obito.",

They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

He\u2019s obviously a selfish, heavily troubled, and most likely mentally ill character. Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",

They have a history AND have been through the exact same tragedy, whereas Naruto only just met the guy for like a day. He only knows that he's similar to Obito because others told him so. He himself doesn't know Obito at all. But Kakashi, Minato and maybe somewhat Guy do. They would of been better choices in my opinion to convince him to turn to his old ways.",

                    "body": "> he was a poor sensei \n\nHe taught the Sanin. Sure Oro went on to become evil, but that was part of his character. They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

He\u2019s obviously a selfish, heavily troubled, and most likely mentally ill character. Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",

They became the strongest by training under him and then expanding more after him\n\n> responsible for a near civil war, the Uchiha massacre \n\nNot completely. He was opposed to massacring the Uchihas, instead he wanted dialogue with them and was willing to transition Hokage position to them if it meant no blood shed. The Uchiha's resentment also started because of Tobirama's mistreatment and distrust of them, and Danzo antagonizing them. Also doesn't help that Obito controlled Kurama and caused the destruction, which only further singled out the Uchihas as being behind the attack, which you can't blame Hiruzen for. \n\n> Orochimaru attacking the village \n\nHow was Hiruzen supposed to know the Kazekage was dead and Oro was perpetrating the attack? That's like saying it was Tsunade's fault for Pain destroying Konoha, or Minato's fault for Obito unleashing Kurama. Though I'll give the blame to Hiruzen for not arresting Oro when he could've years ago. \n\n> indirectly responsible for the Great Shinobi War and forming of Akatsuki \n\nLOL. How is he responsible for those? Cuz his student was in the Akatsuki? By that logic, Hashirama is responsible for the 4^th Great Ninja War, cuz he didn't check to make sure if Madara was truly dead, as Madara orchestrated the creation of the Akatsuki through heavy manipulation and planning of the War. And if anything, Danzo is the reason the Akatsuki went from being a good group fighting injustice to become evil. Had he not gone to Amegakure with his Anbu, Yahiko wouldn't have died, and so Nagato wouldn't have gone mad. Also, Obito was behind the meeting of Danzo and Hanzo, and he held back the Akatsuki grunts. He twisted Nagato. Plus Hiruzen kept tabs on Akatsuki and their moves through Itachi. \n\n> and even the 9 tails being released\n\nHow? Hiruzen wasn't Hokage anymore, and he was chilling in the village when Kushina was giving birth. Why would he join them? Minato was there, and he had the Anbu for security. Minato even blames himself for not being a better sensei to Obito and Kakashi.\n\nHiruzen gets so much shit for stuff he has no control over. He sought to uphold Hashirama's ideals of a peaceful world and village, and for that he had to make sacrifices, like Neji's father. He isn't half as bad as people make him out to be, and he isn't responsible for the shortcoming of others.",

Rin was more of the last straw for him. \n\nThink about it like this. His parents were dead, he was outcasted from his own clan, bullied because of his lack of ability, all alone despite one girl who doesn\u2019t even return his feelings in the same way. Now throw him into a brutal war (a child soldier literally). He most likely has already witnessed lots of his childhood peers dying, maybe some teachers he looked up to. He\u2019s seen grown men ruthlessly slaughter to win, some of them even seem to enjoy doing it.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take away his ability to use his right body. Whatever chance he had at protecting his friends with his new sharingan is now pretty much gone. His short, sad life is coming to an end. But despite that, he still keeps an optimistic outlook. Even when he\u2019s with Madara he doesn\u2019t allow himself to be manipulated. So after what is probably a few years (Judging by how much his hair grew) of nothing but dark isolation, he finally leaves to go see his friends. All he wants is to protect them, and the first thing he sees after all that is his friend being murdered. Not just a simple death either, she is violently having her chest ripped open by someone she loved, and Obito knew that and was accepting of it. He looks around him and people aren\u2019t even concerned about the fact that a child was killed, they\u2019re just complaining about how they failed their mission.\n\nIf by the end of that, you have your sanity still in tact, you have some inhuman levels of willpower. Remember Obito seemed to genuinely believe the world he was living in was fake. Kakashi even told him he was delusional. Obito is practically a schizophrenic. He can\u2019t process things in a healthy way. His whole life he carried inhuman levels of pain, and because he didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone else with it, he kept it all to himself.",
