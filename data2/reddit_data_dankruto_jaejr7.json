Once the Alabasta arc starts it constantly stays amazing even until what\u2019s going on now 15 years later however the anime itself (not the story) goes up and down in quality. Mainly stretches of poor animation/bad pacing. I started reading the manga a little bit after the timeskip because they were only adapting one chapter an episode. For me One Piece as a story itself is a lot better but Naruto as far as anime quality is better. The only things I\u2019d give Naruto is the fights are better and I\u2019d tie the two series has far as villains go. Once again just my opinion if you feel like watching it go ahead if you don\u2019t then don\u2019t.",

So we have 150+ episodes of filler. Sure their extensions of the characters but it\u2019s filler. And when you have filler mainly filler your shows quality dwindles unless said filler is really enjoyable. Lee vs sorra was an example of great filler in Shipp\u016bden. Even then the way the show was set up it would go into filler hell and we would know it, this show is just filler overall",

If PT 1 turns you on then more power to you. I'm just saying that I can't get off to it knowing that Naruto and Sasuke pop of super hard when they get the Sage of Sixth paths power ups\n\nI actually enjoy Boruto because I genuinely think it's better than part 1 Naruto. Now that could be because it's just so damn old, but I think that Boruto can body a lot of the pt 1 shinobi",

They instead feel like uninspired re-hashes of their parents, or simply combinations of their parents most notable traits. \n- Because it\u2019s literally the NEXT generation rather than skipping a few, the characters, and thus the story as a whole feel stagnant unless they crap all over the high points of the previous generation. We don\u2019t really care to see Sarada make Sasuke\u2019s achievements look like nothing, but at the same time she\u2019s gonna look like a \u201cfailure\u201d compared to him if she isn\u2019t farting out Mangekyou Sharingan techniques soon. \n\nNostalgia is a huge factor, not gonna lie. Most of us grew up with these characters, and we saw them grow up in a world that was large, unknown, and challenged them. Now we feel like bitter boomers watching these little shits achieve the same, or better results, without going through half the struggle their parents did lol",

Naruto always wanted to be hokage and that was his goal from day one but Boruto has no idea why he even wants to become a shinobi let alone hokage so it's really interesting following this kid while he finds his footing in this definitive era of peace. The cast of characters are also really fun especially Mistuki who is actually my personal favorite character in the show also the contemporary look in Konoha in the show is so beautiful aesthetically the old village juxtaposed with the new modern day tech is quite spectacular Konoha looks like a New York for shinobi (P.S I've never been to New York).",

On top of that it\u2019s a behemoth of a show, Then for me personally I\u2019m not a fan of stretch powers so it\u2019d be hard for me to power through bad animation on top of boring powers imo at least. But black Clover is just bad aside from certain moments like the fight with the wizard king of when asta first let yami. I just want to\nMention the fact that they gave asta a big ass sword that doesn\u2019t even cut. They gave him 2 swords that don\u2019t cut. The show would be a thousand times better to me if took it self more seriously, as in making asta less of a joke",

Once the Alabasta arc starts it constantly stays amazing even until what\u2019s going on now 15 years later however the anime itself (not the story) goes up and down in quality. Mainly stretches of poor animation/bad pacing. I started reading the manga a little bit after the timeskip because they were only adapting one chapter an episode. For me One Piece as a story itself is a lot better but Naruto as far as anime quality is better. The only things I\u2019d give Naruto is the fights are better and I\u2019d tie the two series has far as villains go. Once again just my opinion if you feel like watching it go ahead if you don\u2019t then don\u2019t.",

If PT 1 turns you on then more power to you. I'm just saying that I can't get off to it knowing that Naruto and Sasuke pop of super hard when they get the Sage of Sixth paths power ups\n\nI actually enjoy Boruto because I genuinely think it's better than part 1 Naruto. Now that could be because it's just so damn old, but I think that Boruto can body a lot of the pt 1 shinobi",

What they could have done is probably explain what happened in the gap between the war and leading up to Naruto being Hokage. Probably more of an introduction to the gods and Sasuke living with his sins. However I like that they did add another generation. Technically it's not even Naruto. It's Boruto's story. So the Naruto series is over. It's Boruto's time to shine and for him to figure out what he wants to do with his life",

But black Clover is just bad aside from certain moments like the fight with the wizard king of when asta first let yami. I just want to\nMention the fact that they gave asta a big ass sword that doesn\u2019t even cut. They gave him 2 swords that don\u2019t cut.

Once the Alabasta arc starts it constantly stays amazing even until what\u2019s going on now 15 years later however the anime itself (not the story) goes up and down in quality. Mainly stretches of poor animation/bad pacing. I started reading the manga a little bit after the timeskip because they were only adapting one chapter an episode. For me One Piece as a story itself is a lot better but Naruto as far as anime quality is better. The only things I\u2019d give Naruto is the fights are better and I\u2019d tie the two series has far as villains go. Once again just my opinion if you feel like watching it go ahead if you don\u2019t then don\u2019t.",

Anything other than 51-65 and 148-151 is novels.\n\nTo call the Boruto anime bad is fine. But to call the Boruto manga bad because the Boruto anime is bad is moronic.",

If PT 1 turns you on then more power to you. I'm just saying that I can't get off to it knowing that Naruto and Sasuke pop of super hard when they get the Sage of Sixth paths power ups\n\nI actually enjoy Boruto because I genuinely think it's better than part 1 Naruto. Now that could be because it's just so damn old, but I think that Boruto can body a lot of the pt 1 shinobi",

I'm just saying that I can't get off to it knowing that Naruto and Sasuke pop of super hard when they get the Sage of Sixth paths power ups\n\nI actually enjoy Boruto because I genuinely think it's better than part 1 Naruto.

With the Cyber Punk thing they got going on with Kara it's not going to be peaceful for long. Especially when Boruto hit 16 and controls the Jogan and Kawaki obliterates the village",

Each episode of the Boruto anime is equal to roughly 1 chapter of the Boruto manga, the anime comes out weekly and the manga comes out monthly.\n\nPretty much everything that the anime is doing is filler so that it's able to catch up to its already slow manga, the next manga arc has been slated to be adapted in around 5 episodes.",

They spent a great deal in the beginning on when they were still in the academy and that was pretty cool to see the next generation grow up in an era of peace. Although it did cause it to be a bit slow it was nice seeing all of them individually",

I personally like how it showed the students going through the academy. After the war Naruto pretty much has all the tailed beasts power so I don't see a point in continuing a story of an OP character. He became Hokage so now it's time for the next generation to grow up. With the Cyber Punk thing they got going on with Kara it's not going to be peaceful for long. Especially when Boruto hit 16 and controls the Jogan and Kawaki obliterates the village",

I'm just saying that I can't get off to it knowing that Naruto and Sasuke pop of super hard when they get the Sage of Sixth paths power ups\n\nI actually enjoy Boruto because I genuinely think it's better than part 1 Naruto.

Z, and Super are just more exciting because they offer so much more like Super Saiyan and more of an insight on the Z fighters. If PT 1 turns you on then more power to you. I'm just saying that I can't get off to it knowing that Naruto and Sasuke pop of super hard when they get the Sage of Sixth paths power ups\n\nI actually enjoy Boruto because I genuinely think it's better than part 1 Naruto. Now that could be because it's just so damn old, but I think that Boruto can body a lot of the pt 1 shinobi",
