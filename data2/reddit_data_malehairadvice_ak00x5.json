You can get volume like this. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do that you can try some volumizing moose and a hair dryer. Towel dry out of the shower, apply the moose while hair is damp, then blow dry to style. \n\nEdit: https://imgur.com/gallery/xiwUE4m ",

I was referring to if your hair is thin you might not be able to achieve this look without a lot of product. \n\nIf your hair is thick just use less product. \n\nBut I seriously recommend trying out not washing your hair for a while. I haven\u2019t used shampoo or any kind of hair product for the last 6 months and I\u2019ve been able to achieve this look. Hair is greasy for the first 2 weeks but then your body balances itself out. I just really scrub water through my hair with my fingernails.  ",

Just under 2 weeks for me. And it stopped looking greasy. Your hair gets much thicker and much tougher as well. It feels and looks like it has much more volume. \n\nI HAVE ONLY TRIED THIS ON ME THOUGH. Maybe if you are super sweaty it won\u2019t work\ud83d\ude02. But some of my friends are copying me now cause my hair looks great! \n\nI think it\u2019s absolutely worth a shot, if you hate it just wash it.

I\u2019ve asked several of my friends including girls to smell my hair cause I used to be insecure about the scent. They all said it smells weird, but not because it was gross, but because it was just hair. People aren\u2019t used to smelling just hair. Also the \u201chair smell\u201d isn\u2019t very strong at all. ",

I\u2019ve asked several of my friends including girls to smell my hair cause I used to be insecure about the scent. They all said it smells weird, but not because it was gross, but because it was just hair. People aren\u2019t used to smelling just hair. Also the \u201chair smell\u201d isn\u2019t very strong at all. ",
