Big Bang TOP was the guest & his secrets were exposed by Daesung.\n\n4. SJH 'Hot Issue dance'.\n\n5. Elder Yoon Jong Shin putting in Ramen MSG secretly because Hyori don't allow them.\n\n6. YJS keep promoting KJK song on the show.\n\n7. YJS solo concert & the show had a singing practice for the end year award(sadly Hyori was hospitalised during the award show).\n\n8. YJS sleeping near the door because Haejin pretended to be sick.\n\n9. The triangle lovelines between Hyori,Yejin & KJK.",
