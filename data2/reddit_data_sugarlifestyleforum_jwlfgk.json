I\u2019ve literally had men say \u201cwoc aren\u2019t worth that much\u201d , \u201cstop being greedy\u201d, \u201cmy last SB would blow me off for 100$ a week\u201d, \u201cmy last SB was cheaper\u201d,etc.",

He didn\u2019t want to be with somebody in their 20s, bc that was too close to his kids\u2019 age. I never asked for a specific amount, but the number he offered was great. There was no need to barter.\n\nHe was very respectful, mature, and *never* pushed any of my boundaries. Also gave a really nice allowance every time we stayed together.\n\nHe was attractive. He truly didn\u2019t need to pay for sex. He was in his 50s, but looked younger. He was sugaring to avoid the emotional strings that often come with purely vanilla dating.\n\nI have a theory that men seeking *very* young women are perhaps looking for vulnerability and/or exploitability, in addition to the \u201chot young girl\u201d thing. Ie: if she\u2019s young, she\u2019ll demand/expect less, or won\u2019t truly know how valuable she is as a person, regardless of sugar.\n\nTl;dr: my best and only long-term SD didn\u2019t try to lowball me, and he understood the benefits of being with an older SB, relative to the 18-22y/o demographic). Perhaps older men (50+) who only want women below age 22 are kinda creepy predators.",

There was no need to barter.\n\nHe was very respectful, mature, and *never* pushed any of my boundaries. Also gave a really nice allowance every time we stayed together.\n\nHe was attractive. He truly didn\u2019t need to pay for sex. He was in his 50s, but looked younger. He was sugaring to avoid the emotional strings that often come with purely vanilla dating.\n\nI have a theory that men seeking *very* young women are perhaps looking for vulnerability and/or exploitability, in addition to the \u201chot young girl\u201d thing. Ie: if she\u2019s young, she\u2019ll demand/expect less, or won\u2019t truly know how valuable she is as a person, regardless of sugar.\n\nTl;dr: my best and only long-term SD didn\u2019t try to lowball me, and he understood the benefits of being with an older SB, relative to the 18-22y/o demographic).

He didn\u2019t want to be with somebody in their 20s, bc that was too close to his kids\u2019 age. I never asked for a specific amount, but the number he offered was great. There was no need to barter.\n\nHe was very respectful, mature, and *never* pushed any of my boundaries. Also gave a really nice allowance every time we stayed together.\n\nHe was attractive. He truly didn\u2019t need to pay for sex. He was in his 50s, but looked younger. He was sugaring to avoid the emotional strings that often come with purely vanilla dating.\n\nI have a theory that men seeking *very* young women are perhaps looking for vulnerability and/or exploitability, in addition to the \u201chot young girl\u201d thing. Ie: if she\u2019s young, she\u2019ll demand/expect less, or won\u2019t truly know how valuable she is as a person, regardless of sugar.\n\nTl;dr: my best and only long-term SD didn\u2019t try to lowball me, and he understood the benefits of being with an older SB, relative to the 18-22y/o demographic). Perhaps older men (50+) who only want women below age 22 are kinda creepy predators.",

My point is that the woman who posted this is just venting about the hagglers trying to come into Louboutin. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not Louboutin. It doesn\u2019t mean that there arent plenty of buyers for Louboutin. \n\nI get messages constantly about how I\u2019m not worth XYZ, but I\u2019ve dated men my entire life who can afford to participate in my lifestyle with me. I vent the same way this woman does at times. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m worth less or one of the women overvaluing myself. If there weren\u2019t buyers, I won\u2019t post something so bold. lol",

He didn\u2019t want to be with somebody in their 20s, bc that was too close to his kids\u2019 age. I never asked for a specific amount, but the number he offered was great. There was no need to barter.\n\nHe was very respectful, mature, and *never* pushed any of my boundaries. Also gave a really nice allowance every time we stayed together.\n\nHe was attractive. He truly didn\u2019t need to pay for sex. He was in his 50s, but looked younger. He was sugaring to avoid the emotional strings that often come with purely vanilla dating.\n\nI have a theory that men seeking *very* young women are perhaps looking for vulnerability and/or exploitability, in addition to the \u201chot young girl\u201d thing. Ie: if she\u2019s young, she\u2019ll demand/expect less, or won\u2019t truly know how valuable she is as a person, regardless of sugar.\n\nTl;dr: my best and only long-term SD didn\u2019t try to lowball me, and he understood the benefits of being with an older SB, relative to the 18-22y/o demographic). Perhaps older men (50+) who only want women below age 22 are kinda creepy predators.",
