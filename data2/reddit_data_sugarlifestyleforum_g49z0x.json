    "body": "Can\u2019t believe my luck \n\nI had been in the bowl a few months. Met my fair share of creeps. Had two arrangements that weren\u2019t what I actually wanted. (With a fair amount of blatant dishonesty from the SDs.) \n\nThen I got a message from a SD who lived just 6 miles away. Cant say he wowed me over text at first. (I really just assumed English wasn\u2019t his first language.) He seemed familiar with arrangements (covered the basic compatibility questions, and asked what \u201clevel of support\u201d I was looking for.) After a few hiccups in setting up the meet, we finalized dinner at a steakhouse. Coincidently it was the day before my birthday. \n\nThis man literally showed up with a bouquet of a dozen red roses (I didn\u2019t even realize the joke until recently) and a gift bag. During the course of our texting we had briefly discussed vaporizers vs cigarettes. Wouldn\u2019t you know it? He got me my own Juul with a buncha refills! And a little stuffed animal for my child. It seems silly, but, excluding family, no one had ever given me flowers!\n\nAfter dinner we kept talking in the parking lot and then sat in his car. At some point I made a comment about acing a \u201cperception check\u201d (DnD reference) and he was floored. Neither of us had any nerd/geek/gamer stuff in our profiles. He couldn\u2019t believe I was into it. It was so great. We clicked on so many levels. \n\nThen he pulled out the PPM I specified and said he wanted to send me the rest of the allowance via PayPal. Asked if I\u2019d like to go a hotel, which I declined and he respected. A little later he gave me a back rub and I could tell he\u2019d be good in bed. I mentioned that I would definitely be excited to sleep with him. He laughed and said he really respected me. \u201cI hand you xxx dollars and you\u2019re not sure if you want sex, but are certain after a massage.\u201d We ended up just talking until 1am. He sent me the rest of allowance via PayPal the next morning and I couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nOn our second intimate date he told me he got me a surprise. After I asked for advice about my desktop (~10 years old) he decided I needed a laptop and ordered me one! When it arrived we met for coffee and set it up. Then spent a few hours on the Autozone parking lot doing my car no pressure and just fun. Later that night we messed around in his car and it was awesome. \n\nThen Covid-19 happened. He had to stay home and so we started Skyping every few days. Easily 4-6 hours a night. Deep, open, and honest communication. The hottest cyber sex you can imagine. Everything has been amazing. He continued the allowance even with the lock down. \n\nAs luck would have it, he also happens to be the textbook version of a perfect Dom. Always seeking to understand my comfort levels and keeping me right at the edge. Even more than just the sexual satisfaction, I love that he wants to help me be a better me! I have always had a hard time keeping up on housework and other aspects of \u201cadulting.\u201d His reminders, motivation, and praise have given me the push I needed. The tasks he assigns me are things that I should be doing or will aid in getting my life more together. He set up a google calendar \u201cdaily schedule\u201d for me that fits my life perfectly. It included a time for sewing and I started making corona masks. Sold 4 already and am like 0.0 \n\nThe thing that has really meant the most to me is the emotional support, dedication to being a safe space, and helping me process some past trauma. My ex was physically abusive (currently incarcerated for that.) My SD has never made me feel bad about being confused. Won\u2019t ever tell me what I should do. Just offers gentle suggestions and advice for either course of action. He went back to an abusive ex multiple times and completely understands the struggle between holding onto the hope of their promises of change and refusing to be treated disrespectfully. It\u2019s so nice to hear how much I\u2019m wanted for who I am. His late wife struggled with and ultimately succumbed to alcoholism. Not proud to admit that I was heading that same road. I didn\u2019t want to remind him of sad things so I cut back my drinking significantly and now it\u2019s less than 3 per week. \n\nI love knowing when I\u2019ve helped someone else out in any way. Once we were discussing my abuser and I mentioned how often I\u2019d write about the occasional good times just to keep the cognitive dissidence at bay. He thanked me for that information because it helped him understand something his late wife had done. She had all these journals and such with pages and pages about her ex but nothing about him. It was painful, as he always wondered why, and I feel so great that I helped him makes sense of it. \n\nNever thought I\u2019d find something like this on seeking. No matter what happens with the relationship, I\u2019m in a much better place than I was before he came into my life.",
