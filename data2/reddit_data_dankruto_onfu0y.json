We saw Madara and Kakashi get someone's eyes and didn't need to recover they used the eyes instantly. Also, the fact they're able to use both their own mangekyo powers and the person's eyes they took goes further into the theory. The pattern of the ems is a combination of both patterns of the MS. The picture I posted above was when Madara gained EMS after his brother gave him his eyes. Madara, when he died, gave Nagato his rinnegan and told Obito to act as him why didn't Obito used Madaras's old eyes to get EMS instead he had his MS and a normal Sharingan.\n\n[https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0](https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0)\n\nLook at timestamps 5:04 and 6:53\n\n[https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY](https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY)\n\nYeah, he took Itachi eyes and didn't implant them for a while he had the talk with Obito and then he took a few days off to recover from eyes. We saw Madara and Kakashi get someone's eyes and didn't need to recover they used the eyes instantly. Sasuke knew Itachi didn't trust Obito so why would he leave his old eyes with him. Idk if you read the boruto manga or not so im going to mark this as a spoiler >!When Boroshiki destroyed Sasuke rinnegan why wouldn't he just replace them with his old eyes.!<",

Sasuke has only used 2 of the rinnegan's abilities in Boruto. But coming back to naruto, obito couldn't take madara's eyes because they were in nagato and were no longer sharingans, they were rinnegans. \n\nAlso madara didn't just pop kakashi's sharigan(even though he totally did) in to his eyes socket, he used medical ninjutsu but I fail to see how that has anything at all to do with the ems. If you're talking about why kakashi's sharingan didn't become an eternal mangekyo while madara had it, I think that might have to do with them not being blood relatives as itachi stated was needed for the ems to awaken",

First of all , you have to set your expectations to zero only then you will be able to enjoy it sometimes . If you start watching it with high expectations you will not be able to ever watch it . I am watching Boruto without any expectations and I am finding it bearable as of now . Nothing special but watchable . Though , my only reason for watching as of now is I love Naruto (my favourite character in Naruto since Pain Arc ) and I am watching for whatever little action he is getting . Episode 204 was really good . The villains are nowhere near as interesting as Akatsuki . Most of them have really boring fighting styles and personalities . The only new character that I enjoy watching is Mitsuki . Sarada is ok too . I think I will continue watching the show until Naruto is dead and drop it after that if I dont find anything interesting to look forward too in it .",

Also, the fact they're able to use both their own mangekyo powers and the person's eyes they took goes further into the theory. The pattern of the ems is a combination of both patterns of the MS. The picture I posted above was when Madara gained EMS after his brother gave him his eyes. Madara, when he died, gave Nagato his rinnegan and told Obito to act as him why didn't Obito used Madaras's old eyes to get EMS instead he had his MS and a normal Sharingan.\n\n[https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0](https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0)\n\nLook at timestamps 5:04 and 6:53\n\n[https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY](https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY)\n\nYeah, he took Itachi eyes and didn't implant them for a while he had the talk with Obito and then he took a few days off to recover from eyes.

But coming back to naruto, obito couldn't take madara's eyes because they were in nagato and were no longer sharingans, they were rinnegans. \n\nAlso madara didn't just pop kakashi's sharigan(even though he totally did) in to his eyes socket, he used medical ninjutsu but I fail to see how that has anything at all to do with the ems. If you're talking about why kakashi's sharingan didn't become an eternal mangekyo while madara had it, I think that might have to do with them not being blood relatives as itachi stated was needed for the ems to awaken",

First of all , you have to set your expectations to zero only then you will be able to enjoy it sometimes . If you start watching it with high expectations you will not be able to ever watch it . I am watching Boruto without any expectations and I am finding it bearable as of now . Nothing special but watchable . Though , my only reason for watching as of now is I love Naruto (my favourite character in Naruto since Pain Arc ) and I am watching for whatever little action he is getting . Episode 204 was really good . The villains are nowhere near as interesting as Akatsuki . Most of them have really boring fighting styles and personalities . The only new character that I enjoy watching is Mitsuki . Sarada is ok too . I think I will continue watching the show until Naruto is dead and drop it after that if I dont find anything interesting to look forward too in it .",

Also, the fact they're able to use both their own mangekyo powers and the person's eyes they took goes further into the theory. The pattern of the ems is a combination of both patterns of the MS. The picture I posted above was when Madara gained EMS after his brother gave him his eyes. Madara, when he died, gave Nagato his rinnegan and told Obito to act as him why didn't Obito used Madaras's old eyes to get EMS instead he had his MS and a normal Sharingan.\n\n[https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0](https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0)\n\nLook at timestamps 5:04 and 6:53\n\n[https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY](https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY)\n\nYeah, he took Itachi eyes and didn't implant them for a while he had the talk with Obito and then he took a few days off to recover from eyes.

But coming back to naruto, obito couldn't take madara's eyes because they were in nagato and were no longer sharingans, they were rinnegans. \n\nAlso madara didn't just pop kakashi's sharigan(even though he totally did) in to his eyes socket, he used medical ninjutsu but I fail to see how that has anything at all to do with the ems. If you're talking about why kakashi's sharingan didn't become an eternal mangekyo while madara had it, I think that might have to do with them not being blood relatives as itachi stated was needed for the ems to awaken",

We saw Madara and Kakashi get someone's eyes and didn't need to recover they used the eyes instantly. Also, the fact they're able to use both their own mangekyo powers and the person's eyes they took goes further into the theory. The pattern of the ems is a combination of both patterns of the MS. The picture I posted above was when Madara gained EMS after his brother gave him his eyes. Madara, when he died, gave Nagato his rinnegan and told Obito to act as him why didn't Obito used Madaras's old eyes to get EMS instead he had his MS and a normal Sharingan.\n\n[https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0](https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0)\n\nLook at timestamps 5:04 and 6:53\n\n[https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY](https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY)\n\nYeah, he took Itachi eyes and didn't implant them for a while he had the talk with Obito and then he took a few days off to recover from eyes.

But coming back to naruto, obito couldn't take madara's eyes because they were in nagato and were no longer sharingans, they were rinnegans. \n\nAlso madara didn't just pop kakashi's sharigan(even though he totally did) in to his eyes socket, he used medical ninjutsu but I fail to see how that has anything at all to do with the ems. If you're talking about why kakashi's sharingan didn't become an eternal mangekyo while madara had it, I think that might have to do with them not being blood relatives as itachi stated was needed for the ems to awaken",

We saw Madara and Kakashi get someone's eyes and didn't need to recover they used the eyes instantly. Also, the fact they're able to use both their own mangekyo powers and the person's eyes they took goes further into the theory. The pattern of the ems is a combination of both patterns of the MS. The picture I posted above was when Madara gained EMS after his brother gave him his eyes. Madara, when he died, gave Nagato his rinnegan and told Obito to act as him why didn't Obito used Madaras's old eyes to get EMS instead he had his MS and a normal Sharingan.\n\n[https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0](https://youtu.be/QCnK-Bb7bG0)\n\nLook at timestamps 5:04 and 6:53\n\n[https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY](https://youtu.be/cl2QN6HRhMY)\n\nYeah, he took Itachi eyes and didn't implant them for a while he had the talk with Obito and then he took a few days off to recover from eyes.

But coming back to naruto, obito couldn't take madara's eyes because they were in nagato and were no longer sharingans, they were rinnegans. \n\nAlso madara didn't just pop kakashi's sharigan(even though he totally did) in to his eyes socket, he used medical ninjutsu but I fail to see how that has anything at all to do with the ems. If you're talking about why kakashi's sharingan didn't become an eternal mangekyo while madara had it, I think that might have to do with them not being blood relatives as itachi stated was needed for the ems to awaken",

If you're talking about why kakashi's sharingan didn't become an eternal mangekyo while madara had it, I think that might have to do with them not being blood relatives as itachi stated was needed for the ems to awaken",
