But at the end of the day, \"good hair\" isn't something that a lot of people have to begin with. \n\nThese guys started out with good hair, just lacking good styling. For many people, myself included, there is little I can do with my hair that doesn't require product (usually an inordinate amount of It's a 10 leave in). I stay away from heat, because my hair is so dry to begin with, heat is the last thing it needs, but was essentially all he used (plus water) to get these styles. \n\nAgain, I get it, but the video's title is a bit pretentious and a little offputting for people who try to work with what they've got, and product is how they get there.
