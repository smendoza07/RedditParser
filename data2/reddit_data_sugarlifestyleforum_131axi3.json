It's surprisingly a great way to filter. \n\nSDs, be fun, be fit, be charming, don't pressure her, don't be demanding, and it works out to be a more fun time, regardless of how much you spend, she cares about who you are the most.",

It's amazing how often raw is offered after a woman is comfortable with you, has been intimate a couple times. I never understand all these guys asking or demanding. Ive never asked, and probably 2 out of 3 SB if theyre looking for just 1 consistent SD and dont have a BF, will typically want to go raw if they like you, trust you, and you make them feel comfortable.",

I'm sure they have many of their canned responses copied down somewhere ready to paste as soon as tangentially relevant. \n\nI don't tend to place much faith in those sort of comments. Everyone has an agenda, but some posters are clearly vying for upvotes/popularity rather than promoting any sort of realistic perception of real world sugaring. And it's common knowledge that promoting certain perspectives in this community gets far more support than others. It just isn't beneficial to someone actually trying to learn what sugaring is like. \n\nIt's a classic normative/descriptive problem. But trying to shape sugar norms through this subreddit is like trying to change the pH of the ocean with a gallon of acid. We can educate and engage with the people in our small slice, but it's far better to acknowledge that this isn't how things are in the bigger ocean, but rather how we think things ought to be and how we can work to change things for the better. \n\nThe current strategy seems to be lying to newbies in the hopes they'll think that's how sugaring really is. But the problem with that is as soon as they set foot in the real world they realize they've been lied to or feel they're some crazy outlier and wonder what's wrong with them. When nothing is wrong with them at all.",

Blacklists are no panacea. \n\nBlacklists are one tool that can potentially help keep people safe if used correctly. But the ones that primarily use numbers, this is most of them, aren't forcing anyone to 'resort' to sugaring to avoid blacklists. They just change their numbers use an app or burner phone and make up fake info. More robust screening results in better blacklists, but at the cost of less searchability unless a blacklisted person continues to use the same info to screen that got them blacklisted. This is obviously very rare as they usually change info after the 2nd or 3rd refusal. And the vast majority of people don't even check or contribute to blacklists in the first place. \n\nI have only met one SB in almost 6 years of sugaring that insisted on condoms in perpetuity. It is so exceptionally rare in real life that I get the feeling many users here are virtue signaling for one reason or another.

The term typically refers to the use of antiviral drugs as a strategy for the prevention of HIV/AIDS. PrEP is one of a number of HIV prevention strategies for people who are HIV negative but who have a higher risk of acquiring HIV, including sexually active adults at increased risk of contracting HIV, people who engage in intravenous drug use (see drug injection), and serodiscordant sexually active couples.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Case in point my previous. long-term SGR. We used condoms for the majority of our relationship, not because she was seeing other people, but because she didnt like birth control and got bad sides from it.

But the ones that primarily use numbers, this is most of them, aren't forcing anyone to 'resort' to sugaring to avoid blacklists. They just change their numbers use an app or burner phone and make up fake info. More robust screening results in better blacklists, but at the cost of less searchability unless a blacklisted person continues to use the same info to screen that got them blacklisted. This is obviously very rare as they usually change info after the 2nd or 3rd refusal. And the vast majority of people don't even check or contribute to blacklists in the first place. \n\nI have only met one SB in almost 6 years of sugaring that insisted on condoms in perpetuity. It is so exceptionally rare in real life that I get the feeling many users here are virtue signaling for one reason or another. Obviously we'd all be safer if we used condoms so it's commendable from a public health perspective at least.",
