    "body": "It takes years. Tons of patience. Dedication. Your family will maybe say you look horrible in the beginning stages, but women random on the streets years later will ask you how you make your hair do that. The answer is not caring, shampoo + condition 2 ttwice a week when showeing and let it air dry. How manyvproducts women use is astounding, I pay 80 bucks for tea tree shampoo and conditioner for twice a week and both bottles have lasted 3 years.  It sucks waking up at 545 or 600 AM  at winter when winds will freeze hair, but it's so worth it to be individial. A man confident in his own skin. And a 6 month beard to boot.",

It sucks for a minute but your hair cuticles will thank you. Cold water leaves hair feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Mine got greasy after a couple days at one point, i shampood once a week and took a 3 minute ice cold shower to rinse the hair and then too 15 minute hot showers lol",

They don't know shit but you do or at least you should be if you care about the health of your hair.\n\nWhen you hair become greasy after a day or two is no doubt good for your hair. It not a matter of debate. \nIt's fact. Human hair aren't suppose to be this greasyless until shampoo is invented by human.\n\nWhich is why many if not EVERYBODY (and I assure you it's everybody) who know how to take care of their hair health, hair doctor(if thats even a thing), health expert, youtuber hair health, hair health blog, one advice they gave you is shampoo your every one a 3 day or when you need it for example you got dirt within your hair, bird shit on top of your hair so on and just conditioner every day instead or not.\n\nBut if you really that insecure about your greasy shiny hair, go ahead. Shampoo everyday, be ignorant by choice with other ignorant people.\n\nIf you ask why shampoo company didn't tell their consumer about this advice is because of marketing. \nShampoo everyday, shampoo will be empty quicker. Consumer have to buy their product more than they need to in their lifetime.",

If you have a very oily hair or very fine hair you should shampoo more frequently.  That is, if you don't want oily hair.

In some cases it is shampoo every day. This is stated by experts, as I said and quoted. If you avoid shampoo you probably will have a very unpleasant look, in terms of hair, and you can aggravate cases of acne, oily skin, itchy scalp and, in some rare cases, more serious conditions. \n\nI can give you my example. I have a full head of hair, I'm not balding, etc. However, my hair is very fine and oily. I have to go regularly to a dermatologist because of a skin condition, which I have since I was born.

I don't have dandruff  or any scalp issues apart from getting oily after a day or two of not shower/shampooing. I know my hair gets oily after a couple days because following a Friday night after I had too much to drink, I'll stay home to recouperate and findy hair oily on Sunday after not having done shit all weekend.\n\nI think people should do what works for them. I'm 40, have a full head of hair, no scalp issues and my hair is pretty healthy looking. I know shampooing twice a day is pretty weird to folks and maybe I can cut out the morning shampoo since I dont have any product in my hair overnight. It's just something I do out of habit and it feels weird to change it up.",

I use a clarifying shampoo about once a month to once every two weeks vo5, but be careful not to use it more often than that because this is meant to basically just restart you hair in case it gets to be overwhelming at first or if you're just starting out. The sulfates are not good for your hair, BUT are essential if you want to flush out any bad shit from you mane before just committing mostly to a conditioner only wash.\n\nThe conditioner I use is tresemme botanique nourish and replenish conditioner because it doesn't have any silicones, which by the way can be largely why your hair is greasy. The switchover can seem overwhelming at first, but try not give in to washing out anything too soon because over time, your hair will not be as greasy as frequently, and pretty soon, mostly not at all.\n\nI recommend a wrapping your head in a microfiber towel (NOT RUBBING) if just plain airdrying isn't really your thing, or if you want to blow dry, that's when it gets to be a bit more expensive, but if you have a cream or leave in conditioner in your hair, it can set your hair quite nicely, just make sure it's low or no heat and having a diffuser can help, especially for curly/wavy long hair.\n\nDon't give in to the awkward stages, but at the same time, don't think that your hair doesn't need to be touched up every now and again. As your hair grows out, you'll find that not each section grows consistently, and once it reaches a certain point, it can look like a trapezoid or just weird around the edges an occasional \"reshaping\" at a salon can make your relaxed hair fall into a more flattering shape, plus, if you have a problem with split ends, or are just prone to it, a slight trim can really revitalize the hair.\n\nTangles are going to be a fucking BITCH especially if you aren't planning on combing your hair regularly (again, referencing my fellow curly-haired/wavy-haired gentlemen here), so make sure to detangle in the shower (which should be in cold or just below lukewarm water BTW because hot water makes your hair frizzy. I always apply the conditioner to my hair and then detangle with my fingers or a widetooth comb. Then I style my hair there, combing it how I want so I don't have to worry about fucking things up outside the shower.",

It not a matter of debate. \nIt's fact. Human hair aren't suppose to be this greasyless until shampoo is invented by human.\n\nWhich is why many if not EVERYBODY (and I assure you it's everybody) who know how to take care of their hair health, hair doctor(if thats even a thing), health expert, youtuber hair health, hair health blog, one advice they gave you is shampoo your every one a 3 day or when you need it for example you got dirt within your hair, bird shit on top of your hair so on and just conditioner every day instead or not.\n\nBut if you really that insecure about your greasy shiny hair, go ahead. Shampoo everyday, be ignorant by choice with other ignorant people.\n\nIf you ask why shampoo company didn't tell their consumer about this advice is because of marketing. \nShampoo everyday, shampoo will be empty quicker. Consumer have to buy their product more than they need to in their lifetime.",

If you shampoo every day you will produce more oil and you can cause itchy scalp and dandruff.\n\nHowever, if you have oily hair and scalp and very fine hair, you should shampoo more frequently and find your regimen. In some cases it is shampoo every day. This is stated by experts, as I said and quoted. If you avoid shampoo you probably will have a very unpleasant look, in terms of hair, and you can aggravate cases of acne, oily skin, itchy scalp and, in some rare cases, more serious conditions. \n\nI can give you my example. I have a full head of hair, I'm not balding, etc. However, my hair is very fine and oily. I have to go regularly to a dermatologist because of a skin condition, which I have since I was born. However, I was speaking with him about my hair and he stated the same: I need to shampoo more frequently, a lot of times I need to shampoo every day.\n\nNow, you should buy a correct shampoo. You should research the ingredients and avoid shampoos with silicone",

I'm 40, have a full head of hair, no scalp issues and my hair is pretty healthy looking. I know shampooing twice a day is pretty weird to folks and maybe I can cut out the morning shampoo since I dont have any product in my hair overnight.

Human hair aren't suppose to be this greasyless until shampoo is invented by human.\n\nWhich is why many if not EVERYBODY (and I assure you it's everybody) who know how to take care of their hair health, hair doctor(if thats even a thing), health expert, youtuber hair health, hair health blog, one advice they gave you is shampoo your every one a 3 day or when you need it for example you got dirt within your hair, bird shit on top of your hair so on and just conditioner every day instead or not.\n\nBut if you really that insecure about your greasy shiny hair, go ahead. Shampoo everyday, be ignorant by choice with other ignorant people.\n\nIf you ask why shampoo company didn't tell their consumer about this advice is because of marketing. \nShampoo everyday, shampoo will be empty quicker. Consumer have to buy their product more than they need to in their lifetime.",

If you have a very oily hair or very fine hair you should shampoo more frequently.  That is, if you don't want oily hair. You should know your hair and act accordingly because you can't apply every hair regimen to every single person.\n\nAnd I don't get why using shampoo makes you a \"guido\" (?)",

In some cases it is shampoo every day. This is stated by experts, as I said and quoted. If you avoid shampoo you probably will have a very unpleasant look, in terms of hair, and you can aggravate cases of acne, oily skin, itchy scalp and, in some rare cases, more serious conditions. \n\nI can give you my example. I have a full head of hair, I'm not balding, etc. However, my hair is very fine and oily. I have to go regularly to a dermatologist because of a skin condition, which I have since I was born.

Shampoo everyday, be ignorant by choice with other ignorant people.\n\nIf you ask why shampoo company didn't tell their consumer about this advice is because of marketing. \nShampoo everyday, shampoo will be empty quicker.

In some cases it is shampoo every day. This is stated by experts, as I said and quoted. If you avoid shampoo you probably will have a very unpleasant look, in terms of hair, and you can aggravate cases of acne, oily skin, itchy scalp and, in some rare cases, more serious conditions. \n\nI can give you my example. I have a full head of hair, I'm not balding, etc. However, my hair is very fine and oily. I have to go regularly to a dermatologist because of a skin condition, which I have since I was born. However, I was speaking with him about my hair and he stated the same: I need to shampoo more frequently, a lot of times I need to shampoo every day.\n\nNow, you should buy a correct shampoo. You should research the ingredients and avoid shampoos with silicone",

If you shampoo every day you will produce more oil and you can cause itchy scalp and dandruff.\n\nHowever, if you have oily hair and scalp and very fine hair, you should shampoo more frequently and find your regimen. In some cases it is shampoo every day. This is stated by experts, as I said and quoted. If you avoid shampoo you probably will have a very unpleasant look, in terms of hair, and you can aggravate cases of acne, oily skin, itchy scalp and, in some rare cases, more serious conditions. \n\nI can give you my example. I have a full head of hair, I'm not balding, etc. However, my hair is very fine and oily. I have to go regularly to a dermatologist because of a skin condition, which I have since I was born. However, I was speaking with him about my hair and he stated the same: I need to shampoo more frequently, a lot of times I need to shampoo every day.\n\nNow, you should buy a correct shampoo. You should research the ingredients and avoid shampoos with silicone",

I'm 40, have a full head of hair, no scalp issues and my hair is pretty healthy looking.

If you shampoo every day you will produce more oil and you can cause itchy scalp and dandruff.\n\nHowever, if you have oily hair and scalp and very fine hair, you should shampoo more frequently and find your regimen. In some cases it is shampoo every day. This is stated by experts, as I said and quoted. If you avoid shampoo you probably will have a very unpleasant look, in terms of hair, and you can aggravate cases of acne, oily skin, itchy scalp and, in some rare cases, more serious conditions. \n\nI can give you my example. I have a full head of hair, I'm not balding, etc. However, my hair is very fine and oily. I have to go regularly to a dermatologist because of a skin condition, which I have since I was born. However, I was speaking with him about my hair and he stated the same: I need to shampoo more frequently, a lot of times I need to shampoo every day.\n\nNow, you should buy a correct shampoo. You should research the ingredients and avoid shampoos with silicone",

I'm 40, have a full head of hair, no scalp issues and my hair is pretty healthy looking. I know shampooing twice a day is pretty weird to folks and maybe I can cut out the morning shampoo since I dont have any product in my hair overnight.

Maybe that's due to the fact that I have been doing it like this for 40 years, but I can't imagine not doing it. Also, I use several different wax products  in my hair (depending on the style I want to do it and the length at the time) so if I don't wash daily using shampoo, I imagine it would be difficult to keep my hair clear of residual wax as well.\n\nI know that shampooing twice a day is a bit overboard, and maybe it's due to the fact that I've been doing it so long, but I love the way it feels after a shampoo.",

I know my hair gets oily after a couple days because following a Friday night after I had too much to drink, I'll stay home to recouperate and findy hair oily on Sunday after not having done shit all weekend.\n\nI think people should do what works for them. I'm 40, have a full head of hair, no scalp issues and my hair is pretty healthy looking. I know shampooing twice a day is pretty weird to folks and maybe I can cut out the morning shampoo since I dont have any product in my hair overnight. It's just something I do out of habit and it feels weird to change it up.",
