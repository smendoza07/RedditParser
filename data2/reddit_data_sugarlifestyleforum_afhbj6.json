    "body": "There's so many people on this sub who are triggered by this simple idea that an SB knows her own worth.\n\nWhy would an SD (any man for that matter) have a problem with that? \nSimple: if a girl knows her worth (knowing what she can accepts in matters of her own body and mind), she can't be exploited or taken advantage of. A lot of users wouldn't be happy about that. \n\n\nSo it is perfectly fine:\n\n- To know exactly how and how much you want and stick to it (no you do not have to negotiate to accommodate an SD if you don't want to). \nYour body/time/attention are commodities only You can put a price and no one can discuss that. They can either afford you or not. \n\n- To state your physical and emotional boundaries. Yes it is a relationship to a certain degree, but not quite. You're not a wife, you're not a girlfriend so if some of that extra emotional and physical \"labor\"  does not sit well with what You can accept (for your body's and mind well-being) it is okay to say no. \n\nMen on this sub are always quick to says that SBs outnumbers SDs on SA, implying that you must be accommodating or get shelved. SA is not the only place to find a SD, everywhere older men have been lusting on younger women and tried to gain their favor since forever. You can always find someone who will meet your needs. \n\nA rich guy losing some money is not the same damages as a girl being used, manipulated into sharing her body on someone else's terms. \n",

            "body": "The problem with the discussion is the assumption that  this SB , what she visions for a relationship and the market are all definable and knowable. \n\nProblem 1 - The \"value\" of an sb to an SD is not definable as a fungible commodity. Feeble attempts are made to sort them into appearance scales that are usually relevant only to the individual or perhaps movie producers but not to the vast majority of SD.  \n\nWhy?  because other than sensuality and economic benefits, the people, the match, the compatibility all introduce too many factors.  The SB \"value\" is individual to the SD and vise versa, the value of an allowance is, in most relationships, reflective of what the SD brings (both positive and negative) to the equation. \n\nToo many SB's lose both opportunities and $ because the are promoting sugar relationships as if they were a fungible commodity rather than focusing on what's special about them and has value to a specific SD.......... \n\narm candy  v  brain candy and comfortable in wide range of social situations \n\nlooking for just a minimal sugar relationship v sugar with genuine friendship \n\ninterests both to share   and desire to be exposed to \n\nTo me the statement \"I know my worth\" in a profile or initial communication says I'm offering a commodity. \n\nThe one who writes a profile that's designed to appeal to the corner of the SD universe where she is likely to find the most compatible prospects because they have both the capacity to meet her expectations and realize that she is not a commodity is most likely to be far happier and successful in sugaring - financially, emotionally and with longer relationships. \n\nThat leads to the last point....... know the worth of your loss of sugar due to short term relationships.  A great allowance for 2 months and then 4 months of searching is not success. \n\nIt's fine to use allowance for an early screen or even self screen.....  A line at the bottom of :What I am looking for  to the effect    \n\n\n\"\"In your initial communication please confirm that you have read my profile, are seriously interested in a long term relationship and are comfortable with an allowance in what was formerly called the moderate level.\n\n\n\n",

But if someone goes around saying \"MAGA!\", we all know that they have a particular political perspective, beyond the words \"make america great again\".  And if you have the opposite perspective, \"MAGA!\" is a pretty good tipoff that that person's political views won't be aligned with yours -- even though we all want to make America great.\n\nAs someone else pointed out, \"I don't want things to feel transactional\" is probably something we all feel.  I mean, who wants an SR to feel transactional?  But we know through a zillion stories that SDs who open with this, are often using that phrase to manipulate an SB -- it means \"I don't want to pay allowance, that feels transactional, I'll just buy you gifts / pay bills /etc.\"  SBs are absolutely justified in expressing caution when they hear this phrase, the men who say it aren't always the most awesome SDs.  I don't want things to feel transactional, but I show that through I interact with my SB.\n\nWhen it comes to \"know my worth\", nearly all high quality SDs want a woman who has high self esteem, high emotional IQ, is confident and secure in who she is.  In other words, I sure want a woman who knows her worth -- from painful experience, having an SR with a low-self-esteem low-EQ person is... not fun.  But those high-EQ women do not going around saying \"I know my worth\", they show it through their actions and the way they carry themselves.    That said, SDs have learned that, just like an SD saying \"don't want it to feel transactional\", an SB saying \"I know my worth\" has often learned that phrase through the most toxic zero-sum-game tumblrs and the like, and may well have been radicalized to be like those bitter toxic \"SBs\".  We are well justified in avoiding women who say those things -- they are the absolute most horrible miserable people in general.  But I still want a secure, confident, happy SB.  I think **some** of the SBs on this thread would be welll-served by wearing their beliefs like a badget -- put \"I know my worth\" in your profiles, it's communicating accurately exactly what kind of person you are.\n\nNo surprise this thread is toxic.  I continue to believe -- no, KNOW through experience -- a win/win SR in which both people feel appreciated and valued is the right way for me.  And I'll search out SBs who feel the same, who are not toxic and bitter or horrible people at heart, and will build great SRs with them.  I'll leave the divisive, adverserial people on both sides of the aisle to go do their toxic thing without me.  ",

Knowing your worth is not the same as saying \"I know my worth\". From what we've seen, potential SBs who run around saying it are not worth the time.

Similarly, I think i'm worth $10M per minute just to hang out and talk in the office. No one has been willing to give me that so i'm unemployed. I have 2 options, stay unemployed or eventually give in. I won't settle for being paid less than i'm worth, all my potential employers are nuts.",

You can start off with a low PPM and it can grow over time. You get more with long term like a SD buying you stocks and putting you on his life insurance. I\u2019ve had both. I\u2019ve found that high allowances usually don\u2019t last that long then you gotta go back out there telling everybody that you know your worth. I don\u2019t know if that is successful. ",

I want  to do things on weekends. So one was \"worth\" less to me.  If an SD was restricted to weekdays , that SB had more \"worth\" to him. \n\nSay your putting together a cute outfit based on blue colors.  You see cool shoes but they only come in orange., Their \"worth\" to you is low. The SB creating a fall look with orange and browns, might think they're perfect.  They have a different worth to her then you even if you both can afford them. \n\nIMHO:  \"They can either afford you or not.\", sure it can be true but not 100% of the time. ",

We understand each other and my goals in life. \n\nEven though I don\u2019t NEED the money, it definitely helps with school tuition and bills so I\u2019m not stressed about working extra hours to stay ahead.

As the M&G progressed it was clear to me that my wallet wanted to be free and open to those amazing ladies and I was willing to go the extra mile.\n\nI have been in SRs where the SB was so much fun that it was not difficult for me to decide that I needed to do something extra for her. That is how they define their worth \u2014- by being awesome and rare. \n\nAnd last night I was at an M&G. Woman was 4 or 5. I had zero attraction to her. As the convo progressed she pushes me to take her home and start an arrangement. I am like what\u2019s the ppm. She quotes a very high amount and in my mind is not even worth 50% of it. If that. I politely decline. She clearly was clueless and the last thing I want to do is piss of my wallet which can never open up to that level of quality.",

Using sugar to get back at all the average looking women who turned you down for not looking like Brad Pitt is not attractive in the least and your response comes across that way. I have seen 38 yr old women with 4 kids who are 10 times hotter than a fit 27 yr old. Of course, they are the exception,  not the rule. I get that. I'm 34, about to be 35 , have 3 kids, just because one SD doesn't like it, doesn't mean there aren't ones that don't. The ones that don't like it obviously are not for me. I don't want a SD who thinks I'm not worth it because I'm older and a mother. For me, being older and mother are two of my best qualities. \n\nRemember the human, always. ",

You are absolutely right in that your self-worth is determined by you and you alone, and there are many women who wouldn't even think of dipping a toe into the sugar bowl no matter how much it paid.  But on the flip side, your 'market value' is not determined by you, it is determined by the market, and that means the men.  When the two are on the same level, great; if not, lots of personal feelings will come in where the SB will feel the men are not valuing their 'self-worth' and the SD will feel the women are overvaluing their 'market worth'.  Immature specimens on both sides will respond negatively as a result.\n\nPersonally, I 'next' profiles who talk about 'I know my own worth', for reasons others have stated.",

Even in a so called SR a lot of SBs really act like hookers with a money first mentality and have no real conversation skills other then lite bs. To me it\u2019s a turn-off when getting to know a SB and seeing she has nothing going for her other than chasing bills and a bunch of drama. So now I\u2019m prettying numb to all the SBs stating what their worth is and I know it really means what\u2019s most I can get from doing the least amount of work. I know the SBs are not going to agree but I know a lot women naturally do not want to sleep a bunch of men but do it out of necessity which kills the whole online SR experience for me. If a SB like sex it shows and it feel like she is \u201cworking\u201d for the money. I think you get what you ask for when your worth is only monetary and that is negotiations. ",

I think many SD would prefer it like that way then to PPM based arrangements that Seeking has created. The problem is the new internet generation of most SB look at SR like they are only about the money and nothing about the sugar relationship.  That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",

Similarly, I think i'm worth $10M per minute just to hang out and talk in the office. No one has been willing to give me that so i'm unemployed. I have 2 options, stay unemployed or eventually give in. I won't settle for being paid less than i'm worth, all my potential employers are nuts.",

I\u2019m not in a position where I can vanilla date with my school, Clincal and work. Even in vanilla I date older men. I wouldn\u2019t vanilla date a married man but in sugar it\u2019s ok I guess. Every sugar relationship I\u2019ve had have all been great friendships and still are. We understand each other and my goals in life. \n\nEven though I don\u2019t NEED the money, it definitely helps with school tuition and bills so I\u2019m not stressed about working extra hours to stay ahead. Saying this I would still have to turn down a low PPM. The PPM in my area is not as high as NY, LA, SF. ",

You're delusional and getting butthurt when we won't agree with you. ",

Like someone said,  at the end of the day , we are all human beings. Using sugar to get back at all the average looking women who turned you down for not looking like Brad Pitt is not attractive in the least and your response comes across that way. I have seen 38 yr old women with 4 kids who are 10 times hotter than a fit 27 yr old. Of course, they are the exception,  not the rule. I get that. I'm 34, about to be 35 , have 3 kids, just because one SD doesn't like it, doesn't mean there aren't ones that don't. The ones that don't like it obviously are not for me. I don't want a SD who thinks I'm not worth it because I'm older and a mother. For me, being older and mother are two of my best qualities. \n\nRemember the human, always. ",

You are absolutely right in that your self-worth is determined by you and you alone, and there are many women who wouldn't even think of dipping a toe into the sugar bowl no matter how much it paid.  But on the flip side, your 'market value' is not determined by you, it is determined by the market, and that means the men.  When the two are on the same level, great; if not, lots of personal feelings will come in where the SB will feel the men are not valuing their 'self-worth' and the SD will feel the women are overvaluing their 'market worth'.  Immature specimens on both sides will respond negatively as a result.\n\nPersonally, I 'next' profiles who talk about 'I know my own worth', for reasons others have stated.",

He's also much more likely to spoil her before they get intimate, and most likely there isnt a ppm system in place.

I think many SD would prefer it like that way then to PPM based arrangements that Seeking has created.

That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",

Like someone said,  at the end of the day , we are all human beings. Using sugar to get back at all the average looking women who turned you down for not looking like Brad Pitt is not attractive in the least and your response comes across that way. I have seen 38 yr old women with 4 kids who are 10 times hotter than a fit 27 yr old. Of course, they are the exception,  not the rule. I get that. I'm 34, about to be 35 , have 3 kids, just because one SD doesn't like it, doesn't mean there aren't ones that don't. The ones that don't like it obviously are not for me. I don't want a SD who thinks I'm not worth it because I'm older and a mother. For me, being older and mother are two of my best qualities. \n\nRemember the human, always. ",

You are absolutely right in that your self-worth is determined by you and you alone, and there are many women who wouldn't even think of dipping a toe into the sugar bowl no matter how much it paid.  But on the flip side, your 'market value' is not determined by you, it is determined by the market, and that means the men.  When the two are on the same level, great; if not, lots of personal feelings will come in where the SB will feel the men are not valuing their 'self-worth' and the SD will feel the women are overvaluing their 'market worth'.  Immature specimens on both sides will respond negatively as a result.\n\nPersonally, I 'next' profiles who talk about 'I know my own worth', for reasons others have stated.",

He's also much more likely to spoil her before they get intimate, and most likely there isnt a ppm system in place.

I think many SD would prefer it like that way then to PPM based arrangements that Seeking has created. The problem is the new internet generation of most SB look at SR like they are only about the money and nothing about the sugar relationship.  That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",

If a girl was paid a high allowance once, even if for a short time, that now sets her \"worth\" in her mind. \n\nThe reality is that the number of SDs willing and able to pay large allowances are few conpared to the number of SBs that think they are worth a large allowance.

Like someone said,  at the end of the day , we are all human beings. Using sugar to get back at all the average looking women who turned you down for not looking like Brad Pitt is not attractive in the least and your response comes across that way. I have seen 38 yr old women with 4 kids who are 10 times hotter than a fit 27 yr old. Of course, they are the exception,  not the rule. I get that. I'm 34, about to be 35 , have 3 kids, just because one SD doesn't like it, doesn't mean there aren't ones that don't. The ones that don't like it obviously are not for me. I don't want a SD who thinks I'm not worth it because I'm older and a mother. For me, being older and mother are two of my best qualities. \n\nRemember the human, always. ",

I think many SD would prefer it like that way then to PPM based arrangements that Seeking has created. The problem is the new internet generation of most SB look at SR like they are only about the money and nothing about the sugar relationship.  That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",

You can\u2019t say \u201cThis isn\u2019t sex work because we care about each other\u201d, many sex workers care about their clients, and I think that mindset goes back to my point that people often try to dehumanize sex workers. \n\n> plenty of vanilla relationships are sex work too.\n\nThis is an unrelated topic.

Like someone said,  at the end of the day , we are all human beings. Using sugar to get back at all the average looking women who turned you down for not looking like Brad Pitt is not attractive in the least and your response comes across that way. I have seen 38 yr old women with 4 kids who are 10 times hotter than a fit 27 yr old. Of course, they are the exception,  not the rule. I get that. I'm 34, about to be 35 , have 3 kids, just because one SD doesn't like it, doesn't mean there aren't ones that don't. The ones that don't like it obviously are not for me. I don't want a SD who thinks I'm not worth it because I'm older and a mother. For me, being older and mother are two of my best qualities. \n\nRemember the human, always. ",

That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",

Like someone said,  at the end of the day , we are all human beings. Using sugar to get back at all the average looking women who turned you down for not looking like Brad Pitt is not attractive in the least and your response comes across that way. I have seen 38 yr old women with 4 kids who are 10 times hotter than a fit 27 yr old. Of course, they are the exception,  not the rule. I get that. I'm 34, about to be 35 , have 3 kids, just because one SD doesn't like it, doesn't mean there aren't ones that don't. The ones that don't like it obviously are not for me. I don't want a SD who thinks I'm not worth it because I'm older and a mother. For me, being older and mother are two of my best qualities. \n\nRemember the human, always. ",

I think many SD would prefer it like that way then to PPM based arrangements that Seeking has created.

That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",

The problem is the new internet generation of most SB look at SR like they are only about the money and nothing about the sugar relationship.  That\u2019s why you see so many posts on here about \u201cI know my worth\u201d or \u201cany SD that won\u2019t pay $XXXX per month is Salt/Splenda\u201d basically they just look at their SD like he\u2019s an ATM, and we are all interchangeable until the guy with the larger bank account comes along. This warped thinking really has fostered the whole John/Escort mentality that runs rampant on SA. Because all these women want to be paid for there services, and make the most for investing the least, this Attitude definitely  attracts many men that are looking to just pay for sex. So one thing leads to another, and now you have a sugar bowl full of escorts masquerading as SB, and Johns masquerading as SD. Leaving many who are looking for real SR frustrated. ",
