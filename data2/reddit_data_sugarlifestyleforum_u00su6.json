    "body": "You know those things that someone does because they think people find them attractive but it's actually instantly a red flag?\n\nMine is any man who calls himself an Alpha Male. Nope. Nope nope nope. Instant block. I know they think it means big sexy strong rich man, but to me the second I hear that it instantly tells me \"Hey! I'm a misogynist! I also act like I'm better than everyone and putting other men down makes me feel better about myself because I'm secretly cripplingly insecure! Come get some ladies!\" \nI'm sure some guys started calling themselves alphas because they heard someone else do it and started doing it because they thought it sounded cool with no idea the connotation it actually has. But the alpha study was debunked anyway so the next time a guy tells me he's an alpha I'm going to respond by asking him what his fursona is. \n\nIn the same vein, calling women \"females\" both gramatically incorrect and an asshole thing to do.\n\nEdit: Some of you guys are missing the point \ud83d\ude05 Not saying leaders in any group do not exist. I'm talking about the very specific connotation the words \"Alpha Male\" have when it comes to men talking about how they're an Alpha Male. It's not misogynistic to be a leader but that term specifically was popularized by and is heavily used by a group of men that really likes to push a very misogynistic ideology.\nIf you want to disagree with me and fight to use that term, that's your prerogative, but I'm just letting you know saying you're an Alpha Male sends a very specific message to most women in my generation and I don't think it's the message you want to send. But if you want to ignore me then you do you, just don't be surprised if you get blocked.",

Healthy, happy people don't usually drive themselves twice as hard as everyone else around them. Workaholics are driven by anxiety. Real life works a lot like high school. The most insecure people you went to high school with were probably the captain of the football team and the prom queen.",

The past is nobody's business.  It should be a green flag.  'Hey, someone that has been here, done that, and that will make things easier.'  But, its usually a step towards manipulation or shaming. \n\nIf an SB says she is experienced, eventually she will say things like \"my prior SDs always send me cash before meeting; that's how its done\" or \"I always get paid for the first date\" or \"my past SDs never mentioned sex.\"  For SDs, \"I am experienced and I always pay at the end of the month.\"",

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

It's a privilege to grow old, after all) and also signals that he is someone who sees himself as \"above\" the typical arrangement setup (i.e. he probably also doesn't want to gift cash allowance, etc.). It also makes me think he's possibly jealous that older men are more wealthy and can afford better SB than him. It also ignores the irony that they themselves are on the site, so by their own logic, aren't they also \"old desperate sorry losers\"? Just not a good look - but it's great when it's there bc it tells me who I need to block lol",

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

Never said men can't be charming. What I'm saying is that term has a very specific meaning and is popularized by a very specific group of people, and if you use it, that sends a very clear and specific message to the majority of women in my generation, because of the group of people that term is associated with. \nIf you want to keep using it anyway then go for it, just don't be surprised if a lot of 18-30 year old women are immediately turned off by it. \n\nYour argument here is basically the same as if I walked around calling myself a lesbian and then said someone was wrong for saying that most people associate that term with being a homosexual woman, and crazy for thinking it means that, because there are definitely people from the island of Lesbos in Greece who are called Lesbians so that's what that word means and anyone who thinks it means anything else is wrong.",

It tells about how wolves don\u2019t have alphas because they operate in family units. \n\nMy statements come from the point of view of someone who has been breeding horses for 15 years and has two degrees in cognitive-behavioural and environmental psychology - and who worked in team environments for over 25 years. \n\nI agree we are talking about different interpretations of alpha males. \n\nBut you seem to me to be talking about jerks exist claiming to be alphas which therefore proves that the whole concept isn\u2019t real. \n\nI\u2019m saying the concept does indeed exists and is an integral part of society and that jerks do claim to be alphas when they aren\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not even claiming to be an alpha male. I\u2019m certainly not. I lack the ability to relate to other males or care that much about group dynamics as a whole. I\u2019m much too introverted.  But I certainly acknowledge there are people out there who are inspiring and at the top of the social pyramid and usually lead whatever social group they are in. \nThose are alphas. \n\nJust because popular culture takes over a terms and bastardises it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the new reality.

That sounds like a you problem and I'm not going to continue discussing this with you because you're arguing an entirely different argument and missing the point by about 3 lightyears.\n\nFor the third time, I am not denying the existence of leaders in any social group, I am talking about the connotation that term has amongst most people today. Again. I am not denying there can be a social pyramid.

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

Never said men can't be charming. What I'm saying is that term has a very specific meaning and is popularized by a very specific group of people, and if you use it, that sends a very clear and specific message to the majority of women in my generation, because of the group of people that term is associated with. \nIf you want to keep using it anyway then go for it, just don't be surprised if a lot of 18-30 year old women are immediately turned off by it. \n\nYour argument here is basically the same as if I walked around calling myself a lesbian and then said someone was wrong for saying that most people associate that term with being a homosexual woman, and crazy for thinking it means that, because there are definitely people from the island of Lesbos in Greece who are called Lesbians so that's what that word means and anyone who thinks it means anything else is wrong.",

It tells about how wolves don\u2019t have alphas because they operate in family units. \n\nMy statements come from the point of view of someone who has been breeding horses for 15 years and has two degrees in cognitive-behavioural and environmental psychology - and who worked in team environments for over 25 years. \n\nI agree we are talking about different interpretations of alpha males. \n\nBut you seem to me to be talking about jerks exist claiming to be alphas which therefore proves that the whole concept isn\u2019t real. \n\nI\u2019m saying the concept does indeed exists and is an integral part of society and that jerks do claim to be alphas when they aren\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not even claiming to be an alpha male. I\u2019m certainly not. I lack the ability to relate to other males or care that much about group dynamics as a whole. I\u2019m much too introverted.  But I certainly acknowledge there are people out there who are inspiring and at the top of the social pyramid and usually lead whatever social group they are in. \nThose are alphas. \n\nJust because popular culture takes over a terms and bastardises it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the new reality.  If that were true then sugar babes and cam-girls would be the same thing, and onlyfans members would be sugar daddies.",

That sounds like a you problem and I'm not going to continue discussing this with you because you're arguing an entirely different argument and missing the point by about 3 lightyears.\n\nFor the third time, I am not denying the existence of leaders in any social group, I am talking about the connotation that term has amongst most people today.

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

Never said men can't be charming. What I'm saying is that term has a very specific meaning and is popularized by a very specific group of people, and if you use it, that sends a very clear and specific message to the majority of women in my generation, because of the group of people that term is associated with. \nIf you want to keep using it anyway then go for it, just don't be surprised if a lot of 18-30 year old women are immediately turned off by it. \n\nYour argument here is basically the same as if I walked around calling myself a lesbian and then said someone was wrong for saying that most people associate that term with being a homosexual woman, and crazy for thinking it means that, because there are definitely people from the island of Lesbos in Greece who are called Lesbians so that's what that word means and anyone who thinks it means anything else is wrong.",

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

Never said men can't be charming. What I'm saying is that term has a very specific meaning and is popularized by a very specific group of people, and if you use it, that sends a very clear and specific message to the majority of women in my generation, because of the group of people that term is associated with. \nIf you want to keep using it anyway then go for it, just don't be surprised if a lot of 18-30 year old women are immediately turned off by it. \n\nYour argument here is basically the same as if I walked around calling myself a lesbian and then said someone was wrong for saying that most people associate that term with being a homosexual woman, and crazy for thinking it means that, because there are definitely people from the island of Lesbos in Greece who are called Lesbians so that's what that word means and anyone who thinks it means anything else is wrong.",

I\u2019m certainly not. I lack the ability to relate to other males or care that much about group dynamics as a whole. I\u2019m much too introverted.

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

Never said men can't be charming. What I'm saying is that term has a very specific meaning and is popularized by a very specific group of people, and if you use it, that sends a very clear and specific message to the majority of women in my generation, because of the group of people that term is associated with. \nIf you want to keep using it anyway then go for it, just don't be surprised if a lot of 18-30 year old women are immediately turned off by it. \n\nYour argument here is basically the same as if I walked around calling myself a lesbian and then said someone was wrong for saying that most people associate that term with being a homosexual woman, and crazy for thinking it means that, because there are definitely people from the island of Lesbos in Greece who are called Lesbians so that's what that word means and anyone who thinks it means anything else is wrong.",

I\u2019m certainly not. I lack the ability to relate to other males or care that much about group dynamics as a whole. I\u2019m much too introverted.  But I certainly acknowledge there are people out there who are inspiring and at the top of the social pyramid and usually lead whatever social group they are in. \nThose are alphas. \n\nJust because popular culture takes over a terms and bastardises it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the new reality.

That sounds like a you problem and I'm not going to continue discussing this with you because you're arguing an entirely different argument and missing the point by about 3 lightyears.\n\nFor the third time, I am not denying the existence of leaders in any social group, I am talking about the connotation that term has amongst most people today.

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

I\u2019m certainly not. I lack the ability to relate to other males or care that much about group dynamics as a whole. I\u2019m much too introverted.  But I certainly acknowledge there are people out there who are inspiring and at the top of the social pyramid and usually lead whatever social group they are in. \nThose are alphas. \n\nJust because popular culture takes over a terms and bastardises it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the new reality.

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",

The paradox of women\u2019s declining relative well\u2010 being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well\u2010being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well\u2010being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging\u2014one with higher subjective well\u2010being for men.\n\nWomen getting more education and more responsibility (stress) outside the home has harmed their happiness while men, no longer forced to be the sole breadwinner, are happier.",
