    "body": "Throwaway because reasons. \n\nI've been with my SD about 3 months. He gives a below average PPM for my area but he is also young. \n\nI've been on time, dressed up for, chirpy and communicative for all of our previous dates. \n\nI told him in advance that if I got a call on this date (update on my sister's operation) I would have to take it and offered to reschedule at his convenience if this would be a big deal. I never take calls on dates otherwise and don't text. \n\nHe insisted as usual on meeting me at and taking me from my place and told me it was no problem if I had to take a call. But it happened almost as soon as he got there to pick me up, and for some reasons he got really angry. I offered him a drink in the kitchen, and went upstairs to talk on the phone taking about 10 minutes. \n\nWhen I got back, he was in the process of ejaculating into the milk jug. And I just don't get it??? I didn't know how to react and he said something I don't remember and then he left. I also have roommates and sometimes share food and drink with them. I don't understand why he would do that and I find it really gross even though we have sex.",

While it may not change your next actions, it should hopefully help you he more informed for the next guy.\n\n> I feel like the police would laugh in my face and then maybe arrest me for being an SB\n\nI dont know what kind of relationship you have, but if you follow the advice of this sub, being a SB is not illegal and even if it was, that doesn't mean men are free to commit crimes against you. Unfortunately a lot of women either don't realize this or haven't internalized it. This is (one of the reasons) why prostitutes are such common victims of crime. They're less likely to report it.\n\n> t's not against the law to ejaculate into a milk jug\n\nI'm assuming this was a milk jug that still had unexpired milk in it. Rather than explain why what he did is illegal, I'll change the scenario a little: is it illegal for a guy to trick a stranger into eating his semen? Don't answer until you read the final point.\n\n> we were already having sex\n\nThis does not matter and has no baring on if what he did is criminal or not. You don't have to ever talk to the police, but I encourage you to seek out resources for victims of sexual abuse  especially any that focus on intimate partner sexual abuse. You DO NOT need to tell them you are a SB. It's irrelevant and they won't ask anyway. I'm not familiar with any resources that I can vouch for, but I hope someone can come along and do so. \n\nI do think it is important that I be realistic though. What I am about to say changes nothing above though. The fact that you are having sex and he comes from money will make any criminal case very difficult on you. I understand completely why you would not want to go to the police. I still think an anonymous tip off to his family, wife, or employer would be in order though.",

I mean I can legally jizz into my own milk, but in general it's likely not legal where you are to trick someone into consuming your semen. How explicit the law is varies from state to state though.\n\n\n[This guy jizzed in his coworkers coffee](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/04/02/man-pleads-guilty-to-ejaculating-into-co-workers-coffee/).\n\n\nHe was later arrested, but due to the wording of the law they weren't able to charge him with a felony. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor and got 45 days in jail. The day he was sentenced also happened to be the day the Governor signed into law an updated definition of felonious sexual assault that included slipping semen into an unwitting person's food or drink.",

Like, no lie, didn\u2019t expect it, I anticipated \u201cgross\u201d to mean he just didn\u2019t have proper manners, not \u201ccum in my breakfast cereal.\u201d It\u2019s been said before, but there is a valid argument to be made that it\u2019s sexual assault to cum into a jug of milk. I\u2019m not really going to comment on that, but it is an argument to be made.\n\nI would ditch him, because he obviously doesn\u2019t care about the boundaries you\u2019ve placed (or even boundaries you didn\u2019t think you had to place) or the terms he agreed to beforehand.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say this is an absolute deal-breaker for you. I can\u2019t stand in for your specific lines.\n\nCouple huge (HUGE) \u201cif\u201d statements here. If you\u2019ve spoken in the past about \u201crisky\u201d or \u201ctaboo\u201d sexual behaviors and he\u2019s been understanding, and if (IF) cumming in/on food you eat is one of those things you\u2019ve tentatively been like \u201cokay\u2026\u201d to, there\u2019s a little more room for misunderstanding.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t talked about this brand of kink, it\u2019s alarming to say the least, violating at the mid-level, and horrifyingly criminal at the most extreme. Let me explain: if he was willing to walk into an apartment he may or may not have ever been in, open a jug of milk he may or may not know you drink from, and ejaculate into it, that\u2019s a lot of steps of deliberate choices. If this is his kink and it\u2019s the first you\u2019re learning about it (or worse, he told you and you were like \u201cnah, don\u2019t cum in/on my food\u201d) then that\u2019s borderline predatory; it leaves a question of whether he\u2019s done this before, has he taken cum on dates and (unbeknownst to you) put cum in your food while you were in the bathroom?\n\nA more nefarious read to this inclination is that, \u201cif he\u2019s willing to put his DNA/semen into a drink with the HOPE that you\u2019ll drink it, has he roofied anyone before and taken advantage of them?\u201d It is, unfortunately, easier to casually drop a pill in than to empty a used condom or vial of cum into a drink.",

While it may not change your next actions, it should hopefully help you he more informed for the next guy.\n\n> I feel like the police would laugh in my face and then maybe arrest me for being an SB\n\nI dont know what kind of relationship you have, but if you follow the advice of this sub, being a SB is not illegal and even if it was, that doesn't mean men are free to commit crimes against you. Unfortunately a lot of women either don't realize this or haven't internalized it. This is (one of the reasons) why prostitutes are such common victims of crime. They're less likely to report it.\n\n> t's not against the law to ejaculate into a milk jug\n\nI'm assuming this was a milk jug that still had unexpired milk in it. Rather than explain why what he did is illegal, I'll change the scenario a little: is it illegal for a guy to trick a stranger into eating his semen? Don't answer until you read the final point.\n\n> we were already having sex\n\nThis does not matter and has no baring on if what he did is criminal or not. You don't have to ever talk to the police, but I encourage you to seek out resources for victims of sexual abuse  especially any that focus on intimate partner sexual abuse. You DO NOT need to tell them you are a SB. It's irrelevant and they won't ask anyway. I'm not familiar with any resources that I can vouch for, but I hope someone can come along and do so. \n\nI do think it is important that I be realistic though. What I am about to say changes nothing above though. The fact that you are having sex and he comes from money will make any criminal case very difficult on you. I understand completely why you would not want to go to the police. I still think an anonymous tip off to his family, wife, or employer would be in order though.",

I mean I can legally jizz into my own milk, but in general it's likely not legal where you are to trick someone into consuming your semen. How explicit the law is varies from state to state though.\n\n\n[This guy jizzed in his coworkers coffee](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/04/02/man-pleads-guilty-to-ejaculating-into-co-workers-coffee/).\n\n\nHe was later arrested, but due to the wording of the law they weren't able to charge him with a felony. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor and got 45 days in jail. The day he was sentenced also happened to be the day the Governor signed into law an updated definition of felonious sexual assault that included slipping semen into an unwitting person's food or drink.",

While it may not change your next actions, it should hopefully help you he more informed for the next guy.\n\n> I feel like the police would laugh in my face and then maybe arrest me for being an SB\n\nI dont know what kind of relationship you have, but if you follow the advice of this sub, being a SB is not illegal and even if it was, that doesn't mean men are free to commit crimes against you. Unfortunately a lot of women either don't realize this or haven't internalized it. This is (one of the reasons) why prostitutes are such common victims of crime. They're less likely to report it.\n\n> t's not against the law to ejaculate into a milk jug\n\nI'm assuming this was a milk jug that still had unexpired milk in it. Rather than explain why what he did is illegal, I'll change the scenario a little: is it illegal for a guy to trick a stranger into eating his semen? Don't answer until you read the final point.\n\n> we were already having sex\n\nThis does not matter and has no baring on if what he did is criminal or not. You don't have to ever talk to the police, but I encourage you to seek out resources for victims of sexual abuse  especially any that focus on intimate partner sexual abuse. You DO NOT need to tell them you are a SB. It's irrelevant and they won't ask anyway. I'm not familiar with any resources that I can vouch for, but I hope someone can come along and do so. \n\nI do think it is important that I be realistic though. What I am about to say changes nothing above though. The fact that you are having sex and he comes from money will make any criminal case very difficult on you. I understand completely why you would not want to go to the police. I still think an anonymous tip off to his family, wife, or employer would be in order though.",

I mean I can legally jizz into my own milk, but in general it's likely not legal where you are to trick someone into consuming your semen. How explicit the law is varies from state to state though.\n\n\n[This guy jizzed in his coworkers coffee](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/04/02/man-pleads-guilty-to-ejaculating-into-co-workers-coffee/).\n\n\nHe was later arrested, but due to the wording of the law they weren't able to charge him with a felony. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor and got 45 days in jail. The day he was sentenced also happened to be the day the Governor signed into law an updated definition of felonious sexual assault that included slipping semen into an unwitting person's food or drink.",
