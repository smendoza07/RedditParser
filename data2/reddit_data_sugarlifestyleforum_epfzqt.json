    "body": "So I am over at my SBs new apartment and it was super hot. But not the good kind of hot, the AC was busted. I suggest that she call maintenance and while she does that I found a washcloth and a cup of ice water to try and do a sexy icy sponge bath. It was NOT sexy but still a nice relief from the sweating.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe start fooling around and there is a knock on the bedroom door. Not at the front door mind you, the actual bedroom door. The maintenance guys are there and let themselves into the apartment. A TOTAL panic sets in. I run over to the door naked and hiding behind it let them know we need a minute. She starts freaking out that she needs her glasses. I\u2019m like \u201cYou don\u2019t need your glasses you need to put clothes on\u201d. She isn't listening. She finds her glasses and then proceeds to start opening the door topless. I slammed the door back closed and reminded her that her tits were out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe puts on a top and still panicked tells me to hide in the closet. So of course I hide in the closet. I mean it REALLY felt like the natural thing to do in the moment. But I didn\u2019t really think it through. Why am I in the closet? The maintenance guys already saw me. What\u2019s the point of me being in the closet? We aren\u2019t even that far apart in age. Why are we in a total panic? And now that I am in the closet I am sort of stuck there. Seems like it would be even more akward to just emerge from a closet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI guess looking back it felt like we got \u201ccaught\u201d doing something wrong?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe maintenance guys needed to work inside her bedroom for a couple of minutes. I stayed in the closet reminiscing about when I was 16 and hid in a girls closet when her parents came home unexpectedly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood news they fixed the AC and left. At which point we realized the bed had been COVERED in sex toys and BDSM gear the whole time...",

You guys didn't do anything wrong. You're consensual adults. Probably they learnt a few things looking at the bdsm toys. In a way that's a good thing.",
