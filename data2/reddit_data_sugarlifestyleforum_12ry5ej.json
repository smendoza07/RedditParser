    "body": "[Previous date 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/12jqg1w/update_to_wheelie_girl_what_is_peen/)\n\nDate 3 was last night. I debated posting this because it\u2019s a little embarrassing,,,but I have too many Reddit followers I don\u2019t want to let down. \n\nTexted Wheelie Girl (WG) to setup another date. I picked a different restaurant from 2nd date\u2019s embarrassing moment,,,this time was Asian fusion. I also texted WG \u201cIf you feel comfortable I can make a hotel reservation nearby for continuation of our date. You can stay the night if easier for you.\u201d \n\nWG says \u201cAlllllrighty. Can you bring Vizzys too?\u201d I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about so I google it,,don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a yes either. \n\nNext day we meet at restaurant,,she looks cute wearing a dress. She also wore the bulky black shoes with yellow stitching that looks orthopedic. Maybe she has foot problems,,,that\u2019s why she wears these and wheelies?\n\nDinner was nice and good food but no perverted outbursts this time. So after dinner we walk back to the hotel and I tell her the Vizzys are on ice. But I didn\u2019t know which flavors she liked so I got raspberry-tangerine and watermelon. She said \u201cwomp womp my favorite is peach-lemonade,, but that\u2019s ok,, thank you for getting them and for dinner.\u201d Then she gives me a long sloppy kiss while waiting for the crosswalk. During the kiss, I think to myself \u201ci don\u2019t know anyone who says womp womp,,,is this millennial lingo or just wheelie girl lingo?\u201d\n\nWe drank Vizzys in the room and had fun. I won\u2019t get into sexual details but we had a great time. After sex we were exhausted and WG was laying on top of me,her head on my round mountain stomach. She says \u201cI heard when the penis is soft you can twist it 360 degrees,,can I try?\u201d Before I can answer she takes the little guy and twists it. It didn\u2019t hurt but didn\u2019t feel comfortable so I tell her that\u2019s enough. She turns her head and gives me this very pouty look so I felt bad and tell her \u201cfine, keep doing it\u201d. \n\nLater when time to sleep WG didn\u2019t bring a toothbrush so I said I will go buy one at the drugstore. She said it\u2019s ok, it\u2019s too late she will just use mine!! I never shared toothbrush before but next time I will bring extra one. Do I throw away the toothbrush or save it? Sooooo 3rd date wasn\u2019t crazy but still weird.",

So she is outdated?\n\nNo, I guess it may be more that they have been \"rediscovered\".\n\nAs /u/Sugarintheorange /u/cottagewitchpet /u/coffeebeanbookgal and /u/AdBot_1443 refer to, they are still popular to a certain extent.  But it certainly isn't as mainstream as it used to be 30 or 40 years ago.  Dr Martens (or DMs) really are a lot more niche than they ever used to be.\n\nBack in the 1970s, 80s and 90s this brand was very much mainstream, from punks to skinheads to goths (and very male).  Not many girls wore this brand at all.\n\nBack in the day it was all about the boots.  Going right up to the 14 eye black or oxblood boots.\n\nDMs have been popular since the 1960s.  Here in the 1960s are [skinheads v hippies](https://imgur.com/a/rH29wVy).  This carried on into the 70s, 80s and 90s.\n\nAlthough [some girls did embrace the look back then as well](https://imgur.com/a/TnmcOvg)\n\nFrom then, of course, it moved on to [punk](https://imgur.com/a/HI2HGjI)\n\nWhen that photo was taken above I was 18 and my then girlfriend looked quite a lot like the blonde girl sitting on the right of the photo.\n\nOf course back then in high school, we weren't allowed to wear boots so, what are now called their \"1461 smooth leather oxford shoes\", were popular among boys in high school.\n\nThe popularity of DMs has really dropped off since the late 1990s/ early 2000s.  They used to be really quite mainstream amongst a lot of working class young men, based on music and cultural links, but that has more or less gone away now.\n\nSince then they have seen something of a resurgance as a bit of a niche fashion brand but nothing like the cultural icon they used to be 30 or 40 years ago.\n\nJust as an aside, there is another brand - Solovair - that essentially make the same product as DM (in fact, they literally did make DMs from the 1950s to the 1980s) but now the two companies have gone their own way and DM manufactures shoes in Thailand but Solovair still manufactures in the UK.  If you google something like \"Solovair v Dr Marten\" you'll see that there is a heated debate online as to which company produces the best boots.",

So she is outdated?\n\nNo, I guess it may be more that they have been \"rediscovered\".\n\nAs /u/Sugarintheorange /u/cottagewitchpet /u/coffeebeanbookgal and /u/AdBot_1443 refer to, they are still popular to a certain extent.  But it certainly isn't as mainstream as it used to be 30 or 40 years ago.  Dr Martens (or DMs) really are a lot more niche than they ever used to be.\n\nBack in the 1970s, 80s and 90s this brand was very much mainstream, from punks to skinheads to goths (and very male).  Not many girls wore this brand at all.\n\nBack in the day it was all about the boots.  Going right up to the 14 eye black or oxblood boots.\n\nDMs have been popular since the 1960s.  Here in the 1960s are [skinheads v hippies](https://imgur.com/a/rH29wVy).  This carried on into the 70s, 80s and 90s.\n\nAlthough [some girls did embrace the look back then as well](https://imgur.com/a/TnmcOvg)\n\nFrom then, of course, it moved on to [punk](https://imgur.com/a/HI2HGjI)\n\nWhen that photo was taken above I was 18 and my then girlfriend looked quite a lot like the blonde girl sitting on the right of the photo.\n\nOf course back then in high school, we weren't allowed to wear boots so, what are now called their \"1461 smooth leather oxford shoes\", were popular among boys in high school.\n\nThe popularity of DMs has really dropped off since the late 1990s/ early 2000s.  They used to be really quite mainstream amongst a lot of working class young men, based on music and cultural links, but that has more or less gone away now.\n\nSince then they have seen something of a resurgance as a bit of a niche fashion brand but nothing like the cultural icon they used to be 30 or 40 years ago.\n\nJust as an aside, there is another brand - Solovair - that essentially make the same product as DM (in fact, they literally did make DMs from the 1950s to the 1980s) but now the two companies have gone their own way and DM manufactures shoes in Thailand but Solovair still manufactures in the UK.  If you google something like \"Solovair v Dr Marten\" you'll see that there is a heated debate online as to which company produces the best boots.",

So she is outdated?\n\nNo, I guess it may be more that they have been \"rediscovered\".\n\nAs /u/Sugarintheorange /u/cottagewitchpet /u/coffeebeanbookgal and /u/AdBot_1443 refer to, they are still popular to a certain extent.  But it certainly isn't as mainstream as it used to be 30 or 40 years ago.  Dr Martens (or DMs) really are a lot more niche than they ever used to be.\n\nBack in the 1970s, 80s and 90s this brand was very much mainstream, from punks to skinheads to goths (and very male).  Not many girls wore this brand at all.\n\nBack in the day it was all about the boots.  Going right up to the 14 eye black or oxblood boots.\n\nDMs have been popular since the 1960s.  Here in the 1960s are [skinheads v hippies](https://imgur.com/a/rH29wVy).  This carried on into the 70s, 80s and 90s.\n\nAlthough [some girls did embrace the look back then as well](https://imgur.com/a/TnmcOvg)\n\nFrom then, of course, it moved on to [punk](https://imgur.com/a/HI2HGjI)\n\nWhen that photo was taken above I was 18 and my then girlfriend looked quite a lot like the blonde girl sitting on the right of the photo.\n\nOf course back then in high school, we weren't allowed to wear boots so, what are now called their \"1461 smooth leather oxford shoes\", were popular among boys in high school.\n\nThe popularity of DMs has really dropped off since the late 1990s/ early 2000s.  They used to be really quite mainstream amongst a lot of working class young men, based on music and cultural links, but that has more or less gone away now.\n\nSince then they have seen something of a resurgance as a bit of a niche fashion brand but nothing like the cultural icon they used to be 30 or 40 years ago.\n\nJust as an aside, there is another brand - Solovair - that essentially make the same product as DM (in fact, they literally did make DMs from the 1950s to the 1980s) but now the two companies have gone their own way and DM manufactures shoes in Thailand but Solovair still manufactures in the UK.  If you google something like \"Solovair v Dr Marten\" you'll see that there is a heated debate online as to which company produces the best boots.",

So she is outdated?\n\nNo, I guess it may be more that they have been \"rediscovered\".\n\nAs /u/Sugarintheorange /u/cottagewitchpet /u/coffeebeanbookgal and /u/AdBot_1443 refer to, they are still popular to a certain extent.  But it certainly isn't as mainstream as it used to be 30 or 40 years ago.  Dr Martens (or DMs) really are a lot more niche than they ever used to be.\n\nBack in the 1970s, 80s and 90s this brand was very much mainstream, from punks to skinheads to goths (and very male).  Not many girls wore this brand at all.\n\nBack in the day it was all about the boots.  Going right up to the 14 eye black or oxblood boots.\n\nDMs have been popular since the 1960s.  Here in the 1960s are [skinheads v hippies](https://imgur.com/a/rH29wVy).  This carried on into the 70s, 80s and 90s.\n\nAlthough [some girls did embrace the look back then as well](https://imgur.com/a/TnmcOvg)\n\nFrom then, of course, it moved on to [punk](https://imgur.com/a/HI2HGjI)\n\nWhen that photo was taken above I was 18 and my then girlfriend looked quite a lot like the blonde girl sitting on the right of the photo.\n\nOf course back then in high school, we weren't allowed to wear boots so, what are now called their \"1461 smooth leather oxford shoes\", were popular among boys in high school.\n\nThe popularity of DMs has really dropped off since the late 1990s/ early 2000s.  They used to be really quite mainstream amongst a lot of working class young men, based on music and cultural links, but that has more or less gone away now.\n\nSince then they have seen something of a resurgance as a bit of a niche fashion brand but nothing like the cultural icon they used to be 30 or 40 years ago.\n\nJust as an aside, there is another brand - Solovair - that essentially make the same product as DM (in fact, they literally did make DMs from the 1950s to the 1980s) but now the two companies have gone their own way and DM manufactures shoes in Thailand but Solovair still manufactures in the UK.  If you google something like \"Solovair v Dr Marten\" you'll see that there is a heated debate online as to which company produces the best boots.",
