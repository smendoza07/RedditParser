What straight men think looks good on a guy is usually whatever makes them look tougher, which is not necessarily the best look if you're trying to meet girls. There's no doubt in my mind that the guy on the left has more chances with a broader demographic of women than the guy on the right. No doubt at all. But here in this sub, everyone just wants whatever makes you look tougher. This guy needed a trim and shaping. The buzz is not better.",

Just remember to lightly exfoliate a few times a week and always use sunscreen on your scalp now that your hair isn't protecting it. Scalp sunburn is not something I would wish on anyone.",
