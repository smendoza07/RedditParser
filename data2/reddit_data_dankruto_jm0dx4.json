Pein bodies have all the powers that rinnegan offers (plus being able to control all elements of chakra) literally embodied so each body has a different power and you can see them. Nagato's original power thanks to Rinnegan, yes, was able to summon the gedo mazo. Byt it was the gedo mazo which in turn crippled Nagato when Yahiko died, with chakra rods that are meant to bind tailed beasts. Nagato repurposed them to be able to control pein bodies instead of bijuu. Yes rinnegan allows him to control gedo mazo and the chakra rods, but it's not really the power of rinnegan but rather the gedo mazo.",

Pein bodies have all the powers that rinnegan offers (plus being able to control all elements of chakra) literally embodied so each body has a different power and you can see them. Nagato's original power thanks to Rinnegan, yes, was able to summon the gedo mazo. Byt it was the gedo mazo which in turn crippled Nagato when Yahiko died, with chakra rods that are meant to bind tailed beasts. Nagato repurposed them to be able to control pein bodies instead of bijuu. Yes rinnegan allows him to control gedo mazo and the chakra rods, but it's not really the power of rinnegan but rather the gedo mazo.",

Pein bodies have all the powers that rinnegan offers (plus being able to control all elements of chakra) literally embodied so each body has a different power and you can see them. Nagato's original power thanks to Rinnegan, yes, was able to summon the gedo mazo. Byt it was the gedo mazo which in turn crippled Nagato when Yahiko died, with chakra rods that are meant to bind tailed beasts. Nagato repurposed them to be able to control pein bodies instead of bijuu. Yes rinnegan allows him to control gedo mazo and the chakra rods, but it's not really the power of rinnegan but rather the gedo mazo.",

Pein bodies have all the powers that rinnegan offers (plus being able to control all elements of chakra) literally embodied so each body has a different power and you can see them. Nagato's original power thanks to Rinnegan, yes, was able to summon the gedo mazo. Byt it was the gedo mazo which in turn crippled Nagato when Yahiko died, with chakra rods that are meant to bind tailed beasts. Nagato repurposed them to be able to control pein bodies instead of bijuu. Yes rinnegan allows him to control gedo mazo and the chakra rods, but it's not really the power of rinnegan but rather the gedo mazo.",

Nagato's original power thanks to Rinnegan, yes, was able to summon the gedo mazo. Byt it was the gedo mazo which in turn crippled Nagato when Yahiko died, with chakra rods that are meant to bind tailed beasts. Nagato repurposed them to be able to control pein bodies instead of bijuu. Yes rinnegan allows him to control gedo mazo and the chakra rods, but it's not really the power of rinnegan but rather the gedo mazo.",
