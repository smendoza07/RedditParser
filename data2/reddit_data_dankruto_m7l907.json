Naruto went like 13 years without anybody but Iruka and the ramen guy being nice to him. Sasuke of all people accepting Naruto as a friend was the biggest stepping stone Naruto could have gotten to help cross the bridge to being a splendid Shinobi.\n\nAfter he turned dark, Naruto felt he owed Sasuke, for Sasuke had helped *him* out of darkness before",

In her own words she \"wanted absorb all his pain if it was possible\" which does suggest that her reasons for loving sasuke were not as selfish as people act like they are\n\nIm not the biggest fan of their canon relationship but i also dont think kishimoto wrote sakura's love towards sasuke as selfish or shallow",

And then let's not forget Konan was the first to actually break Tobi's mask and force him to use Izanagi (and in general just having badass face shots etc). Also don't forget Ino who did a lot in the war, like taking control of Obito just before he would fire a Ten Tails bijuu bomb, and transmitting information so hard blood started running from her nose (to mentally force yourself to nosebleed is way different than just getting punched in the nose and bleeding). Also let's not forget Kushina could stand up for herself and put up a fight in a lot of instances, even restraining Nine Tails.",

In her own words she \"wanted absorb all his pain if it was possible\" which does suggest that her reasons for loving sasuke were not as selfish as people act like they are\n\nIm not the biggest fan of their canon relationship but i also dont think kishimoto wrote sakura's love towards sasuke as selfish or shallow",

She doesn't say or do anything that may imply her feelings, so I am just judging what I see.\n\nAlso, when you say \"she just loves sasuke\" -- that IS the extent of her love, if she doesn't know it, how am I supposed to? haha",

And then let's not forget Konan was the first to actually break Tobi's mask and force him to use Izanagi (and in general just having badass face shots etc). Also don't forget Ino who did a lot in the war, like taking control of Obito just before he would fire a Ten Tails bijuu bomb, and transmitting information so hard blood started running from her nose (to mentally force yourself to nosebleed is way different than just getting punched in the nose and bleeding). Also let's not forget Kushina could stand up for herself and put up a fight in a lot of instances, even restraining Nine Tails.",

In her own words she \"wanted absorb all his pain if it was possible\" which does suggest that her reasons for loving sasuke were not as selfish as people act like they are\n\nIm not the biggest fan of their canon relationship but i also dont think kishimoto wrote sakura's love towards sasuke as selfish or shallow",

She doesn't say or do anything that may imply her feelings, so I am just judging what I see.\n\nAlso, when you say \"she just loves sasuke\" -- that IS the extent of her love, if she doesn't know it, how am I supposed to? haha",

And then let's not forget Konan was the first to actually break Tobi's mask and force him to use Izanagi (and in general just having badass face shots etc). Also don't forget Ino who did a lot in the war, like taking control of Obito just before he would fire a Ten Tails bijuu bomb, and transmitting information so hard blood started running from her nose (to mentally force yourself to nosebleed is way different than just getting punched in the nose and bleeding). Also let's not forget Kushina could stand up for herself and put up a fight in a lot of instances, even restraining Nine Tails.",

Tsunade was fkn BA against madara, getting stabbed by Susanoo, breaking Susanoo and then using it to attack Madara back, and in general just going against the whole female support thing when she went on the offense, as well as specifically saying that \"I may be a woman, but I am not a weak woman\". And then let's not forget Konan was the first to actually break Tobi's mask and force him to use Izanagi (and in general just having badass face shots etc). Also don't forget Ino who did a lot in the war, like taking control of Obito just before he would fire a Ten Tails bijuu bomb, and transmitting information so hard blood started running from her nose (to mentally force yourself to nosebleed is way different than just getting punched in the nose and bleeding). Also let's not forget Kushina could stand up for herself and put up a fight in a lot of instances, even restraining Nine Tails.",

And then let's not forget Konan was the first to actually break Tobi's mask and force him to use Izanagi (and in general just having badass face shots etc). Also don't forget Ino who did a lot in the war, like taking control of Obito just before he would fire a Ten Tails bijuu bomb, and transmitting information so hard blood started running from her nose (to mentally force yourself to nosebleed is way different than just getting punched in the nose and bleeding). Also let's not forget Kushina could stand up for herself and put up a fight in a lot of instances, even restraining Nine Tails.",
