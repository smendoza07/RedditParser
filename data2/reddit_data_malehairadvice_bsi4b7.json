The product I\u2019ve found to work best is [Baxter of California - Clay Pomade](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000MIKEZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8). Works great for all sorts of hair types and has great hold with a matte finish.\n\nAlso you should look into this youtuber called [The Pomp](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig587fYrN-g). He makes great product review videos and in that one he\u2019s using the product I mentioned.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d ask my barber to just trim about an inch or so off the top and blend the long top with the sides. Keep the part where it is in the photo and just slick everything back. You can try blowdrying the front to give a little more volume. Dry shampoo can also be good to add volume. Either way, you\u2019re not far off!",

Trim the bangs a bit if you want and get the sided layered to change it up too.",

Works great for all sorts of hair types and has great hold with a matte finish.\n\nAlso you should look into this youtuber called [The Pomp](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig587fYrN-g). He makes great product review videos and in that one he\u2019s using the product I mentioned.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d ask my barber to just trim about an inch or so off the top and blend the long top with the sides. Keep the part where it is in the photo and just slick everything back. You can try blowdrying the front to give a little more volume. Dry shampoo can also be good to add volume. Either way, you\u2019re not far off!",

Works great for all sorts of hair types and has great hold with a matte finish.\n\nAlso you should look into this youtuber called [The Pomp](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig587fYrN-g). He makes great product review videos and in that one he\u2019s using the product I mentioned.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d ask my barber to just trim about an inch or so off the top and blend the long top with the sides. Keep the part where it is in the photo and just slick everything back. You can try blowdrying the front to give a little more volume. Dry shampoo can also be good to add volume. Either way, you\u2019re not far off!",

It's presumptuous and arrogant and you should specify who you're talking to if that's really the case. If you meant that towards OP, why not refer to him directly instead of reply to me? Smells like you're selling something. I didn't say his situation was bad either, good for you, have thick skin and try to reflect that mentality going forward next time you want to be so condescending. The length isn't the issue, but it's clear he's not going for a \"long hairstyle\" you're just grasping at straws to try and save face.",
