    "body": "Just an off-my-chest-rant kind of thing.\n\nOne of the first ever persons I chatted with on SA when I started on this little world just started Medical school last week.\n\nShe had been trying to get in for two years. In her country, how it works is: you need to compete against 1,000+ people for like 20 places. If you make it, then tuition is almost free. If you don't, well, tough luck. First-year she tried (after like 3 months we met), and she placed top 27.... so 7 too low.\n\nThis year she placed #10, and she finally made it. \n\nShe worked SO hard for this, and I'm so proud of her. With her work+study schedule we won't be able to see each other that much, but that's ok! We'll still see each other every now and then. To start, we're spending 3 days at an exotic beach location in the coming month to celebrate.\n\nThat's really it. I can't share my excitement with any of my friends, so thought I'd share here.",

I passed.  the previous pre-med one was about 6 years ago, \"wasn't comfortable yet for intimacy\" but posted lots of instagram pics with the next guy in hawaii, so i am assuming she got over that mental barrier, but she finished college and abandoned pre-med work. I thought it would be great to mentor, I would actually really like that and it was something i sought to provide but few takers it seems. congratulations!",

            "body": "this is true, but also true that it is much easier to say you are pre-med (and make your mother very proud and with something to brag about - for a while) than to actually follow through and do it. most don't have the interest level in it to follow through and pursue. It is very hard to study difficult things that you aren't interested in.  If you like partying and going out, you probably are not going to like spending a fair number of friday and saturday nights studying.  I never blame people for quitting. It is a brutal process especially if you don't have an inherent interest in the science, and many people don't , even the ones in my class didnt like an enormous amount of the material. And you have to learn it really well, there are series of board exams",
