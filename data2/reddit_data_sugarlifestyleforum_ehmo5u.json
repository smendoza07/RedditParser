    "body": "SB here. So I was on SA and started chatting to this nice, attractive guy. He said he found me very interesting and a conversation began that lasted for a couple of months. This included several phone calls and skype chats. All along the messages were flirtatious, (\u2018you\u2019re very attractive, I can\u2019t wait to meet you\u2019 that sort of thing from him). I really liked him and we set a date to meet. It meant me travelling up to London on the 26th of December, but I thought he was great, he thought I was great, he promised a generous and regular allowance in his profile so I thought it might be worth it.\n\nWe were meeting late so I booked a hostel to stay in. Now normally I don\u2019t travel far for M&Gs, and I certainly don\u2019t do anything expensive like book a place to stay, but this guy seemed so nice and genuine that I decided to take the chance. Having been in the sugar bowl for a while I thought I was wise enough to know when I was being taken for a ride (ha!) \n\nSo, time passes, I spend a month slimming down to get rid of those pesky extra kilos, bought myself a nice dress.\n\nFour days before the meeting he tells me he has a wonderful surprise for me, and that in preparation I must watch the film \u2018Rebecca\u2019 (plot summary: rich man marries young ingenuous woman and whisks her off to country mansion where she is terrorised by an evil housekeeper.) I found this a bit weird, but hoped it could be a good omen. \n\nSo the date is coming up and he\u2019s being all mysterious about the life-changing news he has for me, and how impatient he is to see me. The day comes, I put on my make-up, and make the long, tiresome journey to London.\n\nI\u2019m waiting for him in the lobby of his posh Mayfair hotel. He sweeps in - as attractive in flesh as in photos! - and buys me a drink in the hotel bar. \n\nI\u2019m on tenterhooks, waiting to hear what could possibly be the wonderful news he has for me... \n\nAnd it turns out he wants to employ me. As his housekeeper. He had me watch the film not so I could imagine myself as the romantic heroine being swept off her feet, but see myself in the shoes of the crusty old bag who makes sure the meals are acceptable and that the maids don\u2019t steal the silver. He needed a woman to organise his 10 homes around the world, hire and fire staff, make sure he isn\u2019t working too hard, and to put his many lovers in their place when they begin to get a bit too uppity.\n\nHe added, \u201cof course there would be nothing romantic/sexual between you and me. That would get in the way of business. Plus, you\u2019re not really my type.\u201d\n\nTo say that I was deflated was an understatement. \n\nI sat there in my nice dress and my careful make-up and watched his mouth go up and down for a while, and then I made my excuses and left. \n\nThe job offer was not bad - a generous wage, but involved a 7 day week and a lot of responsibility, not to mention having to be ready to drop everything and pack my suitcase as soon as he decided to move from his Swiss home to his house in Gibraltar. Not something I think I would be cut out for even if were 100% physically well.\n\nMy main niggles about the whole experience \n\n- I told the guy right from the word go that I\u2019m suffering from a chronic illness and can\u2019t really work. If he\u2019d just come out about wanting to employ me I could have told him no and saved myself a difficult, painful and expensive journey. \n\n- In all of our conversations he used romantic, flirty language. Then he waits til we meet to say he doesn\u2019t fancy me? \n\n- Why the hell was he on a sugar dating site when he was looking for an employee? Surely there are websites for that?!? \n\n- oh, and as a seasoned sugar baby, I\u2019m kicking myself for being so dumb and naive. \n\nAnyway, I trailed back to my hostel to spend a wakeful night listening to the snores of the guy in the bed above me and crying into my pillow. \n\nI\u2019m just posting this here partly for cathartic reasons, and partly to ask - is this kind of behaviour... normal? Has it happened to anyone else? \n\nTL;DR - I got my hopes up about a nice attractive SD and made a difficult journey to meet him and he offers me a job as a \u2018Nanny but to a 60 year old man instead of a child\u2019 (his words, not mine.) I feel upset and wonder if this is a common occurrence or if this guy is just nuts.",

(I like quick meetings, as to not waste time and time effort.) \n\nDuring the course of the conversation, we talked about his software business and my job. He realized I worked in a company that could benefit from his software; particularly my role was useful in getting his foot in the door. \n\nAt the end of the lunch, he asked how I felt. I said I thought we had a great connection so far and would be interested in another meeting. He said he\u2019d rather explore the business side of things (using my connections to swell his software into the company). Also, he wanted to know if I\u2019d be interested in personally testing his software, since I\u2019d been in the ideal role to use this software in a past job. Compensated, of course. Eye roll. And by the way, since he was interested in the business side and doesn\u2019t want to be sued for conflict of interest, etc., why don\u2019t we see how the business side turns out then, we can explore the romantic side of things. \n\nThat\u2019s going to be a pass and block from me. You\u2019re not going to use my name or my job to sell your software into my company and make money for yourself. Fuck off. I\u2019m no longer interested.",

I wouldn't do it indefinitely, even if 100% healthy, 7 days a week and travel is rough but if you're in charge you can lessen it somewhat through delegation, and when you've had enough just leave with a new list of resume experience and a good bit of pocket change",

I go to the job to sell my ass and the guy tells me he doesn\u2019t want my ass, he wants a maid. \n\nIt\u2019s like someone ordering 10 kilos of cheese from a dairy 2 months in advance. I\u2019m the cheesemaker. They spend 2 months telling me how much they\u2019re looking forward to sampling my cheddar. I go to deliver the cheese and when I get there they tell me they actually want tofu. Now I\u2019m an angry cheesemaker, I conserved my stock of cheeses and made the journey to deliver them for nothing. \n\nI have every right to be pissed off about bring misled. You being bitter over the fact that you can\u2019t get free poon has nothing to do with my predicament",
