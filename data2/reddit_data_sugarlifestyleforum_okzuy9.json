Now, improvements (although nothing is likely needed) would be a better view of the dazzling smile you show with your pug and a photo of you dressed up for a date.\n\nAbout me: As I said concise. Adding an interest that a date can be build around would be a nice addition - find dining, a cuisine you love, a style of art you enjoy exploring, winetasting, or any of these items you love or would like learning more about.\n\nSeeking: No really actionable suggestions here.",

I get more messages asking me to be a dom or submissive \u201cblack queen\u201d or \u201cchocolate goddess\u201d when i know these men are not making the color of women of other ethnicities\u2019 skin the main focus. We AA women are stuck in between being undesired or fetishized for the most part which are both quite discouraging especially taking in the fact that yes, these men do lowball us\u2026It is relatively hard to find someone, even in regular dating, that respects us for who we are as people.

I get more messages asking me to be a dom or submissive \u201cblack queen\u201d or \u201cchocolate goddess\u201d when i know these men are not making the color of women of other ethnicities\u2019 skin the main focus. We AA women are stuck in between being undesired or fetishized for the most part which are both quite discouraging especially taking in the fact that yes, these men do lowball us\u2026It is relatively hard to find someone, even in regular dating, that respects us for who we are as people.

The pool for men that want black women compared to others is not that large and many of those that do offer lower amounts than they would for nonblack SBs or are disrespectful towards us. These things make it difficult to find someone that we\u2019d want a SR with and a SR involved comfort for both parties. So overall it\u2019s still hard and if you think we should settle just bc someone has interest in us for once then yikes. The OP is beautiful like I said before but you should realize that that\u2019s not the only problem within this topic. I hope you can understand that it is not just a face value issue.",
