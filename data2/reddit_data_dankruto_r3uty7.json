Naruto and Sasuke had to use Hagaromo's seal *and* had the biggest plot weirdness with DMS kakashi just to take down Kaguya. \n\nNow in Boruto, they had an issue after the movie to basically either go slice of life (like in the start of the show), have an incredibly convoluted reason why the 2 reincarnations cant do everything OR just write them off. They chose to write them off using Isshiki.\n\nIsshiki was basically entirely a counter to Naruto and Sasuke's arsenals. You can't do much against a dude who's *that* much stronger than you and with the ability to just shrink all Ninjutsu. \n\nThe two also don't have main character plot armor, they weren't getting new abilities but instead was shown to hone on old abilities. They still got fucked, twice, and Baryon Mode was pulled out to eliminate his absolute stregnth from the story.\n\nAs for Sasuke, he got treated like a surfboard by Isshiki after he teleported like 3? people into Isshiki's realm. When his eye was stabbed out he literally can barely walk, I don't know how he could've just pulled out the chakra intensive Rinnegan abilities (against a foe with NO chakra to be sensed who only showed up AFTER isshiki was defeated) when he was stabbed.\n\nPlus isn't Borushiki like 80% Otsusuki(That being Momoshiki)? Wouldn't Momoshiki's power make his speed above Kaguya's?\n\n\n\n\nOh and Final Valley Sasuke got like a chakra refill via Hagaromo, he fought for like a day with a MS, *tried* to fight against Kaguya and got sent to a desert for half the fight while Naruto was fighting for his life, and showed up against Naruto and sealed the Bijuu and later used them as another chakra refill.",

A lot more than it does in the west, cutting your hair in Japan is heavily symbolic of rebirth in many forms of media and in everyday life. Now getting a trim isn\u2019t what I\u2019m talking about here. \n\nSakura completely cuts off her long hair in which she took pride in, as to show that she was focusing on the wrong things. And through this process of rebirth she focused on what mattered. Getting stronger and becoming a better shinobi. Her character completely pivots after this moment from the titular \u201cGirl ninja\u201d to more strictly \u201cstruggling to find her strength\u201d. Which her character eventually finds with Tsunade \n\nEven though she got her ass whooped many times even after this. She still had raw power and skill beyond what most ninja could ever achieve\u2026 *by 17*. And while she isn\u2019t a perfect character nor does she win every fight\u2026 but this scene and the scene after showed that she had something that both connected her to her teammates and separated her from other shinobi \n\nThe ability to get back up no matter the odds.",

You can't do much against a dude who's *that* much stronger than you and with the ability to just shrink all Ninjutsu. \n\nThe two also don't have main character plot armor, they weren't getting new abilities but instead was shown to hone on old abilities. They still got fucked, twice, and Baryon Mode was pulled out to eliminate his absolute stregnth from the story.\n\nAs for Sasuke, he got treated like a surfboard by Isshiki after he teleported like 3? people into Isshiki's realm. When his eye was stabbed out he literally can barely walk, I don't know how he could've just pulled out the chakra intensive Rinnegan abilities (against a foe with NO chakra to be sensed who only showed up AFTER isshiki was defeated) when he was stabbed.\n\nPlus isn't Borushiki like 80% Otsusuki(That being Momoshiki)? Wouldn't Momoshiki's power make his speed above Kaguya's?\n\n\n\n\nOh and Final Valley Sasuke got like a chakra refill via Hagaromo, he fought for like a day with a MS, *tried* to fight against Kaguya and got sent to a desert for half the fight while Naruto was fighting for his life, and showed up against Naruto and sealed the Bijuu and later used them as another chakra refill.",

Naruto and Sasuke had to use Hagaromo's seal *and* had the biggest plot weirdness with DMS kakashi just to take down Kaguya. \n\nNow in Boruto, they had an issue after the movie to basically either go slice of life (like in the start of the show), have an incredibly convoluted reason why the 2 reincarnations cant do everything OR just write them off. They chose to write them off using Isshiki.\n\nIsshiki was basically entirely a counter to Naruto and Sasuke's arsenals. You can't do much against a dude who's *that* much stronger than you and with the ability to just shrink all Ninjutsu. \n\nThe two also don't have main character plot armor, they weren't getting new abilities but instead was shown to hone on old abilities. They still got fucked, twice, and Baryon Mode was pulled out to eliminate his absolute stregnth from the story.\n\nAs for Sasuke, he got treated like a surfboard by Isshiki after he teleported like 3? people into Isshiki's realm. When his eye was stabbed out he literally can barely walk, I don't know how he could've just pulled out the chakra intensive Rinnegan abilities (against a foe with NO chakra to be sensed who only showed up AFTER isshiki was defeated) when he was stabbed.\n\nPlus isn't Borushiki like 80% Otsusuki(That being Momoshiki)? Wouldn't Momoshiki's power make his speed above Kaguya's?\n\n\n\n\nOh and Final Valley Sasuke got like a chakra refill via Hagaromo, he fought for like a day with a MS, *tried* to fight against Kaguya and got sent to a desert for half the fight while Naruto was fighting for his life, and showed up against Naruto and sealed the Bijuu and later used them as another chakra refill.",

Naruto and Sasuke had to use Hagaromo's seal *and* had the biggest plot weirdness with DMS kakashi just to take down Kaguya. \n\nNow in Boruto, they had an issue after the movie to basically either go slice of life (like in the start of the show), have an incredibly convoluted reason why the 2 reincarnations cant do everything OR just write them off. They chose to write them off using Isshiki.\n\nIsshiki was basically entirely a counter to Naruto and Sasuke's arsenals. You can't do much against a dude who's *that* much stronger than you and with the ability to just shrink all Ninjutsu. \n\nThe two also don't have main character plot armor, they weren't getting new abilities but instead was shown to hone on old abilities. They still got fucked, twice, and Baryon Mode was pulled out to eliminate his absolute stregnth from the story.\n\nAs for Sasuke, he got treated like a surfboard by Isshiki after he teleported like 3? people into Isshiki's realm. When his eye was stabbed out he literally can barely walk, I don't know how he could've just pulled out the chakra intensive Rinnegan abilities (against a foe with NO chakra to be sensed who only showed up AFTER isshiki was defeated) when he was stabbed.\n\nPlus isn't Borushiki like 80% Otsusuki(That being Momoshiki)? Wouldn't Momoshiki's power make his speed above Kaguya's?\n\n\n\n\nOh and Final Valley Sasuke got like a chakra refill via Hagaromo, he fought for like a day with a MS, *tried* to fight against Kaguya and got sent to a desert for half the fight while Naruto was fighting for his life, and showed up against Naruto and sealed the Bijuu and later used them as another chakra refill.",

Naruto and Sasuke had to use Hagaromo's seal *and* had the biggest plot weirdness with DMS kakashi just to take down Kaguya. \n\nNow in Boruto, they had an issue after the movie to basically either go slice of life (like in the start of the show), have an incredibly convoluted reason why the 2 reincarnations cant do everything OR just write them off. They chose to write them off using Isshiki.\n\nIsshiki was basically entirely a counter to Naruto and Sasuke's arsenals. You can't do much against a dude who's *that* much stronger than you and with the ability to just shrink all Ninjutsu. \n\nThe two also don't have main character plot armor, they weren't getting new abilities but instead was shown to hone on old abilities. They still got fucked, twice, and Baryon Mode was pulled out to eliminate his absolute stregnth from the story.\n\nAs for Sasuke, he got treated like a surfboard by Isshiki after he teleported like 3? people into Isshiki's realm. When his eye was stabbed out he literally can barely walk, I don't know how he could've just pulled out the chakra intensive Rinnegan abilities (against a foe with NO chakra to be sensed who only showed up AFTER isshiki was defeated) when he was stabbed.\n\nPlus isn't Borushiki like 80% Otsusuki(That being Momoshiki)? Wouldn't Momoshiki's power make his speed above Kaguya's?\n\n\n\n\nOh and Final Valley Sasuke got like a chakra refill via Hagaromo, he fought for like a day with a MS, *tried* to fight against Kaguya and got sent to a desert for half the fight while Naruto was fighting for his life, and showed up against Naruto and sealed the Bijuu and later used them as another chakra refill.",
