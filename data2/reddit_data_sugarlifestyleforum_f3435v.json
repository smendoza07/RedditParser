No gifts, no sweet texts, nothing. \n\nMaybe I just picked a meh fuck boy but damn I feel so alive after I leave my SD and I just feel not horny now. \n\nVanilla hookups suck. \n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

I love being close to people, but that freaks guys out (I\u2019ve had plenty of hookups where I don\u2019t even get cuddled after:( )but in the sugar world it\u2019s so different. I\u2019ve never even felt comfortable enough to fall asleep after sex with vanilla hookups, but I slept like a baby the first time with my SD. It was amazing",
