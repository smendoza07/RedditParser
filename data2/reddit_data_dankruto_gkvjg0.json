He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

Tobirama was for sure pessimistic about the Uchiha, from the decades of on sight slaughter between the two clans. He didn\u2019t outrightly show it, but his opinions on the overall clan tells you just as much. The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully. It\u2019s just a shame that the culmination of everything lead to the Uchiha\u2019s perceived solution of a Coup.",

There is not an example of misfiring in his time. He gave them power. What more did those entitled snowflakes want?! They were the most influential clan in the village right up there with the Senju.\n\nThere is zero implication that police are not liked by Konoha citizens. Theirs is a traditional society and they live and respect their leaders and protectors. Girls loved Sasuke at school (while they avoided or bullied Naruto), Itachi and Shisui were decorated Shinobi, Obito was going to become Hokage! The root of the problem was Madara the Mad Rage Whore. He ruined Obito's life, caused the attacks on Konoha and ignited Uchiha distrust. And Danzo took advantage.\n\nTobirama was too nice to them.\n\nLet's make a list of people responsible for the Uchiha massacre in order:\n\n1. Madara\n\n2. Danzo\n\n3. Koharu\n\n4. Homura\n\n5&6&7.

I wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s not directly to blame, but I think we can both agree that the only fault Tobirama had in it, is that he implemented the system that allowed for people like Danzo and Tobi to take advantage of it. Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs. I mean, when the massacre happened, every other clan just shrugged and said oh well, what a travesty. It might have been because in the Itachi Shinden, it was stated that outsiders were not allowed in the compound, and that the Uchiha enforced a strict curfew.",

I hope someone can find it.\n\nEdit: ah wait [here it is](https://www.narutoforums.org/threads/2015-kishimoto-interview-originally-in-french-untranslated-afaik.1136422/) \n\n\u201cTo be frank, the reality is more complex. I feel closer to Sasuke as I would never be able to forget or forgive the one who murders my family. I can see myself in the way Sasuke reacts but reacting like him lead to an overwhelming amount of hatred and violence and to war. History repeats itself and the circle must be broken.\n\nThis manga talks a lot about not repeating the errors of the past. And to be completely honest, overcoming traumatic experiences like Naruto does seems a bit idealist and naive to me. Even though, this kind of utopic idealism has to be written and defended in Shounen mangas. Shounen mangas must carry hope,above all.\u201d",

Any other revenge thing he did was bullshit.\n\nBut as bad as Sasuke is, his doppelganger Madara is even worse. Still hoping Kishi or someone writes a spin-off about Founders Era and we see more of Senju and Uzumaki, less Uchiha glorifying, and more of their evil in the background.\nBecause the flashbacks to those era were pathetic excuses to try and fail to justify Madara. He was still an unsympathetic evil cunt with zero self-awareness. And he got a peaceful death. Ew.",

How much does he have to compromise to protect his village from harm? Actually realises that being Hokage isn't as glamorous or awesome as it seems to be?\n\nBut no...

Not Hashirama. Tobirama wasn't being a pessimist. He was being practical and all he did was right.\n\nAlso a reminder Tobirama came to be Hokage in the middle of first Shinobi war. He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

Tobirama was for sure pessimistic about the Uchiha, from the decades of on sight slaughter between the two clans. He didn\u2019t outrightly show it, but his opinions on the overall clan tells you just as much. The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully. It\u2019s just a shame that the culmination of everything lead to the Uchiha\u2019s perceived solution of a Coup.",

Theirs is a traditional society and they live and respect their leaders and protectors. Girls loved Sasuke at school (while they avoided or bullied Naruto), Itachi and Shisui were decorated Shinobi, Obito was going to become Hokage! The root of the problem was Madara the Mad Rage Whore. He ruined Obito's life, caused the attacks on Konoha and ignited Uchiha distrust. And Danzo took advantage.\n\nTobirama was too nice to them.\n\nLet's make a list of people responsible for the Uchiha massacre in order:\n\n1. Madara\n\n2. Danzo\n\n3. Koharu\n\n4. Homura\n\n5&6&7.

I wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s not directly to blame, but I think we can both agree that the only fault Tobirama had in it, is that he implemented the system that allowed for people like Danzo and Tobi to take advantage of it. Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs. I mean, when the massacre happened, every other clan just shrugged and said oh well, what a travesty. It might have been because in the Itachi Shinden, it was stated that outsiders were not allowed in the compound, and that the Uchiha enforced a strict curfew.",

I hope someone can find it.\n\nEdit: ah wait [here it is](https://www.narutoforums.org/threads/2015-kishimoto-interview-originally-in-french-untranslated-afaik.1136422/) \n\n\u201cTo be frank, the reality is more complex. I feel closer to Sasuke as I would never be able to forget or forgive the one who murders my family. I can see myself in the way Sasuke reacts but reacting like him lead to an overwhelming amount of hatred and violence and to war. History repeats itself and the circle must be broken.\n\nThis manga talks a lot about not repeating the errors of the past. And to be completely honest, overcoming traumatic experiences like Naruto does seems a bit idealist and naive to me. Even though, this kind of utopic idealism has to be written and defended in Shounen mangas. Shounen mangas must carry hope,above all.\u201d",

Any other revenge thing he did was bullshit.\n\nBut as bad as Sasuke is, his doppelganger Madara is even worse. Still hoping Kishi or someone writes a spin-off about Founders Era and we see more of Senju and Uzumaki, less Uchiha glorifying, and more of their evil in the background.\nBecause the flashbacks to those era were pathetic excuses to try and fail to justify Madara. He was still an unsympathetic evil cunt with zero self-awareness. And he got a peaceful death. Ew.",

Not Hashirama. Tobirama wasn't being a pessimist. He was being practical and all he did was right.\n\nAlso a reminder Tobirama came to be Hokage in the middle of first Shinobi war. He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

Tobirama was for sure pessimistic about the Uchiha, from the decades of on sight slaughter between the two clans. He didn\u2019t outrightly show it, but his opinions on the overall clan tells you just as much. The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully. It\u2019s just a shame that the culmination of everything lead to the Uchiha\u2019s perceived solution of a Coup.",

Theirs is a traditional society and they live and respect their leaders and protectors. Girls loved Sasuke at school (while they avoided or bullied Naruto), Itachi and Shisui were decorated Shinobi, Obito was going to become Hokage! The root of the problem was Madara the Mad Rage Whore. He ruined Obito's life, caused the attacks on Konoha and ignited Uchiha distrust. And Danzo took advantage.\n\nTobirama was too nice to them.\n\nLet's make a list of people responsible for the Uchiha massacre in order:\n\n1. Madara\n\n2. Danzo\n\n3. Koharu\n\n4. Homura\n\n5&6&7.

I wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s not directly to blame, but I think we can both agree that the only fault Tobirama had in it, is that he implemented the system that allowed for people like Danzo and Tobi to take advantage of it. Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs. I mean, when the massacre happened, every other clan just shrugged and said oh well, what a travesty. It might have been because in the Itachi Shinden, it was stated that outsiders were not allowed in the compound, and that the Uchiha enforced a strict curfew.",

I hope someone can find it.\n\nEdit: ah wait [here it is](https://www.narutoforums.org/threads/2015-kishimoto-interview-originally-in-french-untranslated-afaik.1136422/) \n\n\u201cTo be frank, the reality is more complex. I feel closer to Sasuke as I would never be able to forget or forgive the one who murders my family. I can see myself in the way Sasuke reacts but reacting like him lead to an overwhelming amount of hatred and violence and to war. History repeats itself and the circle must be broken.\n\nThis manga talks a lot about not repeating the errors of the past. And to be completely honest, overcoming traumatic experiences like Naruto does seems a bit idealist and naive to me. Even though, this kind of utopic idealism has to be written and defended in Shounen mangas. Shounen mangas must carry hope,above all.\u201d",

Any other revenge thing he did was bullshit.\n\nBut as bad as Sasuke is, his doppelganger Madara is even worse. Still hoping Kishi or someone writes a spin-off about Founders Era and we see more of Senju and Uzumaki, less Uchiha glorifying, and more of their evil in the background.\nBecause the flashbacks to those era were pathetic excuses to try and fail to justify Madara. He was still an unsympathetic evil cunt with zero self-awareness. And he got a peaceful death. Ew.",

Not Hashirama. Tobirama wasn't being a pessimist. He was being practical and all he did was right.\n\nAlso a reminder Tobirama came to be Hokage in the middle of first Shinobi war. He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

Tobirama was for sure pessimistic about the Uchiha, from the decades of on sight slaughter between the two clans. He didn\u2019t outrightly show it, but his opinions on the overall clan tells you just as much. The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully. It\u2019s just a shame that the culmination of everything lead to the Uchiha\u2019s perceived solution of a Coup.",

Theirs is a traditional society and they live and respect their leaders and protectors. Girls loved Sasuke at school (while they avoided or bullied Naruto), Itachi and Shisui were decorated Shinobi, Obito was going to become Hokage! The root of the problem was Madara the Mad Rage Whore. He ruined Obito's life, caused the attacks on Konoha and ignited Uchiha distrust. And Danzo took advantage.\n\nTobirama was too nice to them.\n\nLet's make a list of people responsible for the Uchiha massacre in order:\n\n1. Madara\n\n2. Danzo\n\n3. Koharu\n\n4. Homura\n\n5&6&7.

I wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s not directly to blame, but I think we can both agree that the only fault Tobirama had in it, is that he implemented the system that allowed for people like Danzo and Tobi to take advantage of it. Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs. I mean, when the massacre happened, every other clan just shrugged and said oh well, what a travesty. It might have been because in the Itachi Shinden, it was stated that outsiders were not allowed in the compound, and that the Uchiha enforced a strict curfew.",

Any other revenge thing he did was bullshit.\n\nBut as bad as Sasuke is, his doppelganger Madara is even worse. Still hoping Kishi or someone writes a spin-off about Founders Era and we see more of Senju and Uzumaki, less Uchiha glorifying, and more of their evil in the background.\nBecause the flashbacks to those era were pathetic excuses to try and fail to justify Madara. He was still an unsympathetic evil cunt with zero self-awareness. And he got a peaceful death. Ew.",

The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though.

Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs.

He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

Tobirama was for sure pessimistic about the Uchiha, from the decades of on sight slaughter between the two clans.

The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully.

I wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s not directly to blame, but I think we can both agree that the only fault Tobirama had in it, is that he implemented the system that allowed for people like Danzo and Tobi to take advantage of it. Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs.

It might have been because in the Itachi Shinden, it was stated that outsiders were not allowed in the compound, and that the Uchiha enforced a strict curfew.",

He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs.

He gave Uchiha the means to channel their emotions into something productive. Does anyone blame him for being cautions and reasonable? And by anyone, I mean sane people not stupid Uchiha fanatics.\n\nIn the end, Tobirama was maybe too generous with Uchiha. He gave exclusive power to Uchiha while other clans had no such privileges. At best they took care of pets or flowers. No such major administrative power as Uchiha did. The fact Uchiha elders retorted to coup, the overthrowing of government, with the slightest sign of suspicion shows how overly entitled they were.\n\nTobirama's system was working fine for decades until Madara and Danzo and Uchiha elders ruined it.",

He didn\u2019t outrightly show it, but his opinions on the overall clan tells you just as much. The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully. It\u2019s just a shame that the culmination of everything lead to the Uchiha\u2019s perceived solution of a Coup.",

Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs.

Tobirama was for sure pessimistic about the Uchiha, from the decades of on sight slaughter between the two clans. He didn\u2019t outrightly show it, but his opinions on the overall clan tells you just as much. The fact that he wanted to prevent another Madara from rising up, is him implicitly saying that he low key worried about them. \n\nYou have to remember the politics that came from being a police force though. Although they had executive power to uphold order, the majority of the population are typically not fans of the police. \n\nI\u2019m not saying its Tobirama\u2019s or Hiruzen\u2019s or Danzo\u2019s fault. It was a culmination of bad decisions on top of bad decisions from Tobirama\u2019s implicit biases, Hiruzen\u2019s passiveness, Danzo\u2019s oppressiveness, and the Uchiha\u2019s willingness to just take it, without hashing things out with the administration in a civil way. It sure as hell did not help that Tobi was puppeteering from the sidelines, but there were so many opportunities from every party to resolve things peacefully. It\u2019s just a shame that the culmination of everything lead to the Uchiha\u2019s perceived solution of a Coup.",

I wholeheartedly agree that he\u2019s not directly to blame, but I think we can both agree that the only fault Tobirama had in it, is that he implemented the system that allowed for people like Danzo and Tobi to take advantage of it. Of course he had no reason or knowledge of it ever being taken advantage of, if it wasn\u2019t put in place, maybe things would\u2019ve been different. By giving a single clan a lot of authoritative autonomy, other clans must\u2019ve felt as if the Uchiha were favored among the oligarchs. I mean, when the massacre happened, every other clan just shrugged and said oh well, what a travesty. It might have been because in the Itachi Shinden, it was stated that outsiders were not allowed in the compound, and that the Uchiha enforced a strict curfew.",
