There was the Bells Name Tag Elimination arc, then 1vMany arc, then Find the Guest arc, Avoid the Guest arc, then the frequent Spy Games start to happen. Eventually they slowed down a bit they put more emphasis on-the-road missions and themed missions which we have in recent episodes. It became stale eventually when they started to follow a formula that hardly changed while pandering to the guests to win.\n\nUnderstandably, some things HAD to change since the cast suffered injuries for our entertainment and some of them have left their prime over the course of the series. (Most of them started in their late 20s and mid 30s when the show started.) I recall HaHa appeared on an interview detailing how some members especially KJK undergone several surgeries over the years yet still found the time and energy to perform. And slipped discs where scarily the norm injury suffered by the cast members.\n\nI think the inclusion of YSC and JSM really helped picked things up again and the PDs start to understand what works and what doesn't since then.\n\nStill, you have to admit the older episodes like roughly the first 100 episodes where among the most exciting episodes in the series. Nowadays it has centered comedy and their chemistry to further carry the show.",

(Obviously, it IS that hard.) In short, I love watching RM except for KJK.\n\nBut then there was this episode where he said he's tired of playing the show's bad guy. Like, man, he is just doing his job. Does anyone really like to be the villain in a story? From then on, I finally understand his role in RM, and I salute him for absolutely doing his part. RM won't be complete without The Tiger.\n\n(Also, I love his song Loveable! :))",

These were the episodes that gave RM its unique flavour. \n\nThey used to play so many different kinds of games though it always had the nametag elimination. I miss seeing them race in a cab or complete a mission which involved eating ice cream followed by coffee so they could catch a train . I guess what I miss most about the old RM is them being outdoors and doing all sorts of things. Or perhaps I miss the movement. Even nametag elimination had them moving around buildings, climbing stairs or running through shopping malls. RM is now more studio-centric as they are older and with the Covid restrictions in place, the most we see is them moving from A to B in a bus. Still, I wish the PD and writers would experiment more once the restrictions are taken off.",
