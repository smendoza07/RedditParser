I did however have testicular ache 3 times in the first month of using fin which lasted about an hour each time. \n\n* All blood tests etc normal \n\n* Didn\u2019t see any changes for about 12-18 months \n\n* Crown filled right in, hair on top became thicker so my receding hairline looks much better these days. \n\n* I pay $20 ( Australian dollars ) for a 28 pack and take 1 pill each morning \n\n* I believe the vast majority of side effect horror stories you read online are made up resulting in the unnecessary loss of many men\u2019s hair prematurely \n\nHere are my before and after over aug 2019 until now.",

Dermatologists and hair loss specialists often will attest that out of all their patients, they've never seen \"permanent\" side effects.\n\nPersonally when I started fin just over a month ago, I got bloodwork done beforehand.  Then I started at .25mg per day.  I've noticed zero sides so far and plan to increase to .5mg starting in October, then 1mg in December.\n\nIMO even though finasteride is a fairly safe drug, one should always get bloods tested and take precautions when messing with their hormones.",

Listening to their reports of side effects and then instinctively blaming the drug without evidence violates #2.\n\n\nYour example of Covid-19 vaccine is not the best example, as it has become a highly politicized and demonized treatment in the lay public discourse. People are primed to interpret every little problem they come across as a Covid-19 vaccine side effect, because many unscientific voices are telling them to do so and inducing large-scale fear responses. This muddies the water when it comes to \"believing\" someone's report of a side effect. Still, medical professionals should listen to patients who claim side effects and investigate those that are plausible. It would likely not change the risk/benefit ratio with the Covid-19 vaccination, however.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of finasteride is not something I am personally familiar with. It sounds like, for whatever reason, you are questioning medical professional's ability to evaluate this ratio for their patients. That said, if a patient really wants the treatment, they can get it, as OP obviously did.",

Just hoping that it will continue to thicken. PS 1mg a day is quite a lot imo. Whilst fina has a half life of 8 or so hours in serum, its 30 days in your skin tissue.

I started to take whole 1mg tab per day , with in 1-2 months I started to get horrible results , very bad Erectile D. I threw away all pills and mino. I keep loosing hair but at slow rate I started to take alertnative methods such as saw palmetto capsules etc, I bought hairmax in 2010 , it helped upto a certain extent but not completely. now I heard they having topical finestride, I am 42 now. I am not completely bald but 2 patches ,one on crown and another on front , I am taking topical finestride with minoxidil once a day , no side effect, zero. I do not know if I should go for 2 times a day or not . once seems not big results though but no sides either . I am using SALT COMPOSITIONMinoxidil (5% w/v) + Azelaic Acid (1.5% w/v) + Tretinoin (0.01% w/v) in the morning and Minoxidil (5% w/v) + Finasteride (0.1% w/v) in the morning. plus also taking biotin 5000 mcg per day and washing with pharama grade caffeine shampoo . and yes harimax 2-3 times in a week.  I also observed rosemary oil works too.",

My problem has always been the crown, but the scalp in general was bad enough that I was shaving. Also because my hairline hasn\u2019t changed in shape nor thickness since I was a child, it looked weird 3 days after shaving. Thin scalp with a dark, thicker frontal line.\nAnyway, in those three months I went from shaved to full head of hair. Some colleagues asked if I was wearing a wig, even though they saw my hair growing in time.\nThen I started finasteride and had a big shed two months in and lost ground. Since then I haven\u2019t made progress because I get another shed before the situation can improve at all. My last brutal shed started 3 months ago and stopped like 3 weeks ago. I mean I went from tons of hair in my hands when I wash it (every day) to barely any. But I think I\u2019m starting another already. Like every 3 months.\nI think, as diffuse thinners, we\u2019re bound to shed for a very long time because most of our hair needs to be replaced, as most is affected by DHT. Compared to someone who only has a receding hairline, but no problem elsewhere.\nAll I can do is to wait for all of my DHT affected scalp hair to be done shedding. Probably many cycles over.\nThe only positive is that seen from the front, you can\u2019t even guess I\u2019m fighting hair loss.",

So by the time I was 24 I was already shaving my head because it looked awful even buzzed. The first pic I linked was a year earlier, at 23.\n\nAt 24 I started min, more as an experiment. I didn\u2019t expect much but I had explosive growth in 3-4 months. I started visibly thinning at 16, and my hair went back to when I was 15. It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth.

The problem is sides can creep up at any time and force you to stop.  This is where things get dicey and the post syndrome is no joke.  Propecia isn't linked to suicide due to some hypnotic effect on the weak-minded, it's due to the massive and relentless physical decay some experience after stopping the drug that can't be shaved off or covered with a cap.  DHT is an important male hormone involved in a lot more processes than the drug literature covers.  Just something to be aware of.",

(sorry if i got this wrong) my advice if you\u2019re young is to just own it and shave your head. it will be weird at first (trust me) but a clean crew cut looks way better than clinging on to what hair you have left. regardless i haven\u2019t seen your hair and i\u2019m also not a doctor. i did fin for 6-7 months and saw mild improvement. it works for some people but you have to be consistent with it and not skip days. you\u2019re only 19, don\u2019t let hair rule your life or you will just get more frustrated. work with what you\u2019ve got. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing something about it early. i really wish the best for you",

Or will minoxidil work for me? Honestly I've accepted I'm going bald but man im on verge of tears every time I see my hair on my hand. As for medication I'll be consistent the fear of loosing my hair will keep me in check, I've considered hair transplant as well but idk if I can get it at this age.",

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

Then I started at .25mg per day.  I've noticed zero sides so far and plan to increase to .5mg starting in October, then 1mg in December.\n\nIMO even though finasteride is a fairly safe drug, one should always get bloods tested and take precautions when messing with their hormones.",

Listening to their reports of side effects and then instinctively blaming the drug without evidence violates #2.\n\n\nYour example of Covid-19 vaccine is not the best example, as it has become a highly politicized and demonized treatment in the lay public discourse. People are primed to interpret every little problem they come across as a Covid-19 vaccine side effect, because many unscientific voices are telling them to do so and inducing large-scale fear responses. This muddies the water when it comes to \"believing\" someone's report of a side effect. Still, medical professionals should listen to patients who claim side effects and investigate those that are plausible. It would likely not change the risk/benefit ratio with the Covid-19 vaccination, however.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of finasteride is not something I am personally familiar with. It sounds like, for whatever reason, you are questioning medical professional's ability to evaluate this ratio for their patients. That said, if a patient really wants the treatment, they can get it, as OP obviously did.",

I started to take whole 1mg tab per day , with in 1-2 months I started to get horrible results , very bad Erectile D. I threw away all pills and mino. I keep loosing hair but at slow rate I started to take alertnative methods such as saw palmetto capsules etc, I bought hairmax in 2010 , it helped upto a certain extent but not completely. now I heard they having topical finestride, I am 42 now. I am not completely bald but 2 patches ,one on crown and another on front , I am taking topical finestride with minoxidil once a day , no side effect, zero. I do not know if I should go for 2 times a day or not . once seems not big results though but no sides either . I am using SALT COMPOSITIONMinoxidil (5% w/v) + Azelaic Acid (1.5% w/v) + Tretinoin (0.01% w/v) in the morning and Minoxidil (5% w/v) + Finasteride (0.1% w/v) in the morning. plus also taking biotin 5000 mcg per day and washing with pharama grade caffeine shampoo . and yes harimax 2-3 times in a week.  I also observed rosemary oil works too.",

My problem has always been the crown, but the scalp in general was bad enough that I was shaving. Also because my hairline hasn\u2019t changed in shape nor thickness since I was a child, it looked weird 3 days after shaving. Thin scalp with a dark, thicker frontal line.\nAnyway, in those three months I went from shaved to full head of hair. Some colleagues asked if I was wearing a wig, even though they saw my hair growing in time.\nThen I started finasteride and had a big shed two months in and lost ground. Since then I haven\u2019t made progress because I get another shed before the situation can improve at all. My last brutal shed started 3 months ago and stopped like 3 weeks ago. I mean I went from tons of hair in my hands when I wash it (every day) to barely any. But I think I\u2019m starting another already. Like every 3 months.\nI think, as diffuse thinners, we\u2019re bound to shed for a very long time because most of our hair needs to be replaced, as most is affected by DHT. Compared to someone who only has a receding hairline, but no problem elsewhere.\nAll I can do is to wait for all of my DHT affected scalp hair to be done shedding. Probably many cycles over.\nThe only positive is that seen from the front, you can\u2019t even guess I\u2019m fighting hair loss.",

I didn\u2019t expect much but I had explosive growth in 3-4 months. I started visibly thinning at 16, and my hair went back to when I was 15. It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth. Eventually I accepted that 10mg spread throughout the body can\u2019t give me the results from 100mg concentrated on the scalp. Now I\u2019m certain of it, since two months back on topical I\u2019m already definitely improving.",

(sorry if i got this wrong) my advice if you\u2019re young is to just own it and shave your head. it will be weird at first (trust me) but a clean crew cut looks way better than clinging on to what hair you have left. regardless i haven\u2019t seen your hair and i\u2019m also not a doctor. i did fin for 6-7 months and saw mild improvement. it works for some people but you have to be consistent with it and not skip days. you\u2019re only 19, don\u2019t let hair rule your life or you will just get more frustrated. work with what you\u2019ve got. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing something about it early. i really wish the best for you",

Or will minoxidil work for me? Honestly I've accepted I'm going bald but man im on verge of tears every time I see my hair on my hand.

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

Then I started at .25mg per day.  I've noticed zero sides so far and plan to increase to .5mg starting in October, then 1mg in December.\n\nIMO even though finasteride is a fairly safe drug, one should always get bloods tested and take precautions when messing with their hormones.",

Listening to their reports of side effects and then instinctively blaming the drug without evidence violates #2.\n\n\nYour example of Covid-19 vaccine is not the best example, as it has become a highly politicized and demonized treatment in the lay public discourse. People are primed to interpret every little problem they come across as a Covid-19 vaccine side effect, because many unscientific voices are telling them to do so and inducing large-scale fear responses. This muddies the water when it comes to \"believing\" someone's report of a side effect. Still, medical professionals should listen to patients who claim side effects and investigate those that are plausible. It would likely not change the risk/benefit ratio with the Covid-19 vaccination, however.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of finasteride is not something I am personally familiar with. It sounds like, for whatever reason, you are questioning medical professional's ability to evaluate this ratio for their patients. That said, if a patient really wants the treatment, they can get it, as OP obviously did.",

I started to take whole 1mg tab per day , with in 1-2 months I started to get horrible results , very bad Erectile D. I threw away all pills and mino. I keep loosing hair but at slow rate I started to take alertnative methods such as saw palmetto capsules etc, I bought hairmax in 2010 , it helped upto a certain extent but not completely. now I heard they having topical finestride, I am 42 now. I am not completely bald but 2 patches ,one on crown and another on front , I am taking topical finestride with minoxidil once a day , no side effect, zero. I do not know if I should go for 2 times a day or not . once seems not big results though but no sides either . I am using SALT COMPOSITIONMinoxidil (5% w/v) + Azelaic Acid (1.5% w/v) + Tretinoin (0.01% w/v) in the morning and Minoxidil (5% w/v) + Finasteride (0.1% w/v) in the morning. plus also taking biotin 5000 mcg per day and washing with pharama grade caffeine shampoo . and yes harimax 2-3 times in a week.  I also observed rosemary oil works too.",

My problem has always been the crown, but the scalp in general was bad enough that I was shaving. Also because my hairline hasn\u2019t changed in shape nor thickness since I was a child, it looked weird 3 days after shaving. Thin scalp with a dark, thicker frontal line.\nAnyway, in those three months I went from shaved to full head of hair. Some colleagues asked if I was wearing a wig, even though they saw my hair growing in time.\nThen I started finasteride and had a big shed two months in and lost ground. Since then I haven\u2019t made progress because I get another shed before the situation can improve at all. My last brutal shed started 3 months ago and stopped like 3 weeks ago. I mean I went from tons of hair in my hands when I wash it (every day) to barely any. But I think I\u2019m starting another already. Like every 3 months.\nI think, as diffuse thinners, we\u2019re bound to shed for a very long time because most of our hair needs to be replaced, as most is affected by DHT. Compared to someone who only has a receding hairline, but no problem elsewhere.\nAll I can do is to wait for all of my DHT affected scalp hair to be done shedding. Probably many cycles over.\nThe only positive is that seen from the front, you can\u2019t even guess I\u2019m fighting hair loss.",

I didn\u2019t expect much but I had explosive growth in 3-4 months. I started visibly thinning at 16, and my hair went back to when I was 15. It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth. Eventually I accepted that 10mg spread throughout the body can\u2019t give me the results from 100mg concentrated on the scalp.

(sorry if i got this wrong) my advice if you\u2019re young is to just own it and shave your head. it will be weird at first (trust me) but a clean crew cut looks way better than clinging on to what hair you have left. regardless i haven\u2019t seen your hair and i\u2019m also not a doctor. i did fin for 6-7 months and saw mild improvement. it works for some people but you have to be consistent with it and not skip days. you\u2019re only 19, don\u2019t let hair rule your life or you will just get more frustrated. work with what you\u2019ve got. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing something about it early. i really wish the best for you",

Or will minoxidil work for me? Honestly I've accepted I'm going bald but man im on verge of tears every time I see my hair on my hand.

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

Listening to their reports of side effects and then instinctively blaming the drug without evidence violates #2.\n\n\nYour example of Covid-19 vaccine is not the best example, as it has become a highly politicized and demonized treatment in the lay public discourse. People are primed to interpret every little problem they come across as a Covid-19 vaccine side effect, because many unscientific voices are telling them to do so and inducing large-scale fear responses. This muddies the water when it comes to \"believing\" someone's report of a side effect. Still, medical professionals should listen to patients who claim side effects and investigate those that are plausible. It would likely not change the risk/benefit ratio with the Covid-19 vaccination, however.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of finasteride is not something I am personally familiar with. It sounds like, for whatever reason, you are questioning medical professional's ability to evaluate this ratio for their patients. That said, if a patient really wants the treatment, they can get it, as OP obviously did.",

My problem has always been the crown, but the scalp in general was bad enough that I was shaving. Also because my hairline hasn\u2019t changed in shape nor thickness since I was a child, it looked weird 3 days after shaving. Thin scalp with a dark, thicker frontal line.\nAnyway, in those three months I went from shaved to full head of hair. Some colleagues asked if I was wearing a wig, even though they saw my hair growing in time.\nThen I started finasteride and had a big shed two months in and lost ground. Since then I haven\u2019t made progress because I get another shed before the situation can improve at all. My last brutal shed started 3 months ago and stopped like 3 weeks ago. I mean I went from tons of hair in my hands when I wash it (every day) to barely any. But I think I\u2019m starting another already. Like every 3 months.\nI think, as diffuse thinners, we\u2019re bound to shed for a very long time because most of our hair needs to be replaced, as most is affected by DHT. Compared to someone who only has a receding hairline, but no problem elsewhere.\nAll I can do is to wait for all of my DHT affected scalp hair to be done shedding. Probably many cycles over.\nThe only positive is that seen from the front, you can\u2019t even guess I\u2019m fighting hair loss.",

So by the time I was 24 I was already shaving my head because it looked awful even buzzed. The first pic I linked was a year earlier, at 23.\n\nAt 24 I started min, more as an experiment. I didn\u2019t expect much but I had explosive growth in 3-4 months. I started visibly thinning at 16, and my hair went back to when I was 15. It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth. Eventually I accepted that 10mg spread throughout the body can\u2019t give me the results from 100mg concentrated on the scalp. Now I\u2019m certain of it, since two months back on topical I\u2019m already definitely improving.",

(sorry if i got this wrong) my advice if you\u2019re young is to just own it and shave your head. it will be weird at first (trust me) but a clean crew cut looks way better than clinging on to what hair you have left. regardless i haven\u2019t seen your hair and i\u2019m also not a doctor. i did fin for 6-7 months and saw mild improvement. it works for some people but you have to be consistent with it and not skip days. you\u2019re only 19, don\u2019t let hair rule your life or you will just get more frustrated. work with what you\u2019ve got. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing something about it early. i really wish the best for you",

Or will minoxidil work for me? Honestly I've accepted I'm going bald but man im on verge of tears every time I see my hair on my hand. As for medication I'll be consistent the fear of loosing my hair will keep me in check, I've considered hair transplant as well but idk if I can get it at this age.",

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

Listening to their reports of side effects and then instinctively blaming the drug without evidence violates #2.\n\n\nYour example of Covid-19 vaccine is not the best example, as it has become a highly politicized and demonized treatment in the lay public discourse. People are primed to interpret every little problem they come across as a Covid-19 vaccine side effect, because many unscientific voices are telling them to do so and inducing large-scale fear responses. This muddies the water when it comes to \"believing\" someone's report of a side effect. Still, medical professionals should listen to patients who claim side effects and investigate those that are plausible. It would likely not change the risk/benefit ratio with the Covid-19 vaccination, however.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of finasteride is not something I am personally familiar with. It sounds like, for whatever reason, you are questioning medical professional's ability to evaluate this ratio for their patients. That said, if a patient really wants the treatment, they can get it, as OP obviously did.",

(sorry if i got this wrong) my advice if you\u2019re young is to just own it and shave your head. it will be weird at first (trust me) but a clean crew cut looks way better than clinging on to what hair you have left. regardless i haven\u2019t seen your hair and i\u2019m also not a doctor. i did fin for 6-7 months and saw mild improvement. it works for some people but you have to be consistent with it and not skip days. you\u2019re only 19, don\u2019t let hair rule your life or you will just get more frustrated. work with what you\u2019ve got. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing something about it early. i really wish the best for you",

Or will minoxidil work for me? Honestly I've accepted I'm going bald but man im on verge of tears every time I see my hair on my hand. As for medication I'll be consistent the fear of loosing my hair will keep me in check, I've considered hair transplant as well but idk if I can get it at this age.",

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

Listening to their reports of side effects and then instinctively blaming the drug without evidence violates #2.\n\n\nYour example of Covid-19 vaccine is not the best example, as it has become a highly politicized and demonized treatment in the lay public discourse. People are primed to interpret every little problem they come across as a Covid-19 vaccine side effect, because many unscientific voices are telling them to do so and inducing large-scale fear responses. This muddies the water when it comes to \"believing\" someone's report of a side effect. Still, medical professionals should listen to patients who claim side effects and investigate those that are plausible. It would likely not change the risk/benefit ratio with the Covid-19 vaccination, however.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of finasteride is not something I am personally familiar with. It sounds like, for whatever reason, you are questioning medical professional's ability to evaluate this ratio for their patients. That said, if a patient really wants the treatment, they can get it, as OP obviously did.",

So by the time I was 24 I was already shaving my head because it looked awful even buzzed. The first pic I linked was a year earlier, at 23.\n\nAt 24 I started min, more as an experiment. I didn\u2019t expect much but I had explosive growth in 3-4 months. I started visibly thinning at 16, and my hair went back to when I was 15. It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth. Eventually I accepted that 10mg spread throughout the body can\u2019t give me the results from 100mg concentrated on the scalp. Now I\u2019m certain of it, since two months back on topical I\u2019m already definitely improving.",

(sorry if i got this wrong) my advice if you\u2019re young is to just own it and shave your head. it will be weird at first (trust me) but a clean crew cut looks way better than clinging on to what hair you have left. regardless i haven\u2019t seen your hair and i\u2019m also not a doctor. i did fin for 6-7 months and saw mild improvement. it works for some people but you have to be consistent with it and not skip days. you\u2019re only 19, don\u2019t let hair rule your life or you will just get more frustrated. work with what you\u2019ve got. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re doing something about it early. i really wish the best for you",

Or will minoxidil work for me? Honestly I've accepted I'm going bald but man im on verge of tears every time I see my hair on my hand.

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth. Eventually I accepted that 10mg spread throughout the body can\u2019t give me the results from 100mg concentrated on the scalp.

Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",

I didn\u2019t expect much but I had explosive growth in 3-4 months. I started visibly thinning at 16, and my hair went back to when I was 15. It was honestly hard to believe even looking in the mirror. At that point I was able to get on fin too, but switched to oral for ease of use. As I said, over several months I kept losing ground until I was almost back to baseline. I gave it so long because I trusted the word of mouth. Eventually I accepted that 10mg spread throughout the body can\u2019t give me the results from 100mg concentrated on the scalp. Now I\u2019m certain of it, since two months back on topical I\u2019m already definitely improving.",

As someone has already pointed out to you, it doesn\u2019t make the room colder - it just moves the air around so it\u2019s not stale. \n\nYou\u2019re either incredibly stupid or trolling. Either way, it\u2019s unfortunately not a good look for you. I genuinely wish you the best in life man. You\u2019re already on a pretty rough trajectory. Maybe consider looking for a big brother program or something in your area? There are a lot of great role models and mentors out there that can help you out. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is give it a chance. You don\u2019t need to go through the rest of your life holding on to so much anger, hatred, and judgment. In the case of if you\u2019re just trolling, they can help with that too. Right now you think it\u2019s funny to spread toxicity online, which will certainly get you nowhere in life. Having good mentorship can help with that too. \n\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste, and it currently sounds like you\u2019re wasting yours.  \n\nhttps://www.bbbs.org/",
