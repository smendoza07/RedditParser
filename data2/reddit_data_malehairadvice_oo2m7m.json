            "body": "I tried to keep track of the days to be more precise, but I lost count around month 5. But yeah, a lot of you have been asking for an update\u2014 so here it is!\n\nMy findings:\n\n1. This stuff actually works if you start early enough and commit to taking it every day. \n\n2. Erectile dysfunction is NOT guaranteed. Never happened to me, but I know that risk is a major deterrent to a lot of people. \n\n3. Your hair will grow back (to varying extent), but it will never be the same as it was before. My coverage is pretty *decent* now but the texture is a bit odd, and the actual quality of the regrown hairs isn\u2019t fantastic. The fibers are thin, slightly frizzy, and seem to not like growing past 5in in length (at least in my case).\n\n4. Despite all the new growth; my hair looks horrible when it\u2019s wet. Showers, pools, and getting caught in the rain are all slight fears of mine if others are around. \n\n5. It feels amazing to not be forced to plan outfits around what hats I have available. For the first time in two years I feel comfortable going outside uncovered and it\u2019s sooooo nice. \n\nAnd yes, before any of you ask\u2014 my eyebrows ARE different but it\u2019s the same guy in both photos, I promise (I started coloring them with beard dye because no matter what the insecurities never end, haha).",

This is a vasodilator so it makes sense. Those are the common ones that you eventually develop, one, two, all of them, or new ones that no one saw coming. I think minox is better for the people who want to grow a beard, because that hair is permanent, so you take a year or two and leave it.\n\nFin sides depend mostly on your life. I felt sexual undesire for 2 weeks, then it left, months later I felt and increase in sexual desire but probably was because I started exercising hard. Some people feel various things, but most realistically, if you are a sad anxious balding man living a life going downhill and then you take something like fin and expect results in a month, you will probably pin every litle thing your feel to the drug, and it will be a lot of them because you will be hyper aware. Fin can also develop ginecomastia if you are kinda on the fatty side of the family, eat shit and don't move a muscle.",

You better not know. I shouldn't even mention it because its extremely rare, but its in my knowledge and I can't lie.",

Also my endocrinologist told me finasteride can effect your liver, but since I get my blood work checked regularly, she gave me the green light to take the medication as i am healthy. Just a little heads up in case any of y\u2019all have any liver issues.",

Leading to my \u201cbefore\u201d photos back in November. \n\nI totally understand your skepticism, I probably wouldn\u2019t believe it either. But all of those photos are clearly taken in the same room, and I\u2019ve been taking two different medications, vitamins, and derma-rolling for 8 months now and was lucky enough to restore my hair back to how it was in 2018 (if I started earlier I probably could\u2019ve fully reversed it). I\u2019m at work at the moment, but once I\u2019m home I\u2019ll find some screen grabs from a video project I\u2019ve been shooting for the last few years and we have some scenes where we failed to cover my bald spots.

It can give you much thicker regrowth than with just minoxidil. It works great for non-responders or those who get underwhelming results from min alone. Therefore, it could work even better for hyper-responders. You should get a dermapen with 12-pin cartridges at 1-1.5mm depths at a 1x a week to once every other week frequency. You can decrease the frequency after you've been doing it for a while. Anecdotally, microneedling results can stay around a lot longer than min results and (possibly) keep min assisted hairs around even if you quit min. Take the previous sentence with a grain of salt but there are several examples online of significant microneedling results, with and without min.  Though it usually takes longer than min (up to 6-12 months), the outcome could last a lot longer; ostensibly 2-7 years, the average length of a growth cycle. Though you should do your own research before trying any alternative methods, I'd highly consider it as someone who has greatly benefited from it. You should check out More Plates More Dates on Youtube for highly detailed and scientific advice on this matter, and as well as the myriad examples on r/tressless.",

This is a vasodilator so it makes sense. Those are the common ones that you eventually develop, one, two, all of them, or new ones that no one saw coming. I think minox is better for the people who want to grow a beard, because that hair is permanent, so you take a year or two and leave it.\n\nFin sides depend mostly on your life. I felt sexual undesire for 2 weeks, then it left, months later I felt and increase in sexual desire but probably was because I started exercising hard. Some people feel various things, but most realistically, if you are a sad anxious balding man living a life going downhill and then you take something like fin and expect results in a month, you will probably pin every litle thing your feel to the drug, and it will be a lot of them because you will be hyper aware. Fin can also develop ginecomastia if you are kinda on the fatty side of the family, eat shit and don't move a muscle.",

Started finasteride about a week ago and the headaches are about the same as I felt with minox. I just know they\u2019re side effects I gotta deal with for a bit and they\u2019ll go away. Also my endocrinologist told me finasteride can effect your liver, but since I get my blood work checked regularly, she gave me the green light to take the medication as i am healthy. Just a little heads up in case any of y\u2019all have any liver issues.",

Leading to my \u201cbefore\u201d photos back in November. \n\nI totally understand your skepticism, I probably wouldn\u2019t believe it either. But all of those photos are clearly taken in the same room, and I\u2019ve been taking two different medications, vitamins, and derma-rolling for 8 months now and was lucky enough to restore my hair back to how it was in 2018 (if I started earlier I probably could\u2019ve fully reversed it). I\u2019m at work at the moment, but once I\u2019m home I\u2019ll find some screen grabs from a video project I\u2019ve been shooting for the last few years and we have some scenes where we failed to cover my bald spots.

This is a vasodilator so it makes sense. Those are the common ones that you eventually develop, one, two, all of them, or new ones that no one saw coming. I think minox is better for the people who want to grow a beard, because that hair is permanent, so you take a year or two and leave it.\n\nFin sides depend mostly on your life. I felt sexual undesire for 2 weeks, then it left, months later I felt and increase in sexual desire but probably was because I started exercising hard. Some people feel various things, but most realistically, if you are a sad anxious balding man living a life going downhill and then you take something like fin and expect results in a month, you will probably pin every litle thing your feel to the drug, and it will be a lot of them because you will be hyper aware.

I knew what angles I could use to cover it, I was FAR from a full head of hair. Genetics caused the slow thinning from 2016-2019, but 2020 brought the stress-induced hairloss in large chunks. Leading to my \u201cbefore\u201d photos back in November. \n\nI totally understand your skepticism, I probably wouldn\u2019t believe it either. But all of those photos are clearly taken in the same room, and I\u2019ve been taking two different medications, vitamins, and derma-rolling for 8 months now and was lucky enough to restore my hair back to how it was in 2018 (if I started earlier I probably could\u2019ve fully reversed it). I\u2019m at work at the moment, but once I\u2019m home I\u2019ll find some screen grabs from a video project I\u2019ve been shooting for the last few years and we have some scenes where we failed to cover my bald spots.

This is a vasodilator so it makes sense. Those are the common ones that you eventually develop, one, two, all of them, or new ones that no one saw coming. I think minox is better for the people who want to grow a beard, because that hair is permanent, so you take a year or two and leave it.\n\nFin sides depend mostly on your life. I felt sexual undesire for 2 weeks, then it left, months later I felt and increase in sexual desire but probably was because I started exercising hard. Some people feel various things, but most realistically, if you are a sad anxious balding man living a life going downhill and then you take something like fin and expect results in a month, you will probably pin every litle thing your feel to the drug, and it will be a lot of them because you will be hyper aware. Fin can also develop ginecomastia if you are kinda on the fatty side of the family, eat shit and don't move a muscle.",

This is a vasodilator so it makes sense. Those are the common ones that you eventually develop, one, two, all of them, or new ones that no one saw coming. I think minox is better for the people who want to grow a beard, because that hair is permanent, so you take a year or two and leave it.\n\nFin sides depend mostly on your life. I felt sexual undesire for 2 weeks, then it left, months later I felt and increase in sexual desire but probably was because I started exercising hard. Some people feel various things, but most realistically, if you are a sad anxious balding man living a life going downhill and then you take something like fin and expect results in a month, you will probably pin every litle thing your feel to the drug, and it will be a lot of them because you will be hyper aware. Fin can also develop ginecomastia if you are kinda on the fatty side of the family, eat shit and don't move a muscle.",
