The goal was to get Kurama; Obito murdered Hiruzen's wife, and then unleashed the fucking Fox on Konoha to run wild. You could argue that he couldn't just escape with the Fox, but I think Kishimoto definitely frames the attack as coming from a personal place. Obito was furious at Minato for living peacefully with a child while Rin had to die. At this point Obito was still extremely childish. Dude even knocked over the flowers Kakashi left at Rin's grave lmao",

The goal was to get Kurama; Obito murdered Hiruzen's wife, and then unleashed the fucking Fox on Konoha to run wild. You could argue that he couldn't just escape with the Fox, but I think Kishimoto definitely frames the attack as coming from a personal place. Obito was furious at Minato for living peacefully with a child while Rin had to die. At this point Obito was still extremely childish. Dude even knocked over the flowers Kakashi left at Rin's grave lmao",

Obito was furious at Minato for living peacefully with a child while Rin had to die. At this point Obito was still extremely childish.

Obito was furious at Minato for living peacefully with a child while Rin had to die. At this point Obito was still extremely childish. Dude even knocked over the flowers Kakashi left at Rin's grave lmao",

He had barely used his more basic MS abilities like Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu.\nAlso, Danzo could pull the same tactic he pulled on Shisui against Itachi.\nAnd again, killing Danzo wouldn't stop the Coup.\nAnd Danzo wouldn't let Itachi put Hiruzen in a Genjutsu because Danzo wanted to have the Uchiha anihilated above everything else.\nHe ended up being an S Class criminal after the Massacre. If he was one before the Massacre, he wouldn't be able to do anything to help and a Civil War (And potentially another Great Ninja War would errupt).\nHiruzen didn't trust Itachi as much as you think pre-massacre.
