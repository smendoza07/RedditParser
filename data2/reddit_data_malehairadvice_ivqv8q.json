Most barbers are probably not going to be able to give you that same hairstyle as in the picture. You need a softer and more wavy hair type to get the top to naturally look like that.",

Grab yourself a new barber and show them the picture of the cut you wanted. Then ask the barber to give you a classic Caesar\u00a0that will grow into the cut you originally wanted. You'll be looking great all the way until the new cut grows in. Also try out an [awesome hair cream](https://peteandpedro.com/products/cream) to give your hair that natural wavy look you wanted.",
