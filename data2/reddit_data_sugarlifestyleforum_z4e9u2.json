    "body": "A follow up on my post about my SB who was sexually assaulted.  She reported him to the sheriffs department.  I talked to an investigator from there who just wanted some corroboration on something.  Of course they won\u2019t tell you anything about an ongoing investigation.  He has already been evicted from the house and she is doing better.\nWomen who complain of sexual assault should be believed until there is evidence to the contrary.\nIn addition if she is a scammer/rinser she is a bad one.  I said we went on 4  platonic dates, not 4 paid platonic dates.  After our M&G she got a monetary gift from me.  No other dates were compensated.  I did buy her a new tire, because her tire was slashed.  I was with her when she found it and went with her to the tire store.  She got a couple of other gifts from me, but she didn\u2019t ask for them.  The grand total spent (excluding the dates) was less than half the weekly allowance we had agreed to.",

And believe me, I\u2019ve gathered enough resources to where my focus in life is giving it away, and not for a tax break, because of the empathy that helped me so much. I can be a f\u2019ing prick when someone deserves it, but don\u2019t try to act like you\u2019ve got to be a full blown A-hole 24/7 to gather resources. I eat competition like that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because they\u2019re predictable.

I\u2019m a man, captain of multiple industries, VERY empathetic of everyone who deserves it and I lead my employees with a healthy dose of it and that\u2019s why the vast majority have been on for over 7 years, and very many over 20 years. And believe me, I\u2019ve gathered enough resources to where my focus in life is giving it away, and not for a tax break, because of the empathy that helped me so much. I can be a f\u2019ing prick when someone deserves it, but don\u2019t try to act like you\u2019ve got to be a full blown A-hole 24/7 to gather resources. I eat competition like that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because they\u2019re predictable. Also, it takes AT LEAST a little empathy to have a proper relationship, even a sugar one, with the lucky person who you\u2019re with. Again, if you don\u2019t have that, I feel for whomever your with, because no amount of money is worth it.",

Siting that because she didn\u2019t reply to his offer to talk to a retired sheriff that she was lying and practically taking this man for all he had. When he NEVER said she was demanding money from him.\n\nThere are certainly people out there who *would* lie about SA for the prospect of delaying intimacy or scamming. But there are certainly more people who have actually gone through sexual assault and if a person says they were assaulted, man or woman, one should assume they are telling the truth until there is evidence otherwise.",

And believe me, I\u2019ve gathered enough resources to where my focus in life is giving it away, and not for a tax break, because of the empathy that helped me so much. I can be a f\u2019ing prick when someone deserves it, but don\u2019t try to act like you\u2019ve got to be a full blown A-hole 24/7 to gather resources. I eat competition like that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because they\u2019re predictable. Also, it takes AT LEAST a little empathy to have a proper relationship, even a sugar one, with the lucky person who you\u2019re with.

I can be a f\u2019ing prick when someone deserves it, but don\u2019t try to act like you\u2019ve got to be a full blown A-hole 24/7 to gather resources. I eat competition like that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because they\u2019re predictable.
