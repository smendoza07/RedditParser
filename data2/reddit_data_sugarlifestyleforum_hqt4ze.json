    "body": "So many posts talk about difficulties and challenges we have in the lifestyle.  Here is a tiny story from the other direction.  \n\nSB and I are remote.  She is in town this week.  Having lunch and I mention that I am having a discussion about joining a Board of Directors for a company where I know the owners.  She is listening with interest.  \n\nThen I tell her that the company is in her city.  Meaning travel for me there. As soon as I said that, her face lit up, she broke into a huge smile, and let out this little squeal. \n\nThat spontaneity and enthusiasm was just so charming.  Totally made my day.",

When she presses for more time together, you know it has nothing to do with a quick financial gain.  That lunch was two days ago.   Yesterday we spent several hours of private time together.  We had tentatively set up a Thursday date, but she told me that we need to schedule something sooner, because she didn\u2019t want to wait that long before seeing each other again.  No clock watching or going through the motions here.\n\nConversely, when we can\u2019t see each other for a little while due to her remoteness, she doesn\u2019t get financially stressed because of it.   I am comfortable because over 15 months we have a history where trust has developed.  Over that time, I can\u2019t recall a single time where she has turned down a request to meet, travel together, or to get on a FaceTime call.  \n\nNot keeping score is great.",

We had tentatively set up a Thursday date, but she told me that we need to schedule something sooner, because she didn\u2019t want to wait that long before seeing each other again.  No clock watching or going through the motions here.\n\nConversely, when we can\u2019t see each other for a little while due to her remoteness, she doesn\u2019t get financially stressed because of it.   I am comfortable because over 15 months we have a history where trust has developed.  Over that time, I can\u2019t recall a single time where she has turned down a request to meet, travel together, or to get on a FaceTime call.  \n\nNot keeping score is great.",
