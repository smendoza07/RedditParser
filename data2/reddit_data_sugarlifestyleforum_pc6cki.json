    "body": "You all seem to complain how shitty SA is or has become, and then in the same breath many MANY of you are guilty of doing these following things. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060insist on no gifts in m&amp;g dates *unless* the woman meet a zillion qualifiers and it's a paltry gas/uber amounts only (and even then it's not the norm IME anymore, the norm in many SBs experience is $0)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060expect us to show up to do a dance and a show for the price of a coffee date (whatever happened to lunch or dinner dates?? Oh no, you must be a FOOD RINSER \ud83d\ude44)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060insist on nonsense \"one-bedroom\" equivalence per month (that's CHEAP, women want to be in the sugar bowl to advance and have a more secured financial future, not just to placate their *bare minimum* living costs; and that's what the Money Talks thread has revealed to me - barely bare minimum...)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060talk about \"market rate\" as if we are products instead of people\n\n\u2022\t\u2060zero show of generosity / \"no money\" given at all and \"arrangement\" doesn't happen \"until intimacy happens\" \ud83d\ude44 and then simultaneously calls it a relationship. Puleeeze spare us the hypocrisy. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060laughs and questions the \u201caudacity\u201d of a woman expecting a birthday gift (oh no, her birthday happens to be only weeks into the SR... sorry no gifts, has to be 6 or 12 months or more before any gift happens! \ud83d\ude44) \n\n\u2022\t\u2060and so many more salt and salt adjacent mentalities and behaviors\n\nMy dudes, it's not rocket science. You show us your generosity, legitimate women will see you and reciprocate you. Will you lose a few hundred here and there to *gasp* rinsers? Sure probably, but if you are so calculating that you can't risk or view that as part of the cost of being in the sugar bowl, what does that say about you? And, if you continuously gets \"rinsed\" then the problem is more likely to be you / your filtering.\n\nIf you treat us with a swatch of contempt and disposability, don't be surprised we are disheartened and aren't enthused to show up for a coffee date. We can buy lots of coffee with our own money.\n\n**In other words, stand out from the salts and splendas (and pic collectors and time wasters and scammers), or you will be treated as one until you act otherwise, coz it's hard to tell anymore.**",

            "body": "For me this is all about expectations. I expect SA to be a shit show and it is, but it is the best we have right now. SDs and SBs alike are acting all surprised. You shouldn't be surprised it is mental. I expect that I may lose a few hundred dollars here and there but it doesn't amount to even 1% of my monthly income so why get so worked up about it! I don't feel bad as I expect it as part of the game.\n\nThe bowl has more than its fair share of rinsers, flakes, conmen, groomers, child molesters, hookers, chancers, criminals , pimps, johns, escorts, etc etc. No one should be surprised. Anywhere that money and sex are involved will be the case.\n\nThe questions is are you taking the precautions to protect yourself from the worst of the bowl whilst also accepting that you may not always be successful?\n\nSDs set a figure that you are willing to put into the bowl each month. Stick to it. If you can't afford a particular SB don't worry there will be more. Pay your SB that figure monthly, don't try and nickle and dime them. \"Saving\" a few dollars here and there. Most of the time you will win sometimes you will lose that is the game. There is risk and reward in any relationship.\n\nSBs go on the platonic no payment meet and greet. This is your chance to vet the SD before money starts to cloud issues. I would love to say that you aren't from time to time going to meet a guy who is going to pump and dump but I can't it will happen. You reduce the chances with the platonic meet and greet. Keep your panties on don't take them off under any circumstances. This is your investment in your health and safety.\n\nMain thing don't be surprised, expect anything and everything.",

Sure probably, but if you are so calculating that you can't risk or view that as part of the cost of being in the sugar bowl, what does that say about you?\n\nThis fundamentally lacks empathy. No human being, whether young, old, male female, rich, poor, generous or stingy wants to be taken advantage of. Yes, a real SD can afford losing a few undo here and there to rinsers or scammers, and I've done so myself. The loss of the $ is not the main issue. It's the gross feeling of being played or used that sticks with you, and really does not feel good at all, especially coming from someone you hoped to build a mutually affectionate bond with. It just really, really sucks on a human level, and to dismiss it with \"gasp\", as I said, lacks empathy. It's a real concern, just as SBs have their own concerns (some much more serious) that shouldn't be treated so flippantly.\n\nI'm guessing the gas money, or having to pay for your own coffee when you showed up early weren't make or break sums to you, either, but it absolutely sucks those POTs weren't gentlemen and didn't step up to the plate. I certainly wouldn't dismiss those with a \"gasp\" and some eye roll emojis, and neither should you trivialize getting rinsed for a few hundo.",

Generosity and trust naturally flow once that comfort is built.  Current SB and I each had our rules of engagement at the start.  Rules that would apparently get me thrown away by OP and all the associated cheerleaders.  We each respected those rules, and grew into a real relationship.  Which has endured for 2.5 years now.  Those rules are now long gone, and I am sure the way my SB is compensated now would pass the scrutiny of even the most jaded skeptics here.  \n\nAs I said elsewhere, I am sick of the people who show up here and carry on as if THEY are the authority, and that their\u2019s is the only truth.  I am likely making it worse by posting and delivering the attention that these types seek.\n\nCurrent SB and I had multiple platonic dates to start.  At really great restaurants for dinner and lunches.  She never expected to be paid for those dates.  It was never an issue that even came up.  But she wanted time to understand who I was before even thinking about going further.  Apparently, my obvious enjoyment of just spending time with her, and zero pressure on the intimacy side, made her decide to proceed.  And for her to persevere when her initial allowance requests where well beyond what I was willing to do.  Those were our rules and they worked.",

But I think you are too much associating a high dollar value to success.  \n\nI've never found that drastically increasing my allowance amount - led to better connections.  It lead to more 1-2 date encounters with high PPMs, with really hot women, that were not in any way attracted to anything but the amount of the PPM.  \n\nIt just so happens - the monthly allowance I offer - is roughly the price on a 2bedroom apartment in the nicest part of town.  But I'm sure it's still Splenda by your definition.\n\nI don't gift for a simple M&G;  the allowance will start once we've agreed to move forward with intimacy.  That said - I'm fine with it taking a couple of intimate dates for full on sex to happen.  As long as there is progression.  First intimacy does not have to equate to full blown sex.  \n\nThe birthday gift thing... well, you've been around the block enough, you start to recognize the scam.  In my mind though this is easily mitigated by trading IDs.  That's what I've done with my current SB (we did on the first date) - we both know each other's birthdays.  \n\nOTOH, I often laugh (and call out) the men on this sub - that are expecting a real SGF relationship to develop while insisting on PPM.  \n\nMy point here is - while you focus so much on the money - I don't think it's that simple.  I may be on the lower end budget wise - but have never struggled to find what I'm looking for.",

What you think the truth is, what I think the truth is, and the actual truth which is usually somewhere in between.\n\nI personally think SA sucks because there are too many SB profiles that are either: (1) fake; (2) scam profiles; (3) outright prostitutes; or (4) girls that I wouldn\u2019t date under any circumstances.  It used to be better.  It\u2019s gotten significantly worse. I have better luck meeting someone the old fashioned way.\n\nTo address your points, I have no actual experience as to how other SD\u2019s operate.  From what I see on this subreddit, too many guys are just excited to go to a M&G.  Too many think it\u2019s a formula and a transaction and not a relationship.  But guess what?  I see that from just as many, if not more SBs.  On this forum, many are clear that it\u2019s only about \u201cthe Benjies\u201d as you like to put it.  Many are clockwatchers or calendar watchers.  Asking for a one-off additional meet or a longer date has to be met with a commensurate additional payment that is equal to or greater than the time for which you you are being compensated.  In other words, treat it like a business and you\u2019ll likely get treated as a \u201cvendor\u201d. \n\nIt goes back to the golden rule. Treat people how you would like to be treated.  And be reasonable in your expectations.",

Sure probably, but if you are so calculating that you can't risk or view that as part of the cost of being in the sugar bowl, what does that say about you? And, if you continuously gets \"rinsed\" then the problem is more likely to be you / your filtering.\n\nIn one sentence you admonish us for the way we vet and filter and in the very next one you admonish us for not vetting and filtering good enough. \n\nThis is a both sides thing. I dont blame or think less of women who do or want X Y and Z in their vetting processes, I just accept we arent compatible and move on. Women should do the same. If you arent compatible, move on and try to find someone who is. \n\nThe problem is on both sides that what may appear a legitimate request with good faith intention can be exploited by scammers. \n\nIf there were no scammers id have no problem even giving a girl a whole month's allowance upfront, doing paid meet and greets, etc etc. Thing is theres plently of women looking to exploit that and rinse a guy. The same way theres guy scammers who do analgous things to sbs. \n\nThe same way sbs put up all these walls after getting burnt, the same way SDs are going to. Dont criticize us when you do the same things. \n\nFinally, Its not about the money, its about the principle. Im not going to put myself in a position to keep getting fucked over and incentivize scammers to keep doing what theyre doing. Im not going to be a mark, and you dont want to be either.",

Buy drinks for the girls, get her hair done, nails, new shirt, grocery shopping, her mom needed help with rent - all of this well outside of the arrangement and well outside her PPM+general shopping stuff we did together.\n\nAnd that's just one example. It happens to me quite a bit. Too much, really. It's hard to say no because you don't want them to become sour, and they will become sour.\n\nSo I can understand some of the other SDs being a bit more... \"stingy\" when it comes to the bowl.",

I'll commit to a lunch or dinner date if SB insists on it, but conventional wisdom is that M&Gs don't always go well (e.g., catfishes), so the option to move on quickly is preferable. \n\n>insist on nonsense \"one-bedroom\" equivalence per month (that's CHEAP, women want to be in the sugar bowl to advance and have a more secured financial future, not just to placate their bare minimum living costs; and that's what the Money Talks thread has revealed to me - barely bare minimum...)\n\nA nice one-bedroom in my city is 16xx to 24xx. \n\nI have a SB that works 40-50 hours a week on minimum wage: Her weekly take home pay is around the same as the PPM.

That's because if I start an SR with my real allowance number I get a highest bidder sugarbaby. An arrangement is supposed to be a mix of allowance and chemistry. That's why Id be the better guy than the highest bidder. In a longer SR with someone I like, who likes me, the rules and numbers go out the window. There is an old  saying that if you have the wrong motivations you makes the wrong choices.\n\n\nAs to hypocrisy. We'll come on. You could take the converse of all your points from the other side. Why shouldn't a guy pay for a meet and greet to show his interest? Well Why shouldn't she sleep with him for free to show her interest?

A lot of these girls are finding their way in the bowl where there are a lot of creeps/splendas/men looking to take advantage of young women. We probably all treat eachother like we're disposable but I worry that even subjecting myself to a lifestyle where me having a bad day could mean the lapse of my support because my SD just wanted someone who would be a fantasy girlfriend. And a lot of SD's defend shitty behavior because they're *good* SD's and don't realize that a lot of these people aren't as good as them. I know there are probably a shit ton of rinsers but I'm sure a lot of SB's requiring gifts at M&G's have been through it with enough assholes that they won't put themselves at risk without the promise of something material or financial. I don't think they should be demonized for that. I know SD's are giving up their money but we're giving up our bodies. Even with someone you really desire, a decent show of good faith and reliability in a relationship where sex is expected on the second date  or you're a rinser would probably go a long way.",

There's tons of rinsers out there who try to squeeze every dime out early on and then cast the guy way.

I'm dating interesting women who are smart, driven, enjoy their time with me, appreciate what I do do for them, and don't see a wallet where my nose ought to be. \n\nThe money makes you more attractive. But if you're selling money you are just going to attract the women who only want your money. Sell yourself. Use the money the way you'd use good manners, a nice shirt, or proper hygiene.

            "body": "I have too much respect for myself (well, save for engaging for far too long in conversations that go nowhere - nobody's perfect) to allow myself to be taken advantage of - especially if I am pulling the trigger. It's absolutely one of the worst feelings when you get, well, scammed.  It doesn't matter how little the financial damage is. I have succeeded in my life in many ways because I have learned to avoid people that wish to use me, take advantage of me, or scam me.  And the times I have failed to do that, I have gotten obliterated financially, spiritually, emotionally.\n\nGetting stood-up is bad enough.  Getting stood-up after being 'generous' and giving gas money ahead of time is an awful feeling.  Providing a guaranteed PPM to an SB and a lavish dinner date to show up - not a big deal in terms of the wallet.  It's a huge deal when 15 minutes into the date, her grandmother dies or apartment catches on fire, promises to make it up to you, and then disappears.  Until, well, you guessed it, rent time (I have more than my fair share of these dialogues).\n\nBeing generous upfront and out of the gate to someone usually just encourages bad behavior.  Gifting someone $X right off the bat that is truly no strings attached usually results in demands of $5X when the SB feels she will actually put effort into it.  Entitlement is the most likely outcome of being too generous out of the gate; not appreciation.  There are exceptions, but they are outliers at best. \n\nIn a perfect world, generosity is not taken advantage of, our actions and performance of being generous, and intelligence win the day and everyone is happy.  In the real world, not a chance - power plays often win out and unfortunately, especially at first, the SR starts off as a power play until both sides feel comfortable enough with each other to have trust - like human beings do.  And it has nothing to do with allowance or not - this forum is full of stories of SDs paying big allowances and being controlling and exhibiting nightmarish behavior.\n\nIf I offered $X or $X/2 PPM for a dinner date, I am sure everyone would show up.  But, I can't make them not diddle on their phone the whole time, make excuses, or get hit up for gas money when they are on the way.  Offer that up beforehand, 0% will show.  I'll be glad to wager with you.\n\nLastly, if new SR means paying up to 10 SBs to find the 1, no thanks. I MIGHT be ok with it if I didn't feel that many SBs are just outright there to scam.  As Judge Judy says, you can't come into court with your hands dirty.  If we could see into someone's spirit, we could tell.  But we cannot tell and under no circumstance do I feel comfortable donating to \"SBs\" that are proactively trying to scam, rinse, mislead, and exhibit classless behavior.  They do exist and they are not rare.\n\nNow with all of that being said, believe it or not, I have actually had GREAT SRs with SBs that clearly are interested in me.  And none of them demanded or required a M&G \"fee\" and as another poster said, upping the allowance amount to levels that get uncomfortable for me never improved the quality, caliber, or consistency of my SRs. My allowance/PPM range is (1) comfortable for my budget; (2) allows great dates and not relegate us to ramen noodles and Netflix; (3) makes a difference in her life, which does not include her being able to buy a private jet within the first 6 weeks.\n\nSong and dance? You've clearly never been on a first date with me. For all of the great SBs I have met in many ways, I have met many others that ended up with me sitting by myself courtside at a basketball game or holding 2 tickets to Broadway show with only 1 to be used.  These bad experiences haven't dampened my spirit to have a great first outing - great restaurant, day at the spa, or other things - personalized to the SBs liking.  Many don't show - wasting my time which is likely more valuable than hers on an hourly billing basis.  I am willing to invest my time and energy to meet someone I want to make a priority in my life; if she doesn't want to do the same, she is just not interested in me. End of story.\n\nI know exactly where I stand in the pecking order financially - which is the primary motivation for SBs to come on the site - and I refuse to arbitrarily relinquish that position up.  Generosity does not equal fiscal irresponsibility or stupidity. \n\nLastly, from your post, where you snarkily insult 'John' behavior, there is no doubt in my mind that if we talked on SA, you'd demand a M&G fee and we'd end up in bed together.  But, if I didn't want to bring the heat or guarantee your 'fee' for your presence, you wouldn't have given us the time of day.  Sounds a little hypocritical.  Btw, come on over - what do you want for your fee?  I'm waiting!\n\nP.S. - [Your story](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/o78btm/sugaring_tales_of_yesteryear_how_i_met_my/) admittedly breaks every piece of advice espoused here by SBs and SDs and is completely counter to your soapboxing post.  I'll do another wager.  Let the SBs get generous.  Hop into bed with guys she feels a connection with without discussing allowance and expectations and see how many of those turn into SRs.  Sure, good things do happen and on crazy terms.  But, even a broken clock is right twice a day.",

You probably wouldn't give him the sugar if you weren't sure you were ever getting your promised PPM so why would he give you any money (not talking about travel expenses tho) when he can't know for sure you are even planning on having sex with him? There's always this chance he will never see or hear from you again.\n\nI bet you don't like wasting your time on multiple dates with someone who isn't planning on ever giving you anything in return. Same goes for them so please don't say it's 'only a few hundreds'.

If you have your housing covered you can easily advance exponentially faster than your peers. I'm not suggesting the \"one-bedroom apt\" rule is golden I'm saying that a 1%ers lifestyle comes with hard-ass work, strategy, luck and time for most of us.\n\n\"market rate\" yes I do think this is highly depersonalizing. I see that across the board -- both men and women, with the assistance of internet anonymity, reduce their sugar partners to numbers. It's pragmatic but feels bad.\n\nI'm hearing a lot of bitterness in your post, and probably you have a zillion reasons as to why you decided to rant on here. I suggest foregoing the \"us vs them -- SBs vs SDs\" mentality. Some SDs fuck me over way worse than SBs, by simping and giving my POTs super high allowances for basically existing. Some SBs are truly helpful to me, keeping me both mentally and physically sharp. SDs are not a uniform bloc of people all raised the same way. We are as diverse as the general population (perhaps skewed towards people who take more risks in life/business, or people who are socially awkward, or married)",

Take stock of the time you spend on mindless internet junk, the phone, watching TV . OK my bad you are working in the Physics Lab.  \n\nThe chances are that your SD is not only missing out on the opportunity to earn income at a substantially higher rate but also, if he is an entrepreneur the overhead costs continue in his absence.  That's expected and ok.........  \n\nMost people can come to a pretty good feeling if there is potential for a relationship to develop over coffee or a glass or two of wine and perhaps an appetizer.  Yes, hopefully she's done some due diligence before the meet and received confirmation that there is the potential. \n\nOf course I will pay for your parking or perhaps even an uber. However, \"pay for your valuable time\"  ,  15 years of experience in arrangements has taught me that it is not a productive strategy except in very unique situations. \n\n It's not denigrating your economic value or your value as an individual but rather a process of screening out those who are unwilling to invest an hour or so in a meeting.  I don't want you to spend hours getting ready, rather I want the real you.  Yes perhaps you took the time to shower but most of all I want a rested, happy, focused you.  Cellphone stowed (after you assure your GF you are safely there) . \n\nThe allowance,  to pretend that a third party who has not met either the SD or SB, discussed their expectations and what the bring , can offer anything other than the most general advice as to what is an appropriate allowance for that arrangement is a fantasy. \n\nYes, they can talk and state that according to what they read on X site the general range of REPORTED allowances in X city is Y  or Z allowance sounds  high or low.  \n\nA principle from many businesses  - If all or most of the customers are saying yes to the economics then your asking is probably low,  if few are saying yes then you need to  change the product, marketing or financial expectation.",

I can understand some overlap as you look for the right match; but regularly seeing 3+ SBs a week, how do you have any time to maintain those relationships? \n\nIt seems to be a 'I make $X, with that how many hot women can I sleep with regularly' assessment that many here are making, not what I would consider a real SR.\n\nBut who knows, maybe that is just the vocal minority.

No dinners, no gifts, no inclination that this is beyond sex. \n\nNo one is saying every time you meet someone you owe them a gift. But going out to lunch over a coffee date is still something that shows significantly more interest. (Keep in mind, this does not have to be an expensive meal).\n\nBeing treated as something disposable sucks on both ends. But when you are talking about women as strictly as a dollar value, it\u2019s disgusting. You do not want to be treated as an ATM, we don\u2019t want to be treated as an item.\n\nThis is no way an attack towards you personally. However, these are the issues that a lot of these men are refusing to understand.",

It\u2019s an issue of sitting down and spending a whole meal with someone you may not be compatible with.   If you are unlucky enough to be on a M&G with OP you wouldn\u2019t even know what she looks like before the date.  Who wants that?   And, to all the SBs who cry about how much of their time and money they spend prepping for a M&G, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little easier to throw on a T-shirt and put your hair in a pony tail to meet for a coffee at 9:00 AM instead of getting dressed and prepped for a meal somewhere even moderately nice?",

At the same time the SD has the right to reject the SB they don't like regardless of reasons.\n\nOf course the SBs will realize that looking good is more likely going to attract attention from the SD so it's in their best interest to look good. And the SDs have an interest in keeping the SBs they like by being generous.\n\nIf 99% of the brands you bought are fake and you don't like them, do you keep buying them until you find a real one or actually spend some effort filtering out the goods? \n\nIt's the same with SBs, a ton of them are scammers and rinsers. Sure some SD just burn cash to play the idiots but it's not a fun game to play for the rest of us. There are better ways to lose money than getting scammed.\n\nAlso the \"coffee dates\".

Generosity and trust naturally flow once that comfort is built.  Current SB and I each had our rules of engagement at the start.  Rules that would apparently get me thrown away by OP and all the associated cheerleaders.  We each respected those rules, and grew into a real relationship.  Which has endured for 2.5 years now.  Those rules are now long gone, and I am sure the way my SB is compensated now would pass the scrutiny of even the most jaded skeptics here.  \n\nAs I said elsewhere, I am sick of the people who show up here and carry on as if THEY are the authority, and that their\u2019s is the only truth.  I am likely making it worse by posting and delivering the attention that these types seek.\n\nCurrent SB and I had multiple platonic dates to start.  At really great restaurants for dinner and lunches.  She never expected to be paid for those dates.  It was never an issue that even came up.  But she wanted time to understand who I was before even thinking about going further.  Apparently, my obvious enjoyment of just spending time with her, and zero pressure on the intimacy side, made her decide to proceed.  And for her to persevere when her initial allowance requests where well beyond what I was willing to do.  Those were our rules and they worked.",

Maybe she found a legitimate younger good looking SD, maybe she is attracted to handsome \"Silver Fox\" older men or maybe she is attracted to the maturity, confidence, success, generosity, manners, experience, etc more commonly found in an older man.

That's why Id be the better guy than the highest bidder. In a longer SR with someone I like, who likes me, the rules and numbers go out the window.

It's not just the money that influences us but the intimidation that comes along with being with someone who has lived three times as long as you. A lot of these girls are finding their way in the bowl where there are a lot of creeps/splendas/men looking to take advantage of young women. We probably all treat eachother like we're disposable but I worry that even subjecting myself to a lifestyle where me having a bad day could mean the lapse of my support because my SD just wanted someone who would be a fantasy girlfriend. And a lot of SD's defend shitty behavior because they're *good* SD's and don't realize that a lot of these people aren't as good as them. I know there are probably a shit ton of rinsers but I'm sure a lot of SB's requiring gifts at M&G's have been through it with enough assholes that they won't put themselves at risk without the promise of something material or financial. I don't think they should be demonized for that. I know SD's are giving up their money but we're giving up our bodies. Even with someone you really desire, a decent show of good faith and reliability in a relationship where sex is expected on the second date  or you're a rinser would probably go a long way.",

The issue is the amount of times the men on this forum will actively degrade potential sugars on this forum, when really they should just get an escort. ( which there is no shame in doing)\n\nIf you want to pay for sex then do that, but so many times I\u2019ve seen \u201cSD\u2019s\u201d cry about wanting an actual sugar relationship and do nothing but pay an SB for sex. No dinners, no gifts, no inclination that this is beyond sex. \n\nNo one is saying every time you meet someone you owe them a gift. But going out to lunch over a coffee date is still something that shows significantly more interest. (Keep in mind, this does not have to be an expensive meal).\n\nBeing treated as something disposable sucks on both ends. But when you are talking about women as strictly as a dollar value, it\u2019s disgusting. You do not want to be treated as an ATM, we don\u2019t want to be treated as an item.\n\nThis is no way an attack towards you personally.

You\u2019d think they literally need to go to a salon and get their hair and nails done prior to every date and that all of their clothing disappears after being worn once.  \n\nIt certainly would help an SB\u2019s chances of an SD being interested if she shows up looking her best, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s required for a lot of us looking for long term SRs.   My SGF of over a year rolled out of bed, threw her hair in a pony tail and showed up in simple clothes I can\u2019t remember now.  It was a morning coffee date, and I was there to judge whether we had a compatible personality.   I had seen her pictures and knew she could dress up.",

We probably all treat eachother like we're disposable but I worry that even subjecting myself to a lifestyle where me having a bad day could mean the lapse of my support because my SD just wanted someone who would be a fantasy girlfriend. And a lot of SD's defend shitty behavior because they're *good* SD's and don't realize that a lot of these people aren't as good as them. I know there are probably a shit ton of rinsers but I'm sure a lot of SB's requiring gifts at M&G's have been through it with enough assholes that they won't put themselves at risk without the promise of something material or financial. I don't think they should be demonized for that. I know SD's are giving up their money but we're giving up our bodies. Even with someone you really desire, a decent show of good faith and reliability in a relationship where sex is expected on the second date  or you're a rinser would probably go a long way.",

Asking for money before meeting, catfish pics, treating us as an ATM and showing no respect, and asking for things from the Gucci store before the arrangement has started are examples of things we have to deal with. But you think SBs can do no wrong and are always victims. \n\nAre you from TikTok?",

The issue is the amount of times the men on this forum will actively degrade potential sugars on this forum, when really they should just get an escort.

No dinners, no gifts, no inclination that this is beyond sex. \n\nNo one is saying every time you meet someone you owe them a gift. But going out to lunch over a coffee date is still something that shows significantly more interest. (Keep in mind, this does not have to be an expensive meal).\n\nBeing treated as something disposable sucks on both ends. But when you are talking about women as strictly as a dollar value, it\u2019s disgusting. You do not want to be treated as an ATM, we don\u2019t want to be treated as an item.\n\nThis is no way an attack towards you personally.

A lot of these girls are finding their way in the bowl where there are a lot of creeps/splendas/men looking to take advantage of young women. We probably all treat eachother like we're disposable but I worry that even subjecting myself to a lifestyle where me having a bad day could mean the lapse of my support because my SD just wanted someone who would be a fantasy girlfriend. And a lot of SD's defend shitty behavior because they're *good* SD's and don't realize that a lot of these people aren't as good as them. I know there are probably a shit ton of rinsers but I'm sure a lot of SB's requiring gifts at M&G's have been through it with enough assholes that they won't put themselves at risk without the promise of something material or financial. I don't think they should be demonized for that. I know SD's are giving up their money but we're giving up our bodies. Even with someone you really desire, a decent show of good faith and reliability in a relationship where sex is expected on the second date  or you're a rinser would probably go a long way.",
