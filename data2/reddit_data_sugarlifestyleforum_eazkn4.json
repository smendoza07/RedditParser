    "body": "On this sub we routinely talk about having value. Maybe not so amount focused now that discussions of money are off the table, but in reality we still do. Almost every single discussion we have on this forum is about value. \n\nAs an SB (or an SD) joining this lifestyle we are always urged to think about what we can get from the relationship. How much allowance do you want? How many times a week do we want to meet? What type of woman are we looking for? What type of man? What value do we get from the relationship?\n\nHow about we flip that thinking for a moment? \n\nUpon joining this lifestyle I asked myself what *I had to offer*. What *value* would I bring to a relationship with a man?\n\nEveryone has some value. But it\u2019s up to them to realize what that is. Personally? I\u2019m an older girl, who struggles with staying thin. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m routinely working too much and tired all the time. I\u2019m not your normal sugar baby. \n\nSo what value do I add? \n\nWell, I\u2019m passionate. Curious. Loving. I thrive off physical touch, cuddling and bonding experiences. I love to read and write. I also love to talk. Seriously, I\u2019m a talker. I enjoy connections that transcend one night stands. I enjoy the closeness that comes from laying nose to nose with someone while they talk about their day. I like naps. I\u2019m moderately attractive with nice legs and I can bake any cake, cookie, or pie better than most grandmas. Oh, and I love sex. \n\nSo there you have it. *My value.* \n\nBut what does that have to do with anything? \n\nThis lifestyle is hard. It\u2019s hard for men and women alike. We walk into this lifestyle telling ourselves that **X** is what we want, but we don\u2019t stop to ask ourselves *what we offer* and, just as importantly, *to whom*?\n\nBecause, after determining what value I brought to a relationship, I asked myself, who would want it?\n\nDoes an early twenties finance guy, one who parties all night with leggy blondes, want me? \n\nDoes a financially established world traveler want a mom that is tethered to her home town 6 nights a week?\n\nDoes a man looking to hook up on the regular, one with two hours to spare over lunch, want me?\n\nAnd the answer is: *No, of course not.*\n\nJust as important as knowing your value is knowing who you mesh with. Know who is looking for you, too. You cannot fit a round peg into a square hole and you\u2019ll exhaust yourself trying. \n\nWhat does this have to do with anything?\n\nSometimes I look at this lifestyle and wonder where everything went so wrong. We routinely lament on how diluted the pool has become, but then we turn around and jump right back into the water without some introspection. We need some focus. Stop throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. \n\nI\u2019ve had some really great relationships in this lifestyle. I am sometimes asked how I\u2019ve had such success when others have so much trouble. And the answer is, I know my value. \n\nI build lasting relationships by thinking about what I can give and not what I want. Every man I speak with, or meet, I think about what I have to offer. Does it mesh with them? I don\u2019t try to become something I\u2019m not. I take all my insecurity and work-a-holicness, and love for naps, and I lay it on the table in front of them. I look for, and connect with, men that are looking for what I *give*, and I end up with men offering the same in return. Funny how that works. \n\nI encourage everyone to contemplate their value today. What do **you** offer? And, in this diluted pool, to **whom**? \n\nBuild lasting connections.",

This is especially true for younger ones. \n\nIf you\u2019re 21 from a middle class backgroubd, it\u2019s probably hard to fathom just how much money people have. \n\nYou think of $400 as a week of working at StarBucks as opposed to a few hours of collecting dividends off of a low risk stock portfolio. \n\nYou think \u201cthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m worth $900!\u201d, not realizing just how little money that really is to some of these guys.",

Maybe that will have a bit of influence on the margins, but a *lack* of any particular skills really isn't going to move the needle when it comes to most SD's.",

I grew up in a blue collar family, went to university in NYC, and have been very very fortunate in my career. I try to be humble and genuine and enjoy a much more meaningful connection when meeting someone for the first time and they approach it the same way. :-) Ultimately for me, I value chemistry and connection just as much, perhaps maybe more than looks. good luck everyone!",

Hopefully we are evolving, but most certainly some of us are devolving and others are just disintegrating. \n\nFirst of all, to offer anything of value to others, we do need to know who we are. We need to accept what We value in others and in ourselves, and what we are worth not initially in dollars and cents, but in rarity and esteem. \n\nOne of the biggest fallacies in the SB SD relationships and interactions is that people need to talk about money and sex from beginning to end. That is a sign of a. boring conversation and probably boring partner, and b. lack of any interest in anything but exchanging one simple commodity for another. \n\nTo me there an art in this kind of life just like there is an art in any other. \nTo me a sugarbaby is also and primarily a nurturer, a destresser, an erotic firestarter, a friend, a playmate, and someone who can listen and be trusted to keep her SD's frustrations to herself. Sugarbabies are courtesans, nurses, well kept solicitious ladies, epically creative sluts, and many other things. But what a good sugar baby is NOT ....is greedy, needy, shallow and disrespectful to herself or anyone else. \nA good sugardaddy offers more than money too. He offers the security of a hand to steady your ride, the mind of someone who can give you good advice if you dont burden him, a leader who can be inspiring in your own private world. \n\nThe best relationships are always going to be more than transactional. That is why I think its very good point the OP has about assessing our value. Because value isnt stacks of bills. Value is something that we can make ourselves. A poor woman with a strong sense of self who is not afraid to be honest and funny and loving and and cares for her appearance and the happiness of those around her is going to go farther than someone who thinks that walking into a room with the attitude of a brat will get her ahead in the long run. \nCourtesy, lack of desperation, and an ability to be and accept honesty as well as hopefully some well placed smiles and the ephemeral thing called chemistry is what makes the other things come to us. By putting sense before dollars, one can make a lot more sense out of their lives and more cash than if one acts like this is the same thing as an hourly transaction. It is not. The archetype of a sugarbaby is actually the archetype of a consort, of a courtesan, of a non married non taken free woman with the education and humor to divert amuse and entertain men.",

But I seem to have a sweet spot -- a particular set of attributes that some types of SBs eventually value as much or more than allowance, and when I get this match, it has consistently resulted in my long-term, best arrangements.  I realize this mostly because these types of SBs echo back to me what they like about me, so I've been bringing that a bit more front and center",

I think being yourself works best ( i\u2019m pretty free spirited and goofy myself :-) ) Another thing that I have found is that I \u201cmesh\u201d better with ladies from working class families more than ladies that grew up in wealthy ones. So it\u2019s always tough for me to vibe with ladies from Greenwich and Westchester (generalization.. i know) . I grew up in a blue collar family, went to university in NYC, and have been very very fortunate in my career. I try to be humble and genuine and enjoy a much more meaningful connection when meeting someone for the first time and they approach it the same way. :-) Ultimately for me, I value chemistry and connection just as much, perhaps maybe more than looks. good luck everyone!",
