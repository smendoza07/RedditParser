[Episode 174]\n\nI started watching RM when they went to some sort of mock up western town/village or amusement park, episode 63, with SNSD as guests.. back in 2011. For my first time watching LKS made a very strong impression on me in that episode with his weird black singlet dance trying to impress the girls lol.\n\nNever missed a single Monday since then, pretty sad things are slowly beginning to change. Still remember feeling a bit disappointed and pissed during the times when there were Mondays with no new RM episodes because of some other programs haha, good times.\n\nAt least RM is still ongoing - less members or not, I'll still continue to watch it every Monday.",
