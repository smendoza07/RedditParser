Don't think they have any time now. They are soo much busy now.\n\nI just want all of them to comeback for 1 big episode, in the end ,  apink as well as they are the ones with most number of epsidoes featured behind family projects member's I think.",

Here she is helping Jeon So-min when she got cramps in her leg due to attempting to \"foot-pinch\" Se-chan.\n\nI love how Kang Han-na came forward and started massaging her toes.\n\nI miss her. Maybe it's a bit ambitious, but I want to see her return as a guest, even for just one episode. Her chemistry with the RM members was way too good.\n\nAs Haha rightly described her, she is someone who pretends to be normal.\n\nAnother highlight from this episode is when she suddenly started to laugh, for no reason at all. YJS was talking seriously and she started laughing. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nP.S.- I really liked how the graphics team put angel wings on KHN.",
