But it also can be used on other things near him, such as his clothing, obviously. So when eating, he should definitely be able to just shove the food through his mask and allow it to phase through, then eat it without ever having to remove his disguise.\n\nCome to think of it, had Kakashi fully mastered his Kamui ability to the extent Obito did, he could pull the same shit when eating ramen in front of others.",
