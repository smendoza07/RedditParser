    "body": "I just wanted to take a moment to gush over my current SR. \n\nAfter an entire summer of searching, I finally found the perfect SD. He is exactly what I had been looking for and he came at a time when I almost lost all hope. I thought what I was looking for was unrealistic. \n\nHe is the perfect gentleman. He pulls my chair out before I sit down, he makes me coffee in the morning and pays attention to exactly what I like. We talk everyday. When we are together, it feels so natural. Our chemistry is on point. He makes me feel like the most precious thing in the world. \n\nWe have spent two weekends together and now we have plans for a week long vacation. I am in heaven. \n\nI just wanted to thank everyone here because after I found this sub (this is a throwaway account) I learned so much on what I can expect and the do\u2019s and the dont\u2019s of sugar dating. \n\nThank you all again for being so wise and sharing your stories! It really has helped me find exactly what I was looking for!! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\u2728\u2728",

Interesting you felt the need to passively aggressively bring up money and material items, which am sure are part of their arrangement. \n\nFor me, it would be refreshing to see guys post about how happy they are to spoil their girl rotten and not lecture and encourage men to refuse giving gifts or money on \u201cplatonic\u201d dates or before sex. I read about emotional connection a lot from guys online here, and agree that is important, but rarely read about men who enjoy spoiling financially and find pleasure in setting up their lady friend for a secure financial future. The one-sided benefit seems to focus on men\u2019s needs only....Imagine that...men being selfish. \ud83d\ude09",

We're only a couple weeks into the arrangement and I'm sure many SDs on here will question if I'm not being cautious enough but she's been very affectionate and attentive and I get no inkling of her wanting to be spoiled. She does little unprompted thoughtful things here and there for me as well. She's been stressed about a couple exams this week and was trying to fit me into her schedule by rearranging some things on her end. I told her to focus on her exams and that it's no big deal if we can't meet this week. I also sent over our regular PPM. Additionally, she did a little shopping with the first PPM and I covered the cost for that as well.",

I read about emotional connection a lot from guys online here, and agree that is important, but rarely read about men who enjoy spoiling financially and find pleasure in setting up their lady friend for a secure financial future.

We're only a couple weeks into the arrangement and I'm sure many SDs on here will question if I'm not being cautious enough but she's been very affectionate and attentive and I get no inkling of her wanting to be spoiled. She does little unprompted thoughtful things here and there for me as well. She's been stressed about a couple exams this week and was trying to fit me into her schedule by rearranging some things on her end. I told her to focus on her exams and that it's no big deal if we can't meet this week. I also sent over our regular PPM. Additionally, she did a little shopping with the first PPM and I covered the cost for that as well.",

We're only a couple weeks into the arrangement and I'm sure many SDs on here will question if I'm not being cautious enough but she's been very affectionate and attentive and I get no inkling of her wanting to be spoiled. She does little unprompted thoughtful things here and there for me as well. She's been stressed about a couple exams this week and was trying to fit me into her schedule by rearranging some things on her end. I told her to focus on her exams and that it's no big deal if we can't meet this week. I also sent over our regular PPM. Additionally, she did a little shopping with the first PPM and I covered the cost for that as well.",
