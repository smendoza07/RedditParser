This dude is something else and he's the youngest akatsuki member lmao",

If Deidara took a minute to compose himself, he probably would\u2019ve realized Sasuke wanted to kill Itachi and realized the last two Uchiha (not counting Obito) we\u2019re gonna kill themselves and he could just go on to bomb more villages",

Shukaku is the weakest beast, so Gaara probably had the least enhancement of the jinchuriki. He didn\u2019t solo the 3 tails jinchuriki, that\u2019s Yagura, who was beaten by Itachi after him and Juzo were sent to capture the 3 tails. Yagura killed Juzo while Itachi was there before being defeated. He was a perfect jinchuriki, yet he didn\u2019t use his perfect form against Itachi, so he could be closer to Itachi than we thought. I think Yagura is the 3rd strongest jinchuriki after Naruto and Bee and it\u2019s not really close. I don\u2019t think Deidara would ever beat Yagura, except for with C0, but it\u2019s not really a win because Deidara would be dying first. Deidara could beat the 3 tails with a weaker jinchuriki like Yukimaru, but not Yagura, the real 3 tails jinchuriki. This wasn\u2019t meant to say that Deidara is weak, I think he could\u2019ve beat Gaara at that point in the story, but it wouldn\u2019t be as easy of a win if he wasn\u2019t near the village. EOS Gaara could probably beat Deidara.",
