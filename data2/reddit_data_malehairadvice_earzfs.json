That said, your barber has seen a lot of hair and was up close so it's certainly possible he saw more than this pic reveals. You do have a high hairline so that could be another indicator, though it doesn't look it compared to friends I have who usually have thinning along with receding.\n\nAll that said, I think the one on the right looks sharper and fits your face shape better, particularly in the case that your forehead is as large as it is. I'm definitely an advocate of doing what you like best (don't keep a hair style that you hate), but from an outside perspective, I think he made some good choices here.",
