Naruto was an exception because of Minato's skilled sealing but even then Kurama was able to leak out at times. For normal jinchurikis, the beasts would often come out and devastate the village and families which is why they were hated so much in the first place (Iruka hated Naruto at the start because of Kurama killing his parents).\n\nAnd then you throw in nefarious people who can force jinchurikis out. Orochimaru unleashed the 8-tails on the cloud village (and also weakened Naruto's seal to do the same to Konoha) and you also have Sharingans that can force jinchurikis out. That is akin to handing out your nuclear activation codes to the most wanted people in the world. Even with good jinchuriki control, there's no telling what might happen.",

For no reason it's unprecedented and with that you could simply keep a better watch on them. The Kurama attack on the leaf was because of an extraction not a crazed Jinchuriki. The Uchihas until Konoha killed them off never really did that",
