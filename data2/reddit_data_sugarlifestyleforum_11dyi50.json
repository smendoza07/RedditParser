    "body": "Sugar breaks ups are like loosing your partner and loosing your job on the same day. \n\nSD had a change in income and told me today that he needs to step back. He says he\u2019ll see me through March. It\u2019s been a really lovely 2.5 years and I\u2019ve often thought what would I do without him. I guess I\u2019m about to find out. \n\nIn the 2.5 years we\u2019ve been together I\u2019ve never seen this man show a single emotion lol and yet today we both just held each other and cried and cried. It was touching in a way, but doesn\u2019t make this any easier. He\u2019s been such a solid support human. He\u2019s a real diamond. I\u2019m going to miss him.",

She told me \"If you want, we can still see each other until you can sugar again, I would do it just for the pleasure\"(#truth, I still have the texts from it somewhere in GV, since I do not use SC, in a joking nod to another thread). Which I found incredibly sweet, and also incredibly complimentary (by way of explanation, a sensual dominance session can be almost overwhelmingly pleasurable to the subject of it) but I told I had had to decline, as I would feel badly about it. She was not dependent on me, the sugar just gave her many extras as a student who worked as a phlebotomist. Fortunately the other situation was just during chemo, which was successful (but sadly not for always) and I recontacted her after I think 3 months, and we kept up where we had left off.",

Why would you be hurt if the \u201ctransaction \u201c of an SR makes it not a real relationship? Would you stay in an SR where you stopped getting sex would you feel offended if the sb was hurt you stopped providing allowance? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to argue I\u2019m  just trying to understand your perspective since it seems liek one quite a few SDs share. Is it only transactional when the Sb still wants to maintain the financial arrangement or does it count for SDs who withdraw support due to lacking on the sexual side?",

Would you stay in an SR where you stopped getting sex would you feel offended if the sb was hurt you stopped providing allowance? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to argue I\u2019m  just trying to understand your perspective since it seems liek one quite a few SDs share. Is it only transactional when the Sb still wants to maintain the financial arrangement or does it count for SDs who withdraw support due to lacking on the sexual side?",

Would you stay in an SR where you stopped getting sex would you feel offended if the sb was hurt you stopped providing allowance? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to argue I\u2019m  just trying to understand your perspective since it seems liek one quite a few SDs share. Is it only transactional when the Sb still wants to maintain the financial arrangement or does it count for SDs who withdraw support due to lacking on the sexual side?",

Her dad also provided for her mom. It\u2019s not exactly a new or shameful thing .\n\nAgain if that\u2019s how your SRs are then so be it. Sugaring is a great way to ensure you don\u2019t have to deal with bill hagglers and guys who are actually willing to provide \n\nAgain fun all has to do with what kind of person you are, interests, how you are raised etc. I consider my dates fun. If that\u2019s how you sugar date that\u2019s on you. I don\u2019t need the money my parents cover everything, SRs are fun  and hot imo and there\u2019s a level of honesty that\u2019s difficult with vanilla sometimes moz",
