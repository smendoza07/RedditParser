It's hard to put an actual metric on resistance to possession, or to make it look impressive. I can judge the power of a 50-foot person, or the ability to summon a giant meteor the size of a small town, and someone being able to fight against that immediately sets a power level for himself. Meanwhile, I can't judge the ability to resist possession. So it's hard to make a good looking fight, which is kinda key for a shonen.\n\nThe entire fight devolves into \"find a way to catch my opponent with my technique\", and we already have Shikamaru that does that.\n\nOnce she catches her opponent with her technique, either she gets an insta-win, or there's an ass-pull like with the Sakura fight. There's basically no way to balance it for single fights, especially at higher power levels, outside of making it into a glorified flash-bang, like in the fight against Obito.",

Dude has so much character development! I have extremely mixed feelings (more towards the bad) for the Boruto series, but I think Shino is probably the only one with the most personality development out of Konoha 12 in the new era! Why can't Tenten get like a fraction of what Shino is getting??? I don't even like her like that! Justice for Tenten!",

It's hard to put an actual metric on resistance to possession, or to make it look impressive. I can judge the power of a 50-foot person, or the ability to summon a giant meteor the size of a small town, and someone being able to fight against that immediately sets a power level for himself. Meanwhile, I can't judge the ability to resist possession. So it's hard to make a good looking fight, which is kinda key for a shonen.\n\nThe entire fight devolves into \"find a way to catch my opponent with my technique\", and we already have Shikamaru that does that.\n\nOnce she catches her opponent with her technique, either she gets an insta-win, or there's an ass-pull like with the Sakura fight. There's basically no way to balance it for single fights, especially at higher power levels, outside of making it into a glorified flash-bang, like in the fight against Obito.",

It's hard to put an actual metric on resistance to possession, or to make it look impressive. I can judge the power of a 50-foot person, or the ability to summon a giant meteor the size of a small town, and someone being able to fight against that immediately sets a power level for himself. Meanwhile, I can't judge the ability to resist possession. So it's hard to make a good looking fight, which is kinda key for a shonen.\n\nThe entire fight devolves into \"find a way to catch my opponent with my technique\", and we already have Shikamaru that does that.\n\nOnce she catches her opponent with her technique, either she gets an insta-win, or there's an ass-pull like with the Sakura fight. There's basically no way to balance it for single fights, especially at higher power levels, outside of making it into a glorified flash-bang, like in the fight against Obito.",

It's hard to put an actual metric on resistance to possession, or to make it look impressive. I can judge the power of a 50-foot person, or the ability to summon a giant meteor the size of a small town, and someone being able to fight against that immediately sets a power level for himself. Meanwhile, I can't judge the ability to resist possession. So it's hard to make a good looking fight, which is kinda key for a shonen.\n\nThe entire fight devolves into \"find a way to catch my opponent with my technique\", and we already have Shikamaru that does that.\n\nOnce she catches her opponent with her technique, either she gets an insta-win, or there's an ass-pull like with the Sakura fight. There's basically no way to balance it for single fights, especially at higher power levels, outside of making it into a glorified flash-bang, like in the fight against Obito.",
