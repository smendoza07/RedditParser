Then you tell them about the \u201cintimacy\u201d part and they immediately go \u201coh no , i wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d. Mind you they dont put platonic or anything in their profile \ud83d\ude02.

Lots of people think the deadlines, formatting, and rubrics didn't apply to them. Lots of people don't read the fine print.\n\nLots of people think they can drive like maniacs without repercussions, lots of people think they are special and don't need to read the fine print before signing a contract, and lots of people think they can be a nail tech, scientist, hotelier, business owner, etc. without putting in the work and research needed, and are *shocked* I tell you, when they find out anything worth having is worth working for. \n\nPeople are lazy and entitled, and it takes life experience and maturity to figure that out.",

Before that, SBs could list the amount of allowance they wanted on their profile, and they could openly say what they would or wouldn't do sexually wise. Nowadays even mentioning ppm in dms will get you banned.  \nSecond, a lot of SBs (if you can call them that) on the site are openly scamming. There was a post a couple of days ago where one girl was asking if taking the allowance at the M&G and running would get her banned from Seeking - she framed it as 'what if I decide I didn't like him after I took the money' or something like that, but it was a blatant scam. Somehow, about half the responses were supportive.  \nThird, while I don't see it mentioned here, the real top-tier SBs now have way better paying alternatives elsewhere. Search for SBs in Dubai, Istanbul or Singapore. You'll find the quality of girls is much better than the US or UK. Why? Because the allowance is also at least 3x more. The mods are going to ban me if I say the average amount as a number, but it's the price of an entry level car per month.

She was very pretty and charming but then I found her social media pages.  She was seeing me for the average in my area including intimacy. But on her social media she was pretending that she did get intimate and was getting three times the average ppm for a platonic lunch.
