You, reading. Do you think your opinion of an unruly orphan of ~4-7 years would reflect the anger you'd feel toward the fox? Or would those be separate feelings. If they *were* intermingled, are you the kind of person that would wear on your sleeve, or worse yet, direct towards the child? Most reasonable people, I think, would separate the two, and a minority would not have the emotional wherewithal to arrive at that conclusion. I'd argue the story could be more realistic this way round.",

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Kakashi is emotionally distant from everyone same as Sasuke.\n\nThat's a dead ringer for team 7.\n\nThe only way Obito would stop loving Rin is if she hurt him so badly like Sakura did.

Even if Rin survived and Obito came back safely, knowing Kakashi I really do not think that he and Rin would have ever made a couple. Kakashi is not like the Uchiha's. He doesn't intend to have a family, his only purpose is to be a tool and that is how he grew up to become. Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out. He was supposed to end up together with someone and he shown to be interested in Sakura even in season 1, despite the cold act he gave towards her. You can also tell that Kakashi wasn't cold to Rin, he was friendly towards her but didn't really care about her feelings for him. Obito and Rin were also very much closer than Sakura and Naruto. Obito also secretly crushed on Rin wheras Naruto didn't  hide it and made it part of most of their interaction. They are overall very different, be it environment, relationship or attitude towards each other.",

Pretty easy to be an optimistic talk-no-jutsu-machine when you had a relatively fine childhood outside of no biological parents and some sneers here and there about being a fox boy.",

But maybe that\u2019s why Danzo was able to do so much shady shit behind his back, because he went too easy on him and Orochimaru. That being said he did have the longest tenure by far so more bad shit was bound to happen, but even then he managed to stop the Uchiha coup (even though it was messy af and arguably started by Hashirama not finishing off Madara, and Tobirama ostracizing the Uchiha), and Naruto\u2019s situation ultimately turned out good, he speaks quite fondly of Hiruzen to this day. I don\u2019t think he was the worst per se, he just inherited a lot of bullshit.\n\nI actually wouldn\u2019t mind a retcon where they show Hiruzen secretly adopted Naruto until he was like 10 or so and kept it under wraps for security reasons, but Naruto ultimately leaves to live on his own because he still feels isolated due to treatment from the villagers. Also more of an effort on Hiruzen\u2019s part to dispel the animosity they had towards Naruto, to no avail. I think this would deepen their relationship and make more logical sense, being that my boy was a mf weapon of mass destruction. And would explain why Naruto didn\u2019t completely fly off the handle like Gaara.\n\nEdit: Also my man honestly did the best he could when Kurama attacked, and he died defending the village against the Sound/Sand invasion. Him sealing Orochimaru\u2019s arms probably had a lot bigger effect on the story than a lot of people realize- this delayed his plans to take Sasuke\u2019s body, prevented an immediate counter attack on the leaf, and ultimately lead to Orochimaru becoming an ally during the war arc. And Sasuke probably would not have become an ally either without Orochimaru summoning the Hokage.",

Then they get to that point and they\u2019ve kinda written themselves into a corner because it doesn\u2019t make sense that Hiruzen *wouldn\u2019t* promise to take care of Naruto, but they\u2019d already established he was alone and couldn\u2019t really change it. Or they didn\u2019t have time and just left it as is.\n\nIt\u2019s most logical to assume that Hiruzen put him in the orphanage like Kabuto and honestly probably Sasuke went to after his clan get merced, I mean he was only 6 himself. And in Hiruzen\u2019s mind this is safer because he\u2019s trying to hide Naruto\u2019s identity while the village is without an experienced Jinchuuriki for awhile. And yeah he probably checked on him and had some kind of relationship because why wouldn\u2019t he? But I don\u2019t know that just isn\u2019t good enough. I mean this is the single most important military asset in the village, on top of being the 4th\u2019s son. And Hiruzen had to know he was getting ostracized. So why not keep him closer to you?

Well, there was 5 of us\u201d. They were at war, none of that was personal, and if anything tobirama killed Izuna right after... Madara didn\u2019t betray hashirama, he simply felt that he and the rest of the uchiha were being left out of thing related to the village and he wanted more say, but the rest of the uchiha were happy with peace and called him a murderer for taking his brothers eyes and then they ostracized him. So he left the vilage. Black zetzu manipulated him into thinking the infinite tsukuyomi was going to bring peace to the world and thats what he and hashirama ultimately wanted, they just went about it differently.. and the coup was caused because of the measures put in place by tobirama, he wasn\u2019t around for it, but was one of the main factors.. so saying his racism (which I\u2019m not sure he was, he was just extremely cautious of them because he knew what they were capable of.. he even had an uchiha in his team.. but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s people who could defend this better) is justified is wrong, especially with the example you gave",

We as the viewer  know differently but tobirama is justified if you watch the course of events through his eyes. You have to remember that we are watching as not a third party, but a 4th party who is more privy to the on-goings of their universe.",

The Uchiha get a super bad rap because of all the Tobirama fanboys but what people need to realize is we see most of the series through the eyes of the Senju\u2019s allies. The Uchiha were just as wronged by the Senju as the Senju were wronged by the Uchiha. Most Uchiha did not side with Madara as evidenced by their continued service to village after his betrayal.",

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

You underestimate the power of the other villages. Hashirama wasn't the only one who could go toe to toe against tailed beast.\n\n\n\n>There was too much political tension during Hashirama and Tobirama's era for it to have been a good idea on \"keeping balance\". \n\nThere wasn't after the tailed beast were given. In fact the one who started shit was Madara with his idiotic approach of betraying the peace talks.\n\n\n\n>If instead Hashirama had kept the tailed beasts with them as a safety countermeasure until the political tensions could diffuse, and diplomacy could effectively take place, then keeping balance would make sense.\n\nDitto.

Who was the other adult egging the teenagers.\nYou act as if Konoha was any more mature, they weren't. They were as greedy and power hungry as the rest, if not more giving that they had a hand in starting at least two of those world wars.\nKeeling the tailed beast for themselves is a recipe for disaster.",

Also compare Minato's office space to Tsunade's or Naruto's. the latter 2 have mountains of paperwork they are late on getting on with, Minato didn't have a single unfinished paper in the room. He is undoubtedly the most efficient kage.\n\nIt's true the peace is what helped Kakashi nurture Konoha, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he still had to have had a massive political influence when it comes to trade, finance of projects, infrastructure, technological integration, open customs and all that. Take for example a real world setting, even if 2 different parties control the same country at 2 consecutive terms, both at peace, the country tends to develop more under the party that manages it better and has better policies.\n\nThis leads us to belive that Kakashi's overall management of Konoha and its allies was supergenius, and few other people would be able to do as good a job of running what is basically a country as he did",

The amount of negative points assigned and the gravity of their shortcomings is literally a matter of opinion. Why are you pretending this is a good way to rank the hokage? Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

He couldn't relate to Naruto much since Naruto's emotional pain came from being neglected, not having everything you love torn from you (as happened to both Kakashi and Sasuke). If Kakashi could have done, he most certainly would have done to help out Naruto and probably train Sakura to be genjutsu proficient, but circumstances didn't allow for much opportunity.\n\nKakashi did what all good humans do. Focus on the issues that they *can* solve, then move onto the ones that are more difficult to deal with later.\n\n\nwithout Kakashi's focus Sasuke would have left the village like 60 episodes earlier, and he would be a much colder person who wouldn't be able to empathise.\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, Kakashi did focus on helping Naruto to improve. Remember him teaching him to make the rasenshruiken, and the supper he gave for him during the Pain arc and following period.

(Naruto ages 0-11) Kakashi is depressed AF and in no mental state to focus on the wellbeing of an ostracised child \n\n2. (Naruto ages 11-13) Kakashi is still crawling out of his 2 decade depression, and is using all of his emotional/mental capacity to stop Sasuke going rogue and help him reconcile with the Uchiha Massacre (all his efforts went down the drain when Itachi kicked Sasuke to a pulp while Kakashi was on a different mission)\n\n3. Naruto is away with Jiraiya\n\n4. Kakashi gets the opportunity to, and does help out Naruto",

Just look how Americans treated Muslims or anyone who looked like they could be Muslim after 9/11. Many lost their jobs, friends, and lives. And with the Village Elders, leaders, and some Anbu believing it was the Uchiha who were behind the attack, they not gonna take much chances with Naruto or assume it was an outside attack.\n\nAnd if Hiruzen gave Naruto a good upbringing, he wouldn't strive to be accepted by everyone. He wouldn't have talk no jutsu. Pain would've beaten Naruto and sacrificed him instead of realising his error and trusting Naruto. Kakashi then would remain dead, along with 70% of the village. Akatsuki would win at the end. Naruto also wouldn't be able to connect with Gaara and change him, nor with other Jinchuurikis and villains, because this was part of his focal character development.

The council elders are mere advisors, his word is law. He could have easily assigned shinobi to tutor and watch over Naruto as he did for Konohamaru, he just chose not to. \n\n> Identity of Naruto was to be protected. Wouldn't it be odd if people notice Sarutobi giving Naruto special treatment?\n\nThis argument fell apart when it was revealed Minato and Kushina's relationship was completely open. Everyone in the village knew who they were and that Kushina was pregnant, and that the kid who looks like Minato with Kushina's last name was born the night he and his pregnant wife died. They know who the fuck Naruto is lmao, they just didn't care (to be fair I think this is mostly a writing oversight on Kishimoto's part)\n\n> If they found out he was Minato's son Ninjas would come to assassinate him\n\nAnother thing that was used as an excuse but doesn't actually make sense. Hiruzen fought in literally all three Great Ninja Wars and was the Hokage in 2 of them, he would have infinitely more enemies than Minato and yet did anyone ever come after Asuma and Konohamaru? Konohamaru was shown running around the village willy nilly with no protection regularly, hell he almost got his ass beat by Kankuro in the Chunin Exams arc. You really think an assassin couldn't kill the kid just as easily? Yet it never happened because it doesn't happen lol\n\nSasuke is another great example of this. He is confirmed the last Uchiha in the village, the only way for the Sharingan to remain in Konoha. Wouldn't he be the most prime assassination target for other villages possible? Kill him and Konoha loses one of their strongest bloodlines forever, full stop. And yet, no one ever cares or ever comes after him save for Orochimaru but he wanted his body for personal reasons.\n\nAnd again I would wager that any spy could figure out Naruto's identity in like a fucking week if they really cared enough to do so, neither his parentage or Jinchuuriki status are very well kept \"secrets\" \n\nI think we just have to accept the writing in Naruto was never meant to be very deep and a lot of it is poorly planned and thought out, which comes with the territory when the manga author literally just writes it as he goes week by week.",

Madara after losing against Hashirama asked him to kill Tobirama as the only way he'd join the village.. i wouldn't forget that. He made all the legislation and organized everything so the village lasted as long as it did. His goal was for 6 year olds to not be sent off to die (yes i get 12 isn't that much better but look at it this way that's literally 6 more years with better preparations and a squad leader to help them live through combat which really helped, also there was no way to wait until people were adults the ninja world didn't work like that) He isolated the Uchiha yes but he also gave them some form of power in the form as the police force as compensation so they had a better standing in the village.. the coup started cause people swore they saw sharigan eyes on the Kyuubi and people became suspicious of them because of it which lead to more isolation so that one isn't on Tobirama... that one is on Obito",

Instead he chose to do the opposite and go the private route by minimising the amount of people that knew the truth and letting rumours spread that Naruto was the villain responsible for the attack, which led to Naruto getting trashed on by the village. The real heroes of the story are Ichiraku and Iruka. Gaara is a perfect example of what Naruto could have became: a broken monster. Ichiraku was the first to treat Naruto like a human and made sure he was fed. Iruka looked out for Naruto like he was a younger brother because he was the first person to realise Naruto was simply an innocent child and not the Fox.",

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Kakashi is emotionally distant from everyone same as Sasuke.\n\nThat's a dead ringer for team 7.\n\nThe only way Obito would stop loving Rin is if she hurt him so badly like Sakura did.

Even if Rin survived and Obito came back safely, knowing Kakashi I really do not think that he and Rin would have ever made a couple. Kakashi is not like the Uchiha's. He doesn't intend to have a family, his only purpose is to be a tool and that is how he grew up to become. Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out. He was supposed to end up together with someone and he shown to be interested in Sakura even in season 1, despite the cold act he gave towards her. You can also tell that Kakashi wasn't cold to Rin, he was friendly towards her but didn't really care about her feelings for him. Obito and Rin were also very much closer than Sakura and Naruto. Obito also secretly crushed on Rin wheras Naruto didn't  hide it and made it part of most of their interaction. They are overall very different, be it environment, relationship or attitude towards each other.",

Then they get to that point and they\u2019ve kinda written themselves into a corner because it doesn\u2019t make sense that Hiruzen *wouldn\u2019t* promise to take care of Naruto, but they\u2019d already established he was alone and couldn\u2019t really change it. Or they didn\u2019t have time and just left it as is.\n\nIt\u2019s most logical to assume that Hiruzen put him in the orphanage like Kabuto and honestly probably Sasuke went to after his clan get merced, I mean he was only 6 himself. And in Hiruzen\u2019s mind this is safer because he\u2019s trying to hide Naruto\u2019s identity while the village is without an experienced Jinchuuriki for awhile. And yeah he probably checked on him and had some kind of relationship because why wouldn\u2019t he? But I don\u2019t know that just isn\u2019t good enough. I mean this is the single most important military asset in the village, on top of being the 4th\u2019s son. And Hiruzen had to know he was getting ostracized. So why not keep him closer to you?

You\u2019d have to change a lot to make this work, like him not locking up Naruto with the justification of protecting him, letting Tsunade take over instead of immediately taking over himself, etc. Cool theory though.",

The only one you could argue is unreliable is Tobi, but he really had no reason to cover up for Hiruzen/Danzo if that were the case. Even if you could justify everything else, it would make no sense for him to be brought back in the war arc and fight alongside some of the very people he conspired against, not without some exposition at least.",

Well, there was 5 of us\u201d. They were at war, none of that was personal, and if anything tobirama killed Izuna right after... Madara didn\u2019t betray hashirama, he simply felt that he and the rest of the uchiha were being left out of thing related to the village and he wanted more say, but the rest of the uchiha were happy with peace and called him a murderer for taking his brothers eyes and then they ostracized him. So he left the vilage. Black zetzu manipulated him into thinking the infinite tsukuyomi was going to bring peace to the world and thats what he and hashirama ultimately wanted, they just went about it differently.. and the coup was caused because of the measures put in place by tobirama, he wasn\u2019t around for it, but was one of the main factors.. so saying his racism (which I\u2019m not sure he was, he was just extremely cautious of them because he knew what they were capable of.. he even had an uchiha in his team.. but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s people who could defend this better) is justified is wrong, especially with the example you gave",

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

He could have negotiated to find them Jinchuriki's that they would bond with (like Bee did with the 8 tails). If he was an evil bastard he could've sealed them all into a wooden construct or let Madara take care of them.\n\n\nPoint being there were at least 2 good options and at least 3 bad ones, and he chose something very near to the bottom of those choices.",

You underestimate the power of the other villages. Hashirama wasn't the only one who could go toe to toe against tailed beast.\n\n\n\n>There was too much political tension during Hashirama and Tobirama's era for it to have been a good idea on \"keeping balance\". \n\nThere wasn't after the tailed beast were given. In fact the one who started shit was Madara with his idiotic approach of betraying the peace talks.\n\n\n\n>If instead Hashirama had kept the tailed beasts with them as a safety countermeasure until the political tensions could diffuse, and diplomacy could effectively take place, then keeping balance would make sense.\n\nDitto. The tensions were already aliviated.\n\n>The minute Hasirama died the world erupted into war, because the adult was gone\n\nIt happened... Because of Madara. Who was the other adult egging the teenagers.\nYou act as if Konoha was any more mature, they weren't. They were as greedy and power hungry as the rest, if not more giving that they had a hand in starting at least two of those world wars.\nKeeling the tailed beast for themselves is a recipe for disaster.",

Also compare Minato's office space to Tsunade's or Naruto's. the latter 2 have mountains of paperwork they are late on getting on with, Minato didn't have a single unfinished paper in the room. He is undoubtedly the most efficient kage.\n\nIt's true the peace is what helped Kakashi nurture Konoha, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he still had to have had a massive political influence when it comes to trade, finance of projects, infrastructure, technological integration, open customs and all that. Take for example a real world setting, even if 2 different parties control the same country at 2 consecutive terms, both at peace, the country tends to develop more under the party that manages it better and has better policies.\n\nThis leads us to belive that Kakashi's overall management of Konoha and its allies was supergenius, and few other people would be able to do as good a job of running what is basically a country as he did",

Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

He did the best he could, but his capability at that time was to help the one who needed it the most, not in terms of jutsu and power but the one who was in greatest emotional turmoil\n\nKakashi related to Sasuke the most out of his students, because he went through much of the same pain that Sasuke did, so he wanted to be there to help Sasuke out of it. He couldn't relate to Naruto much since Naruto's emotional pain came from being neglected, not having everything you love torn from you (as happened to both Kakashi and Sasuke). If Kakashi could have done, he most certainly would have done to help out Naruto and probably train Sakura to be genjutsu proficient, but circumstances didn't allow for much opportunity.\n\nKakashi did what all good humans do. Focus on the issues that they *can* solve, then move onto the ones that are more difficult to deal with later.\n\n\nwithout Kakashi's focus Sasuke would have left the village like 60 episodes earlier, and he would be a much colder person who wouldn't be able to empathise.\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, Kakashi did focus on helping Naruto to improve. Remember him teaching him to make the rasenshruiken, and the supper he gave for him during the Pain arc and following period.

That's 18/19 years\n\nHe had so much of his own shit to get through why would you expect him to add another thing onto his plate. Also he was in the Anbu for over a decade too, not much time to be all chumy with the jinchuriki kid when he has 1900 missions to complete (which I belive was his mission count from since he was genin to the time he got to train team 7)",

Its quite similar how assassins were sent after Kushina for being an Uzumaki. \n\nAnd the village was devasted by the attack, no one is gonna act calmly and logically. Just look how Americans treated Muslims or anyone who looked like they could be Muslim after 9/11. Many lost their jobs, friends, and lives. And with the Village Elders, leaders, and some Anbu believing it was the Uchiha who were behind the attack, they not gonna take much chances with Naruto or assume it was an outside attack.\n\nAnd if Hiruzen gave Naruto a good upbringing, he wouldn't strive to be accepted by everyone. He wouldn't have talk no jutsu. Pain would've beaten Naruto and sacrificed him instead of realising his error and trusting Naruto. Kakashi then would remain dead, along with 70% of the village. Akatsuki would win at the end. Naruto also wouldn't be able to connect with Gaara and change him, nor with other Jinchuurikis and villains, because this was part of his focal character development. The series would be completely different too",

The council elders are mere advisors, his word is law. He could have easily assigned shinobi to tutor and watch over Naruto as he did for Konohamaru, he just chose not to. \n\n> Identity of Naruto was to be protected. Wouldn't it be odd if people notice Sarutobi giving Naruto special treatment?\n\nThis argument fell apart when it was revealed Minato and Kushina's relationship was completely open. Everyone in the village knew who they were and that Kushina was pregnant, and that the kid who looks like Minato with Kushina's last name was born the night he and his pregnant wife died. They know who the fuck Naruto is lmao, they just didn't care (to be fair I think this is mostly a writing oversight on Kishimoto's part)\n\n> If they found out he was Minato's son Ninjas would come to assassinate him\n\nAnother thing that was used as an excuse but doesn't actually make sense. Hiruzen fought in literally all three Great Ninja Wars and was the Hokage in 2 of them, he would have infinitely more enemies than Minato and yet did anyone ever come after Asuma and Konohamaru? Konohamaru was shown running around the village willy nilly with no protection regularly, hell he almost got his ass beat by Kankuro in the Chunin Exams arc. You really think an assassin couldn't kill the kid just as easily? Yet it never happened because it doesn't happen lol\n\nSasuke is another great example of this. He is confirmed the last Uchiha in the village, the only way for the Sharingan to remain in Konoha. Wouldn't he be the most prime assassination target for other villages possible? Kill him and Konoha loses one of their strongest bloodlines forever, full stop. And yet, no one ever cares or ever comes after him save for Orochimaru but he wanted his body for personal reasons.\n\nAnd again I would wager that any spy could figure out Naruto's identity in like a fucking week if they really cared enough to do so, neither his parentage or Jinchuuriki status are very well kept \"secrets\" \n\nI think we just have to accept the writing in Naruto was never meant to be very deep and a lot of it is poorly planned and thought out, which comes with the territory when the manga author literally just writes it as he goes week by week.",

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Even if Rin survived and Obito came back safely, knowing Kakashi I really do not think that he and Rin would have ever made a couple. Kakashi is not like the Uchiha's. He doesn't intend to have a family, his only purpose is to be a tool and that is how he grew up to become. Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out. He was supposed to end up together with someone and he shown to be interested in Sakura even in season 1, despite the cold act he gave towards her. You can also tell that Kakashi wasn't cold to Rin, he was friendly towards her but didn't really care about her feelings for him. Obito and Rin were also very much closer than Sakura and Naruto. Obito also secretly crushed on Rin wheras Naruto didn't  hide it and made it part of most of their interaction. They are overall very different, be it environment, relationship or attitude towards each other.",

Then they get to that point and they\u2019ve kinda written themselves into a corner because it doesn\u2019t make sense that Hiruzen *wouldn\u2019t* promise to take care of Naruto, but they\u2019d already established he was alone and couldn\u2019t really change it. Or they didn\u2019t have time and just left it as is.\n\nIt\u2019s most logical to assume that Hiruzen put him in the orphanage like Kabuto and honestly probably Sasuke went to after his clan get merced, I mean he was only 6 himself. And in Hiruzen\u2019s mind this is safer because he\u2019s trying to hide Naruto\u2019s identity while the village is without an experienced Jinchuuriki for awhile. And yeah he probably checked on him and had some kind of relationship because why wouldn\u2019t he? But I don\u2019t know that just isn\u2019t good enough. I mean this is the single most important military asset in the village, on top of being the 4th\u2019s son. And Hiruzen had to know he was getting ostracized. So why not keep him closer to you? Just doesn\u2019t add up. They should have given them more of a relationship.",

Realistically though they couldn\u2019t have been more different, and \u201cDanzo\u201d wouldn\u2019t really have much motive to be as a peaceful leader for as long as Hiruzen was considering the power he had. You\u2019d have to change a lot to make this work, like him not locking up Naruto with the justification of protecting him, letting Tsunade take over instead of immediately taking over himself, etc. Cool theory though.",

Some of those flashbacks are from characters who\u2019d have no reason to lie in those particular situations and experienced them first hand, like Itachi and Shisui, and others are inner monologues Danzo has with himself. The only one you could argue is unreliable is Tobi, but he really had no reason to cover up for Hiruzen/Danzo if that were the case. Even if you could justify everything else, it would make no sense for him to be brought back in the war arc and fight alongside some of the very people he conspired against, not without some exposition at least.",

Well, there was 5 of us\u201d. They were at war, none of that was personal, and if anything tobirama killed Izuna right after... Madara didn\u2019t betray hashirama, he simply felt that he and the rest of the uchiha were being left out of thing related to the village and he wanted more say, but the rest of the uchiha were happy with peace and called him a murderer for taking his brothers eyes and then they ostracized him. So he left the vilage. Black zetzu manipulated him into thinking the infinite tsukuyomi was going to bring peace to the world and thats what he and hashirama ultimately wanted, they just went about it differently.. and the coup was caused because of the measures put in place by tobirama, he wasn\u2019t around for it, but was one of the main factors.. so saying his racism (which I\u2019m not sure he was, he was just extremely cautious of them because he knew what they were capable of.. he even had an uchiha in his team.. but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s people who could defend this better) is justified is wrong, especially with the example you gave",

It may even add ot my point. \n\nYes they were at war, which is a totally justified reason to hate them. They are ninjas, there is never peace between clans. Why should he view them as anything but still the enemy. Words are weak.\n\nAs for black zetsu, tobirama never knew about that so it doesn't effect his justification.  We as the viewer  know differently but tobirama is justified if you watch the course of events through his eyes. You have to remember that we are watching as not a third party, but a 4th party who is more privy to the on-goings of their universe.",

The Uchiha get a super bad rap because of all the Tobirama fanboys but what people need to realize is we see most of the series through the eyes of the Senju\u2019s allies. The Uchiha were just as wronged by the Senju as the Senju were wronged by the Uchiha. Most Uchiha did not side with Madara as evidenced by their continued service to village after his betrayal.",

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

He could have negotiated to find them Jinchuriki's that they would bond with (like Bee did with the 8 tails). If he was an evil bastard he could've sealed them all into a wooden construct or let Madara take care of them.\n\n\nPoint being there were at least 2 good options and at least 3 bad ones, and he chose something very near to the bottom of those choices.",

You underestimate the power of the other villages.

Who was the other adult egging the teenagers.\nYou act as if Konoha was any more mature, they weren't.

Also compare Minato's office space to Tsunade's or Naruto's. the latter 2 have mountains of paperwork they are late on getting on with, Minato didn't have a single unfinished paper in the room. He is undoubtedly the most efficient kage.\n\nIt's true the peace is what helped Kakashi nurture Konoha, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he still had to have had a massive political influence when it comes to trade, finance of projects, infrastructure, technological integration, open customs and all that. Take for example a real world setting, even if 2 different parties control the same country at 2 consecutive terms, both at peace, the country tends to develop more under the party that manages it better and has better policies.\n\nThis leads us to belive that Kakashi's overall management of Konoha and its allies was supergenius, and few other people would be able to do as good a job of running what is basically a country as he did",

The amount of negative points assigned and the gravity of their shortcomings is literally a matter of opinion. Why are you pretending this is a good way to rank the hokage? Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

He did the best he could, but his capability at that time was to help the one who needed it the most, not in terms of jutsu and power but the one who was in greatest emotional turmoil\n\nKakashi related to Sasuke the most out of his students, because he went through much of the same pain that Sasuke did, so he wanted to be there to help Sasuke out of it. He couldn't relate to Naruto much since Naruto's emotional pain came from being neglected, not having everything you love torn from you (as happened to both Kakashi and Sasuke). If Kakashi could have done, he most certainly would have done to help out Naruto and probably train Sakura to be genjutsu proficient, but circumstances didn't allow for much opportunity.\n\nKakashi did what all good humans do. Focus on the issues that they *can* solve, then move onto the ones that are more difficult to deal with later.\n\n\nwithout Kakashi's focus Sasuke would have left the village like 60 episodes earlier, and he would be a much colder person who wouldn't be able to empathise.\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, Kakashi did focus on helping Naruto to improve. Remember him teaching him to make the rasenshruiken, and the supper he gave for him during the Pain arc and following period. He even cast aside some of his dignity to help Naruto talk to the raikage.",

Its quite similar how assassins were sent after Kushina for being an Uzumaki. \n\nAnd the village was devasted by the attack, no one is gonna act calmly and logically. Just look how Americans treated Muslims or anyone who looked like they could be Muslim after 9/11. Many lost their jobs, friends, and lives. And with the Village Elders, leaders, and some Anbu believing it was the Uchiha who were behind the attack, they not gonna take much chances with Naruto or assume it was an outside attack.\n\nAnd if Hiruzen gave Naruto a good upbringing, he wouldn't strive to be accepted by everyone. He wouldn't have talk no jutsu. Pain would've beaten Naruto and sacrificed him instead of realising his error and trusting Naruto. Kakashi then would remain dead, along with 70% of the village. Akatsuki would win at the end. Naruto also wouldn't be able to connect with Gaara and change him, nor with other Jinchuurikis and villains, because this was part of his focal character development. The series would be completely different too",

Most reasonable people, I think, would separate the two, and a minority would not have the emotional wherewithal to arrive at that conclusion.

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic. That is something Kishimoto hinted many times already, I don't see why people try to make it real when even he made sure to let fans know that what Naruto felt for Sakura wasn't that deep.",

Well, there was 5 of us\u201d. They were at war, none of that was personal, and if anything tobirama killed Izuna right after... Madara didn\u2019t betray hashirama, he simply felt that he and the rest of the uchiha were being left out of thing related to the village and he wanted more say, but the rest of the uchiha were happy with peace and called him a murderer for taking his brothers eyes and then they ostracized him. So he left the vilage. Black zetzu manipulated him into thinking the infinite tsukuyomi was going to bring peace to the world and thats what he and hashirama ultimately wanted, they just went about it differently.. and the coup was caused because of the measures put in place by tobirama, he wasn\u2019t around for it, but was one of the main factors.. so saying his racism (which I\u2019m not sure he was, he was just extremely cautious of them because he knew what they were capable of.. he even had an uchiha in his team.. but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s people who could defend this better) is justified is wrong, especially with the example you gave",

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

Also compare Minato's office space to Tsunade's or Naruto's. the latter 2 have mountains of paperwork they are late on getting on with, Minato didn't have a single unfinished paper in the room. He is undoubtedly the most efficient kage.\n\nIt's true the peace is what helped Kakashi nurture Konoha, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he still had to have had a massive political influence when it comes to trade, finance of projects, infrastructure, technological integration, open customs and all that. Take for example a real world setting, even if 2 different parties control the same country at 2 consecutive terms, both at peace, the country tends to develop more under the party that manages it better and has better policies.\n\nThis leads us to belive that Kakashi's overall management of Konoha and its allies was supergenius, and few other people would be able to do as good a job of running what is basically a country as he did",

Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

He couldn't relate to Naruto much since Naruto's emotional pain came from being neglected, not having everything you love torn from you (as happened to both Kakashi and Sasuke). If Kakashi could have done, he most certainly would have done to help out Naruto and probably train Sakura to be genjutsu proficient, but circumstances didn't allow for much opportunity.\n\nKakashi did what all good humans do. Focus on the issues that they *can* solve, then move onto the ones that are more difficult to deal with later.\n\n\nwithout Kakashi's focus Sasuke would have left the village like 60 episodes earlier, and he would be a much colder person who wouldn't be able to empathise.\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, Kakashi did focus on helping Naruto to improve.

That's sure to work out great.\n\nAgain, handing out basic subsistence and offering next to nothing else from the guy with a massive amount of power and influence in the country.\n\nI'm sure that monthly pittance was quite willing to befriend Naruto, sure. That's some support network.\n\nI'm saying he dropped the ball completely on this, much like he was shown to multiple times in the series. It's not egregious to point out the flaws and failings of a character.",

If they *were* intermingled, are you the kind of person that would wear on your sleeve, or worse yet, direct towards the child? Most reasonable people, I think, would separate the two, and a minority would not have the emotional wherewithal to arrive at that conclusion.

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out.

Some of those flashbacks are from characters who\u2019d have no reason to lie in those particular situations and experienced them first hand, like Itachi and Shisui, and others are inner monologues Danzo has with himself. The only one you could argue is unreliable is Tobi, but he really had no reason to cover up for Hiruzen/Danzo if that were the case.

Madara didn\u2019t betray hashirama, he simply felt that he and the rest of the uchiha were being left out of thing related to the village and he wanted more say, but the rest of the uchiha were happy with peace and called him a murderer for taking his brothers eyes and then they ostracized him. So he left the vilage. Black zetzu manipulated him into thinking the infinite tsukuyomi was going to bring peace to the world and thats what he and hashirama ultimately wanted, they just went about it differently.. and the coup was caused because of the measures put in place by tobirama, he wasn\u2019t around for it, but was one of the main factors.. so saying his racism (which I\u2019m not sure he was, he was just extremely cautious of them because he knew what they were capable of.. he even had an uchiha in his team.. but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s people who could defend this better) is justified is wrong, especially with the example you gave",

Why should he view them as anything but still the enemy. Words are weak.\n\nAs for black zetsu, tobirama never knew about that so it doesn't effect his justification.  We as the viewer  know differently but tobirama is justified if you watch the course of events through his eyes. You have to remember that we are watching as not a third party, but a 4th party who is more privy to the on-goings of their universe.",

The Uchiha get a super bad rap because of all the Tobirama fanboys but what people need to realize is we see most of the series through the eyes of the Senju\u2019s allies. The Uchiha were just as wronged by the Senju as the Senju were wronged by the Uchiha. Most Uchiha did not side with Madara as evidenced by their continued service to village after his betrayal.",

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

The amount of negative points assigned and the gravity of their shortcomings is literally a matter of opinion. Why are you pretending this is a good way to rank the hokage? Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

                                            "body": ">Judge it on what you can see. We see Hiruzen and Tobirama make a lot of mistakes so we judge them for it. We don't see Kakashi or Naruto make any mistakes so we judge them accordingly.\n\nThis is really tangential to what I was talking about and you\u2019re addressing an auxiliary point that I made about what we can\u2019t see. However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

If they *were* intermingled, are you the kind of person that would wear on your sleeve, or worse yet, direct towards the child? Most reasonable people, I think, would separate the two, and a minority would not have the emotional wherewithal to arrive at that conclusion.

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Hinata is basically the first and only classmate who actually showed that she cared about him and didn't make fun of him, be it by giving him some ointment.",

Kakashi tried keeping all of them at a distance but Obito saying he thought his dad was a hero struck Kakashi.\n\nSo Naruto loved all of them but was attracted to Sakura as well. Whenever she'd hold onto him like after he saved her on their mission with Jiraiya, he'd get excited and then she'd hit him.\n\nMost importantly Naruto said he loved the smile Sakura had when looking at Sasuke.

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out. He was supposed to end up together with someone and he shown to be interested in Sakura even in season 1, despite the cold act he gave towards her. You can also tell that Kakashi wasn't cold to Rin, he was friendly towards her but didn't really care about her feelings for him. Obito and Rin were also very much closer than Sakura and Naruto. Obito also secretly crushed on Rin wheras Naruto didn't  hide it and made it part of most of their interaction.

No, tobirama did not force the uchihas into a ghetto on the outskirts of konoha. That was danzo/elders.\n\nitachi had no problem joining the anbu, which is separate from the police force\n\nlet me use the game of thrones as an example: you would never call tywin lannister racist against the starks for trying to kill them or not including them in the small council\n\nfamily vs family, or clan vs clan is not racist like you throw around\n\nthe uchihas, and senjus are all from the same land, and **THEY ARE LITERALLY RELATED BY BLOOD**",

Well, there was 5 of us\u201d. They were at war, none of that was personal, and if anything tobirama killed Izuna right after... Madara didn\u2019t betray hashirama, he simply felt that he and the rest of the uchiha were being left out of thing related to the village and he wanted more say, but the rest of the uchiha were happy with peace and called him a murderer for taking his brothers eyes and then they ostracized him. So he left the vilage. Black zetzu manipulated him into thinking the infinite tsukuyomi was going to bring peace to the world and thats what he and hashirama ultimately wanted, they just went about it differently.. and the coup was caused because of the measures put in place by tobirama, he wasn\u2019t around for it, but was one of the main factors.. so saying his racism (which I\u2019m not sure he was, he was just extremely cautious of them because he knew what they were capable of.. he even had an uchiha in his team.. but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s people who could defend this better) is justified is wrong, especially with the example you gave",

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

He could have negotiated to find them Jinchuriki's that they would bond with (like Bee did with the 8 tails). If he was an evil bastard he could've sealed them all into a wooden construct or let Madara take care of them.\n\n\nPoint being there were at least 2 good options and at least 3 bad ones, and he chose something very near to the bottom of those choices.",

The tensions were already aliviated.\n\n>The minute Hasirama died the world erupted into war, because the adult was gone\n\nIt happened... Because of Madara. Who was the other adult egging the teenagers.\nYou act as if Konoha was any more mature, they weren't.

The amount of negative points assigned and the gravity of their shortcomings is literally a matter of opinion. Why are you pretending this is a good way to rank the hokage? Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

We don't see Kakashi or Naruto make any mistakes so we judge them accordingly.\n\nThis is really tangential to what I was talking about and you\u2019re addressing an auxiliary point that I made about what we can\u2019t see. However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

That's 18/19 years\n\nHe had so much of his own shit to get through why would you expect him to add another thing onto his plate. Also he was in the Anbu for over a decade too, not much time to be all chumy with the jinchuriki kid when he has 1900 missions to complete (which I belive was his mission count from since he was genin to the time he got to train team 7)",

Maybe they thought he was an incarnation of kurama, or that somehow Naruto would be influenced by its evil. And in a sense he was (but only when he gets angry for righteous reasons tho). And if that's the case they probably were scared the fox would attack again.\n\nAnd don't forget kurama f*ked sh*t up at the village and killed a ton of ninjas + the 4th. People who lost relatives would still be pissed 12 years later.\n\nAnd Naruto couldn't even get points for being Minato's son, cause Minato killed a sh*t ton of people in the wars, so he would be a target.\n\nAnd I know it's a meme that the third was a d*ck, but in some panels in the manga (during Hiruzen vs orochimaru I think) there were some panels where Hiruzen is holding baby Naruto, which could imply he took care of him while he was a baby. So that Naruto could live on his own when he was (only literally) able to. So the in a sense  the third *did* help Naruto by \"raising\" him and supporting him with an apartment/money.\n\nAnd could it be argued that hiruzens treatment of Naruto helped him in the long run? Might as well face the harsh reality early on instead of trying to escape it, I know it's f*cked up obviously but being on his own and being a pariah caused Naruto to know who his real friends were (iruka and ramen guy), find more friends (everyone in the end), appreciate the value of friendship (why he chased after Sasuke), and gave him the drive to go from being from a talentless nobody, to hokage, cuz he yearned for the recognition.??",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

The amount of negative points assigned and the gravity of their shortcomings is literally a matter of opinion. Why are you pretending this is a good way to rank the hokage? Like everyone else including myself, this is just your opinion.\n\n>If you follow this system, only Naruto, Kakashi and Minato would have 0 negative points\n\nAbsolutely wrong. Minato didn\u2019t realize that the masked man was Obito and not Madara despite being his former teacher. That is a critical failure on his part and **he admits to it** later on when he slashes him on top of the Juubi. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that we know next to nothing about the rest of minato and Kakashi\u2019s respective reigns meaning they could have done mistakes we simply haven\u2019t heard of.\n\n>and as for positive points, Kakashi accrues the most, Tobirama follows (but has enough negative points to put him below Naruto), Minato next, followed by Hashirama (same case as his brother), Naruto, Tsunade then Hiruzen (who has like 1 positive and a whole village full of negative).\n\nAs I said, this is completely arbitrary and nonsensical. The number of positive points you assign for an action, policy or decision could vary wildly. For example, you could give Tsunade a lot of points for having faith in Naruto and her gamble having a very high net positive outcome. On the other hand, you could debate whether or not such risks were worth taking in the first place and assign her less \u201cpoints\u201d, perhaps even none or negative points. Similarly, the amount of negative \u201cpoints\u201d you could assign Tobirama for the Uchiha massacre could range from zero to a lot depending on how far you stretch the blame and accountability for that tragedy.\n\n>But no matter how you look at it, Kakashi did the best as Hokage and Hiruzen did the worst\n\nThis is literally unfounded, we know extremely little about what Kakashi accomplished as hokage. You **chose** to associate the technological developments in the leaf and the relative stability and peace in the village to him when nothing in canon indicates this. In fact, one could very strongly argue for Tsunade and Naruto being the ones who paved the way to peace and all Kakashi had to do was just follow it.",

We don't see Kakashi or Naruto make any mistakes so we judge them accordingly.\n\nThis is really tangential to what I was talking about and you\u2019re addressing an auxiliary point that I made about what we can\u2019t see. However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

Imagine if they ever dated for a period they would immediately break up knowing that their affection to each other was nothing more than platonic.

Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out. He was supposed to end up together with someone and he shown to be interested in Sakura even in season 1, despite the cold act he gave towards her. You can also tell that Kakashi wasn't cold to Rin, he was friendly towards her but didn't really care about her feelings for him. Obito and Rin were also very much closer than Sakura and Naruto.

No, tobirama did not force the uchihas into a ghetto on the outskirts of konoha.

Instead he gave the nukes out to everyone, but unlike our world, there is no such thing as MAD, so it led to a power struggle that would never has happened if Konoha was established as top dog. This would've also meant that more people would move to Konoha to live a peaceful life and the hidden leaf would've been the spearhead if development that could have ushered in peace wayyy before the 4th great war\n\n\nThe only danger would be Madara himself going Rogue and dominating all 9 tailed beasts to start a dictatorship, but that would be extremely out of character for him at the time. We know that a large part of why he went Rogue is because he was dissatisfied with Hashirama's decisions and believed (correctly may I add) that Hashi's decisions would only bring danger to Konoha and the Shinobi world. Madara was right, 3 world wars happened, 2 of which could be traced directly to Hashirama's choices.",

We don't see Kakashi or Naruto make any mistakes so we judge them accordingly.\n\nThis is really tangential to what I was talking about and you\u2019re addressing an auxiliary point that I made about what we can\u2019t see. However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

He couldn't relate to Naruto much since Naruto's emotional pain came from being neglected, not having everything you love torn from you (as happened to both Kakashi and Sasuke). If Kakashi could have done, he most certainly would have done to help out Naruto and probably train Sakura to be genjutsu proficient, but circumstances didn't allow for much opportunity.\n\nKakashi did what all good humans do. Focus on the issues that they *can* solve, then move onto the ones that are more difficult to deal with later.\n\n\nwithout Kakashi's focus Sasuke would have left the village like 60 episodes earlier, and he would be a much colder person who wouldn't be able to empathise.\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, Kakashi did focus on helping Naruto to improve.

That's some support network.\n\nI'm saying he dropped the ball completely on this, much like he was shown to multiple times in the series. It's not egregious to point out the flaws and failings of a character.",

Sasuke in the other hand was all about revenge and intended to have a family to not let the Uchiha clan die out.

We don't see Kakashi or Naruto make any mistakes so we judge them accordingly.\n\nThis is really tangential to what I was talking about and you\u2019re addressing an auxiliary point that I made about what we can\u2019t see. However, the fact of the matter is that Minato is still at a relatively small net positive compared to the rest of the hokage (curbing the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage).\n\n>As for Minato's \"mistake\" that's a very far fetch. Minato felt guilty about something that was totally not in his power. Imagine his situation.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, really. If Minato himself admits it\u2019s a mistake and regrets it, then we have no reason to contradict him. I\u2019m not saying this is huge or anything, but it\u2019s a shortcoming nonetheless.\n\n>Your wife just gave birth to your firstborn, a massive demon fox is wrecking your village, and a masked man who can phase in and out of dimensions is making your day considerably worse.\n\nTsunade and Hashirama were in similarly dire situations and also did their best to save the village. Hashirama by eliminating the man who posed the biggest threat to the village, i.e Madara and Tsunade by shielding and saving the vast majority of Konoha\u2019s population from Pain\u2019s Shinra Tensei. If your argument relies on doing what is within your knowledge and capacity (as evidenced by defending Minato\u2019s admittedly minor failure), then you have quite literally no reason not to assign the same if not greater positive points to Hashirama and Tsunade for what they accomplished.\n\n>He is fighting a mysterious dude with a Mangekyou Sharingan, a complete emo who is a massively proficient fighter and can teleport and phase himself, and is also hellbent on destroying the village.\nYou may as well say Minato made a mistake for not being born with a Byakugan.\n\nLike I said before, Minato admitted wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t matter how minor it is, it\u2019s still an example of a megative point for Obito. Don\u2019t read too much into this, it\u2019s literally just a counter-example for you stating Minato had no flaws or mistakes.\n\n>And yes the list is my opinion, but even if you go by hard facts and logic, nobody on that list is moving 2 places up or 2 places down.\n\nI very much disagree, Kakashi and Minato would be near the bottom along with Hiruzen if you measure their accomplishments based on effort and circumstances (support from key characters, other kage, situation upon taking over, power and ability limitations, etc.).\n\nNaruto, Tsunade, Tobirama and Hashirama are seen or explicitly stated in canon to have had very major impact on the village\u2019s development both before and during their reign and sometimes after. Hashirama and Naruto both ushered in incremental degrees of peace and stability and had lasting impact and in the 1st\u2019s case a fundamental philosophy (the Will of Fire). Hashirama also dealt with Madara and stalled him for dozens of years since he didn\u2019t realize he had failed to permanently eliminate him. Tobirama, on the other hand, created tons of systems and village infrastructure that were of huge benefit to future generations such that even other villages sought to copy what he created. He did very distantly play a part in the Uchiha massacre and so gets significant blame for this, but he wasn\u2019t involved enough for it to overshadow his positives. And last but definitely not least we have Tsunade who took over a completely broken and nearly powerless village after 20 years of wandering around with a broken soul and mind and worked hard to mend the village and its relationship with the Sand. She healed Kakashi and Sasuke after their encounter with Itachi, both of whom later became essential and key players. She protected the entire leaf from Pain\u2019s attack to the point that she went into a very long coma. She led the 5 kage to delay Madara for nearly 2 days and is the only reason the fight lasted as long as it did, therefore buying enough time for the other shinobi fighting Obtio to analyze his abilities and counter them. She healed hundreds of shinobi during the war. Later, despite being retired, she worked with Kakashi to clean up the rest of Danzo\u2019s mess. And on top of all of that, before even becoming hokage, she literally created and revolutionized the medical ninja system and developed countless medical ninjutsu, indirectly and directly saving thousands of lives.\n\nHer only real decision that resulted in a negative outcome was objecting to sending a Jonin, specifically Kakashi, to retrieve Sasuke. But even that is justified in canon by the fact that they were shortstaffed and couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate so many resources to save a single genin.",

(Naruto ages 0-11) Kakashi is depressed AF and in no mental state to focus on the wellbeing of an ostracised child \n\n2. (Naruto ages 11-13) Kakashi is still crawling out of his 2 decade depression, and is using all of his emotional/mental capacity to stop Sasuke going rogue and help him reconcile with the Uchiha Massacre (all his efforts went down the drain when Itachi kicked Sasuke to a pulp while Kakashi was on a different mission)\n\n3. Naruto is away with Jiraiya\n\n4. Kakashi gets the opportunity to, and does help out Naruto",

I mean, everyone that really knew Hiruzen besides their teammates (who could easily be in on it) was gone from the village. Orochimaru was allowed to flee, Jiraiya was busy and never really recalled, Tsunade was allowed to travel... Most of the ppl who could call out Hiruzen/Danzo was gone. \n\nIt's sketchy lol",

No, tobirama did not force the uchihas into a ghetto on the outskirts of konoha. That was danzo/elders.\n\nitachi had no problem joining the anbu, which is separate from the police force\n\nlet me use the game of thrones as an example: you would never call tywin lannister racist against the starks for trying to kill them or not including them in the small council\n\nfamily vs family, or clan vs clan is not racist like you throw around\n\nthe uchihas, and senjus are all from the same land, and **THEY ARE LITERALLY RELATED BY BLOOD**",

If Hiruzen, or both, are the deep fake there's still no reason to let ppl know you cheated as all that does is hurt the village. \n\nI don't recall the Senju saying anything about Danzo (which, side question, if they rez'd Danzo would he have all his pink eye...).",

All because he wanted Tsunade dead. How are you going to rule over a dead village?\n\n3. Indirect, but the Kage Summit. Him using genjutsu on one of the world leaders to gain power for himself could have resulted in Konoha gaining the ire of every single major ninja nation in the world. And he does this while KNOWING that Ao has a Byakugan.\n\nDanzo consistently acts out of extreme self-interest, and has killed Leaf ninja frequently. The dude has done nothing for the leaf.",
