Tsunade would get a large pile of paperwork, Naruto gets an entire room full of piles.\n\nTsunade also had way more free time, and didn't have to resort to clones even if she could. She still had time to do shit like leading the medical division, doing major surgeries&procedures like she did on Lee, Sasuke & Kakashi (Still wondering how the fuck she got them out of the Tsukyomi when nobody else could), and she'd often go off into battle or join missions during emergencies when she was needed (though half of that was filler).\n\nAnyways Idk why I wrote all this when I still agreed with your main point. I also think people were too harsh on old man Hiruzen. I think people are forgetting that he also needed to build Naruto up to become tough and independent, Naruto had to become capable by himself and experience hardships to become strong for the challenges that he would definitely face in the future as the Kyuubi's jinchuriki, especially since he knew about the Akatsuki.",

Tsunade would get a large pile of paperwork, Naruto gets an entire room full of piles.\n\nTsunade also had way more free time, and didn't have to resort to clones even if she could. She still had time to do shit like leading the medical division, doing major surgeries&procedures like she did on Lee, Sasuke & Kakashi (Still wondering how the fuck she got them out of the Tsukyomi when nobody else could), and she'd often go off into battle or join missions during emergencies when she was needed (though half of that was filler).\n\nAnyways Idk why I wrote all this when I still agreed with your main point. I also think people were too harsh on old man Hiruzen. I think people are forgetting that he also needed to build Naruto up to become tough and independent, Naruto had to become capable by himself and experience hardships to become strong for the challenges that he would definitely face in the future as the Kyuubi's jinchuriki, especially since he knew about the Akatsuki.",

Minato would be happy with what Hiruzen accomplished. It\u2019s like y\u2019all wanted Hiruzen to personally raise Naruto and breastfeed him or something. Naruto even tells Minato he respected the Third a lot and even takes his words and makes it his own in Boruto. \n\nThird Hokage circlejerk is lame imo, not to mention that Naruto has a Godfather in Jiraiya",

Tsunade would get a large pile of paperwork, Naruto gets an entire room full of piles.\n\nTsunade also had way more free time, and didn't have to resort to clones even if she could. She still had time to do shit like leading the medical division, doing major surgeries&procedures like she did on Lee, Sasuke & Kakashi (Still wondering how the fuck she got them out of the Tsukyomi when nobody else could), and she'd often go off into battle or join missions during emergencies when she was needed (though half of that was filler).\n\nAnyways Idk why I wrote all this when I still agreed with your main point. I also think people were too harsh on old man Hiruzen. I think people are forgetting that he also needed to build Naruto up to become tough and independent, Naruto had to become capable by himself and experience hardships to become strong for the challenges that he would definitely face in the future as the Kyuubi's jinchuriki, especially since he knew about the Akatsuki.",

                            "body": ">Fuck, Naruto casually throws around hundreds of clones and he\u2019s barely got time for his own kids and he\u2019s supernaturally vital, which Hiruzen definitely isn\u2019t\n\nAll of your points are fair but this comparison is a bit off.\n\nWe could see from when Tsunade became Hokage that it comes with a lot of work, but this is nothing compared to the village Naruto is running, it's at the very least 10x bigger now, with much more advanced technology, and a shitton more work to do.\n\nThe difference was clearly shown, or at least hinted at, in the sheer difference in paperwork. Tsunade would get a large pile of paperwork, Naruto gets an entire room full of piles.\n\nTsunade also had way more free time, and didn't have to resort to clones even if she could. She still had time to do shit like leading the medical division, doing major surgeries&procedures like she did on Lee, Sasuke & Kakashi (Still wondering how the fuck she got them out of the Tsukyomi when nobody else could), and she'd often go off into battle or join missions during emergencies when she was needed (though half of that was filler).\n\nAnyways Idk why I wrote all this when I still agreed with your main point. I also think people were too harsh on old man Hiruzen. I think people are forgetting that he also needed to build Naruto up to become tough and independent, Naruto had to become capable by himself and experience hardships to become strong for the challenges that he would definitely face in the future as the Kyuubi's jinchuriki, especially since he knew about the Akatsuki.",

In Boruto, he can't sustain clones for a long time even when the no. of clones used is not that high. Before he could spam thousands of them. Now, he gets tired after a big ball Rasengan and stuff.\nIt's pretty bad how nerfed he and Sasuke are.",

Tsunade would get a large pile of paperwork, Naruto gets an entire room full of piles.\n\nTsunade also had way more free time, and didn't have to resort to clones even if she could. She still had time to do shit like leading the medical division, doing major surgeries&procedures like she did on Lee, Sasuke & Kakashi (Still wondering how the fuck she got them out of the Tsukyomi when nobody else could), and she'd often go off into battle or join missions during emergencies when she was needed (though half of that was filler).\n\nAnyways Idk why I wrote all this when I still agreed with your main point. I also think people were too harsh on old man Hiruzen. I think people are forgetting that he also needed to build Naruto up to become tough and independent, Naruto had to become capable by himself and experience hardships to become strong for the challenges that he would definitely face in the future as the Kyuubi's jinchuriki, especially since he knew about the Akatsuki.",

Tsunade would get a large pile of paperwork, Naruto gets an entire room full of piles.\n\nTsunade also had way more free time, and didn't have to resort to clones even if she could. She still had time to do shit like leading the medical division, doing major surgeries&procedures like she did on Lee, Sasuke & Kakashi (Still wondering how the fuck she got them out of the Tsukyomi when nobody else could), and she'd often go off into battle or join missions during emergencies when she was needed (though half of that was filler).\n\nAnyways Idk why I wrote all this when I still agreed with your main point. I also think people were too harsh on old man Hiruzen. I think people are forgetting that he also needed to build Naruto up to become tough and independent, Naruto had to become capable by himself and experience hardships to become strong for the challenges that he would definitely face in the future as the Kyuubi's jinchuriki, especially since he knew about the Akatsuki.",
