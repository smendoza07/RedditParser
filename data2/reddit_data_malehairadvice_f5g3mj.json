I've tried blowdrying, pomade, clay, etc and it can sometimes be fixed for an hour or so but over the course of the day it'll just end up sticking up which looks horrible. I understand it's unrealistic to expect a style to hold up all day, but having it end up like this obviously isn't acceptable. The only thing I've found that can hold it down is hair spray, but that 1) doesn't look great 2) I can't run my hand through my hair without fucking it up\n\n\n\nAny suggestions? Should I just resign to parting my hair closer to the center?",

I\u2019ve  also found the longer you keep it in the better it works instead of treating it like shampoo. Or perhaps try a leave in conditioner. Unless you tried both of those then I am truly out of suggestions \n\nI\u2019m only suggesting conditioner so much  because that\u2019s the only thing have has really helped my stragglers stay down.",

I\u2019ve  also found the longer you keep it in the better it works instead of treating it like shampoo. Or perhaps try a leave in conditioner. Unless you tried both of those then I am truly out of suggestions \n\nI\u2019m only suggesting conditioner so much  because that\u2019s the only thing have has really helped my stragglers stay down.",

I\u2019ve  also found the longer you keep it in the better it works instead of treating it like shampoo. Or perhaps try a leave in conditioner.
