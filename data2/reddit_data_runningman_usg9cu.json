            "body": "That's so interesting. I do have to say, despite being top 10 in number of appearances, this doesn't really correlate to my personal favourite guests (except a few). So I do wonder if it also comes down to relationships and the like. Apart from the family project members, though Kang Hanna and Lee Sang Yeob have guested multiple times outside of those episodes too - I do like them both. Jo Se Ho definitely guests a lot due to YJS connection I feel and because it seems he gets a number of 'last minute' requests (according to the running gag perhaps?). \n\nYonghwa does well on varieties but he was also in the same agency as YJS for the bulk of the early years (FNC) so I can't help but think they pulled some strings esp since he was definitely one of the idols they wanted to push. But also I think early years Running Man had a lot more idols guesting because it was probably more physical and they were at peak popularity while 4th gen idols these days don't seem to appear as much or get invited less. \n\nI was also surprised by APink tbh since I don't really remember them on the show much except for Yang Se Chan and Naeun loveline and them singing with JSJ. But I guess that's the same with Heo Kyunghwan with his thing being how unfunny he is. \n\nOh also I think this is quite a great testament to the RM casting team. The fact that out of 600 episodes, even the top appearing guests only really appeared around ~20 times and a lot of these are more early years (esp the idols). It goes to show how diversified their guest list actually is. That's why to me, it's always more surprisingly when a celeb HASN'T appeared on Running Man. I mean even Gong Yoo and Son Ye Jin have amongst other big A Listers and Hollywood stars.\n\nPS. Great visual! Thanks for sharing.",

IIRC, YJS joining FNC was the reason Yonghwa went into hiatus coz he was investigated for insider trading. Along with him that was investigated for insider trading was one of the CNblue member who was also caught up in the Burning Sun/Molka scandal. It basically killed CNBlue. Yonghwa went into military soon after.\n\nYonghwa, Simon Dominic, Lee Joon was friends of the show at the earliest years. They had good relationship with the members and I'm assuming with the PDs and the fans also love them. That's why they get invited so many times. Same with Apink. Same with Kang Hanna and hopefully Wojae. They're like those coworkers that always say yes to overtime or coverage. The PDs must have them on speed dial.\n\nI'm actually interested on a chart that tracks multiple episode/same shoot guesting as one appearance since it inflates those family package guests.",

I didn't really follow CNBlue but I do remember the Burning Sun issue... Though I thought that was around 2019? It's crazy how CNBlue fell apart. \n\nWas Simon Dominic a frequent guest? Damn I usually remember him since he's good at variety but don't really recall many standout moments of him on RM at all then. I do know Lee Joon was also a popular variety idol (in the era where most groups had *that member that goes on all the varieties*) before he transitioned fully to acting. It's amazing how much his image has changed as a result of his team limiting his variety appearances. I do miss him on variety though. \n\nOh yes I do think PD relationship is also key because RM also went through lots of PD changes and probably that affects their picks as well esp in the case of Kang Hanna. I hope she guests again soon! I wonder if her current drama is on SBS.",

It was one of my favourite runningman theme.\n\nI don't really follow Hanna, but I was just assuming she's more popular now and busier that it's harder for her to guest.

Along with him that was investigated for insider trading was one of the CNblue member who was also caught up in the Burning Sun/Molka scandal. It basically killed CNBlue. Yonghwa went into military soon after.\n\nYonghwa, Simon Dominic, Lee Joon was friends of the show at the earliest years. They had good relationship with the members and I'm assuming with the PDs and the fans also love them. That's why they get invited so many times. Same with Apink. Same with Kang Hanna and hopefully Wojae. They're like those coworkers that always say yes to overtime or coverage. The PDs must have them on speed dial.\n\nI'm actually interested on a chart that tracks multiple episode/same shoot guesting as one appearance since it inflates those family package guests.",

I didn't really follow CNBlue but I do remember the Burning Sun issue... Though I thought that was around 2019? It's crazy how CNBlue fell apart. \n\nWas Simon Dominic a frequent guest? Damn I usually remember him since he's good at variety but don't really recall many standout moments of him on RM at all then. I do know Lee Joon was also a popular variety idol (in the era where most groups had *that member that goes on all the varieties*) before he transitioned fully to acting. It's amazing how much his image has changed as a result of his team limiting his variety appearances. I do miss him on variety though. \n\nOh yes I do think PD relationship is also key because RM also went through lots of PD changes and probably that affects their picks as well esp in the case of Kang Hanna.

I didn't really follow CNBlue but I do remember the Burning Sun issue... Though I thought that was around 2019? It's crazy how CNBlue fell apart. \n\nWas Simon Dominic a frequent guest? Damn I usually remember him since he's good at variety but don't really recall many standout moments of him on RM at all then. I do know Lee Joon was also a popular variety idol (in the era where most groups had *that member that goes on all the varieties*) before he transitioned fully to acting. It's amazing how much his image has changed as a result of his team limiting his variety appearances. I do miss him on variety though. \n\nOh yes I do think PD relationship is also key because RM also went through lots of PD changes and probably that affects their picks as well esp in the case of Kang Hanna. I hope she guests again soon! I wonder if her current drama is on SBS.",
