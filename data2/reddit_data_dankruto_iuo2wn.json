He was born and raised before there were villages when the average life expectancy was merely 30 and there was constant bloodshed. He was the oldest brother and had multiple siblings die so he wanted to be able to protect them and make sure at least Izuna. Then you see him develop an uncommon friendship with a boy who was from the mortal enemy of his family and how cutting off that friendship was a turning point for him mentally as he literally unlocked the Sharingan. He continued fighting against them as usual and was going to consider peace until Izuna died. He accepted peace later on after Hashirama offers to kill himself and gives the village a chance. Then he finds out that his suspicions were right in that the Uchiha were distrusted and that he wouldn't be Hokage because of these sentiments. He tries to convince his clan but they \"betray\" him which leads him astray. All of these events lead him to believe in the idealogy that he spouted later on about how wherever there was a winner (the Senju), there would be a loser (Uchiha) and how in order to end that cycle, you would have to literally take away their free will by putting them in a dream world. The cherry on top was that his actions lead to an unprecedented alliance between 5 enemy nations to combat the threat he posed. He was also not redeemed at the end as he didn't express regret or remorse over his actions and just a bit melancholic that things didn't work out. There's also much more I could bring up but I simply don't care lol. He's veeeeery well-written.",

He was born and raised before there were villages when the average life expectancy was merely 30 and there was constant bloodshed. He was the oldest brother and had multiple siblings die so he wanted to be able to protect them and make sure at least Izuna. Then you see him develop an uncommon friendship with a boy who was from the mortal enemy of his family and how cutting off that friendship was a turning point for him mentally as he literally unlocked the Sharingan. He continued fighting against them as usual and was going to consider peace until Izuna died. He accepted peace later on after Hashirama offers to kill himself and gives the village a chance. Then he finds out that his suspicions were right in that the Uchiha were distrusted and that he wouldn't be Hokage because of these sentiments. He tries to convince his clan but they \"betray\" him which leads him astray. All of these events lead him to believe in the idealogy that he spouted later on about how wherever there was a winner (the Senju), there would be a loser (Uchiha) and how in order to end that cycle, you would have to literally take away their free will by putting them in a dream world. The cherry on top was that his actions lead to an unprecedented alliance between 5 enemy nations to combat the threat he posed. He was also not redeemed at the end as he didn't express regret or remorse over his actions and just a bit melancholic that things didn't work out. There's also much more I could bring up but I simply don't care lol. He's veeeeery well-written.",

He was the oldest brother and had multiple siblings die so he wanted to be able to protect them and make sure at least Izuna. Then you see him develop an uncommon friendship with a boy who was from the mortal enemy of his family and how cutting off that friendship was a turning point for him mentally as he literally unlocked the Sharingan. He continued fighting against them as usual and was going to consider peace until Izuna died. He accepted peace later on after Hashirama offers to kill himself and gives the village a chance. Then he finds out that his suspicions were right in that the Uchiha were distrusted and that he wouldn't be Hokage because of these sentiments. He tries to convince his clan but they \"betray\" him which leads him astray. All of these events lead him to believe in the idealogy that he spouted later on about how wherever there was a winner (the Senju), there would be a loser (Uchiha) and how in order to end that cycle, you would have to literally take away their free will by putting them in a dream world. The cherry on top was that his actions lead to an unprecedented alliance between 5 enemy nations to combat the threat he posed. He was also not redeemed at the end as he didn't express regret or remorse over his actions and just a bit melancholic that things didn't work out. There's also much more I could bring up but I simply don't care lol. He's veeeeery well-written.",
