    "body": "Let's say you're a new SB. You go online, begin your search, and connect with a man who calls himself a SD. Armed with advice from this forum and others, you go on your first m&g, give your POT a PPM \"range\" that you think you're comfortable with, and hope for the best.\n\nYour POT accepts the lower end of your range, promises to be generous with gifts, and agrees to become your SD. Hooray- your search is over (at least for the time being)! A month into the SR- your SD routinely cancels dates on you, forgets your allowance a few times (only to irritably give it to you later on after you gently remind him), has never given you a single gift, regularly hints that he wants to be exclusive and stop wearing condoms with you, and pressures you to host future meets while not so subtly hinting that he might not be able to maintain the SR if you don't start hosting (\"Hotel costs add up!\" he says).\n\nYou find yourself feeling like something is off with your new SR. But since you were totally new to the bowl when you met this man, you don't really have much else to go on to indicate whether this is normal behavior or not. You start to rationalize his behavior and make excuses for him- Of course he accepted the lower end of your range- he's a businessman and is good at making deals, he's a busy man so he sometimes has to cancel dates, he has a lot going on so sometimes he forgets allowance, you don't want to push him away by asking for gifts (maybe you haven't done anything to deserve a gift yet!), he's an older guy so condoms make him lose sensation during sex, you're in a relationship together after all so why not host if you can? You're grateful for the amount that he does give you (when he remembers) but you feel unsatisfied with the arrangement- why?\n\nThe reason why you feel unsatisfied with this type of arrangement is because you gave this man respect that he hadn't earned from you and you settled instead of holding out for a better SR.\n\nThese behavioral issues that I described above are more insidious than issues like outright abuse or accusing you of being \"transactional\" when you expect an allowance. Those are (typically) easy red flags to navigate around because they're right in your face. But it's a lot harder to avoid those other bumps because they can be sneaky or not appear until later on. After all, you expect a man who calls himself a SD to know how to be a SD, right? (wrong)\n\nThere are a few things you absolutely need to do in order to avoid giving unearned respect and settling:\n\n1) **Be confident in yourself and learn when to walk away-** First of all, stop assuming that every man calling himself a SD is a SD. You can call yourself an Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant and that doesn't make it true. Always be wary of the red flags that could show he is not a true SD. **Not every man can afford this lifestyle** or meet your needs. So learn what your needs are and don't waver on them. Stop giving out an allowance range- just say what you want. He can either take it or leave it. Don't want to be exclusive, host, or stop using condoms? Then don't give in to demands like that! Walk away from the things you don't want. Yes that means that a lot of men will be turned off or walk away from you or not be able to afford you- good riddance to them! This actually brings me to my next point:\n\n2) **Always hold out for better-** Do you want to meet Mister Right or Mister Right Now? Because *rarely* does Mister Right just materialize after a day, a week, or even months of searching. If you can't wait 6 months to a year for Mister Right to come along, you may end up settling for a man who exhibits some or all those annoying traits I mentioned above. This is why people tell you not to sugar out of desperation! Someone who is desperate is an easy target for the scammers and salts of the bowl. Accept the fact that you have two options- hold out for a good fit or settle- then decide which you want to do. Bare minimum care and rock bottom allowance should not be your goal. And when you don't accept these things, you actually make the bowl better for everyone else by weeding out these losers and not settling for them out of desperation. If you do decide to settle, at least acknowledge that you're not in an ideal arrangement and don't make excuses for poor (pun intended) treatment.\n\n3) **Hold people accountable/Expect them to keep their promises to you-** In my earlier example, I mentioned that the fictional shitty SD above *specifically* said that he would be generous with gifts, yet a month later gives nothing but PPM every time. Start learning how to hold people accountable- if he mentions that he gives gifts, make wishlist. Send him your wishlist link and point out items that you really want. If he balks at all or is critical of your behavior when you make it clear that you intend to make good on his promises to you- call him out! Remind him of what he promised you. Hold people accountable for their actions and expect people to keep their promises to you- inside and outside of the bowl! Be confident, be shrewd- and you can be both of these things without being bitchy or bratty contrary to popular belief. Stop rewarding bad behavior by continuing to meet with someone who flat out lied to you and purposely misrepresented their generosity. If he can't live up to his promises, walk tf away. \n\n4) **Know that the bowl is not for everyone-** And this includes you too. There's a huge difference between confidence and entitlement. Also respect is a two-way street. Learn how to ask for what you want without being rude. Phrases like \"please\" and \"thank you\" and general expressions of appreciation go a long way. You don't need to be a fully submissive person to be grateful and being confident does not mean sacrificing kindness. Negotiating a SR should not be combative. It's actually pretty simple- state your needs, get a response, decide where you want go from there. If he tries to negotiate further or add caveats you're not comfortable with (exclusivity, no condoms, you hosting, etc), just politely decline and walk away. No need to throw a tantrum, make a scene, or get rude. If you lack the basic maturity to be able to handle disappointment or rejection of your offer, then maybe the bowl is not for you- and that's ok! Again- **The bowl is not for everyone** this includes salty daddies *and* babies who can't mentally handle facing rejection.\n\n5) **Don't give unearned respect-** And there is definitely a way to do this without being rude or \"ruining the fantasy\" for a SD. A confident, secure man does not need you to massage his ego beyond what is necessary. For example- life happens- if you're late to a meet or forgot to wear that special lingerie set he asked you to wear, or whatever, you don't need to beg on hands and knees for forgiveness. A man who can't accept a simple apology is not a man you want to be in a SR with. He's a SD, not a god. Beyond whatever D/s thing you might have going on in your relationship, you can be grateful to him without worshipping and groveling. We all know that male egos can be fragile af at times but they're not all like that all the time. And we as women have a tendency to walk on eggshells around men which doesn't actually help the situation- you just end up not communicating your needs and bottling up your feelings and concerns for fear of upsetting them. If you find yourself regularly subjugating your own emotional or physical needs while propping his up, then you may need to walk away if it can't be fixed because there won't be longevity there and you'll just end up mentally drained while giving your all to him for little in return.\n\n6) **Know the difference between worth and value-** The cash and gifts that you receive from a SD does not equate to your worth, it merely equates to your value in his life. Making whether or not he needs or has time for or can afford a SB *his* problem, not yours. If he can't afford you, even if he tries to hint that you're not \"worth\" your ask, it's not your problem and you can walk away. A SB is a gift in a SD's life to be treasured and he's not buying your soul. You don't need to give up all of your privacy or exhaust the limits of your capacity for emotional labor to be a good SB. This is why it's important to be yourself as much as you possibly can be in a SR. Acting a role you don't actually fit into does nothing but stress you out and cause you to misrepresent yourself (even if it's unintentional). You should also know that if he feels as though you're not adding value to his life, then he should not agree to be in a SR with you and that's ok. Neither party should try to force a round peg through a square hole.\n\nSo in conclusion- stop banging your head against the wall trying to make something work for you when it clearly doesn't. Knowing what you want and not settling for less will lead you towards better quality SRs. Learn when to walk away- both from bad SRs and from the bowl in general when you feel you need to. Don't go doling out undeserved respect just because he's a man, even if he's a man who is promising to pay your bills. Know that your value to him is not the same as your worth to yourself or the world. Be a good communicator- state your needs and don't be wishy washy. Do these things with confidence and grace and you may find that the bowl gets a little easier to navigate! :)",
