    "body": "Okay. So I absolutely love discussions here about sex and how to approach or improve our sex (sugar or vanilla alike), BUT why is it that we can speak so explicitly about sex but NOT about money? Redirecting to the master thread is not adequate when discussions are meant to be contextual.\n\nThis seems severely biased and disadvantages SBs, who are generally already less experienced and more vulnerable (financially). Controlling information in this biased way is a TEXTBOOK oppression tactic used during some of the darkest parts of history.\n\nEdit: Some clarification (since my post is strongly worded). I\u2019m not necessarily accusing anyone of oppressing anyone (though that too is also always worth discussing), but rather to demonstrate the formulaic impact information asymmetry has on disadvantaged people, so predictably that it is used intentionally, throughout history, to exert and control power.",

Probably not. So, just make sure you ask for the allowance you want, so money won't be on your mind all the time. If a man can't afford your allowance, don't negotiate. Move on. \n\nGood luck, OP!",

Some who were actually doing quite well gave up, feeling they were sub standard.  Many who provided more accurate information were slammed on.   A few members later admitted to purposely misrepresenting rates in an attempt to commend more.  Some members posted numbers on their homepage that were off by a factor of 4 from what they stated in the forum.  It was a complete S-show.    The other problem is even without agenda, those who choose to speak up in a forum most probably don\u2019t represent the norm.     \n\nThe information was agenda driven and not accurate, people felt intimidated and it caused riffs that impacted the the entire forum.

There's about 1% that makes enough to sugar and sustain it for awhile. It's hard finding a man who can do it for 30 days, let alone 6 months are longer.\n\nThat's why I can't be upset with SBs having multiple SDs, because one can't pay her rent!",

At the very least I consider a real SD as one who can sustain a regular arrangement which involves at the very least full rent and utilities.  Part time SDs are the same as johns IMO.

That's unavoidable. The goal is to  serve the greater good. Which is the survival of SLF. Without many of the rules we have now have in place to community would have imploded more than once in the past. \n\n> This community is the first that many find, most do not continue to look so this is the default sub.\n> \n> Saying that people should look elsewhere feels like a cop out if the sub isn\u2019t making it clear where people should go.\n\nSo it's my fault that people don't do the proper research and check out multiple sources? And also I should tell grown ups how to use a search feature to find other communities that might better help them with other aspects of this lifestyle that SLF doesn't allow.  lol",

All that would happen in your scenario is SBs who are currently happy with their allowance would become unhappy. And if they dump those guys, they won't find anyone else anyway so end up with 0.

It's not because of men that we can't have these discussions.  It's because of the mods / LaSirene.  And even further - she stated it was not the men causing problems, it was women!\n\nSo can you stop trying to turn this as somehow SDs/men's fault?  Most SD/Men on here want to be able to talk about it also.  You are trying to make a conspiracy out of nothing!\n\nHere is where she confirmed it today.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/uw02ei/why_cant_we_talk_about_money/i9p06yh/",

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments.

And when I joined, money could be freely discussed.\n\nWith that in mind - I want to call out two key things.\n\n1.  This is *not* a gender issue.  Men & Women equally want to talk about money on here.  When this was banned, there was virtually no men in support of banning it.  If you want to pin the blame on someone, I'd say it's LaSirene (the mod), who is a woman.  So again - please do not turn this into a gender debate.  It's not.  \n\n2.  Talking about money is a really slippery slope, that leads to a lot of issues / problems on the sub, and requires a lot of moderator attention.  \n\nBack when we could talk about money here, there was a group of women (for example) who would start responding to everything saying, anything like than XXX (it was a certain number) is exploiting women, and no women should ever accept that.  And then certain men that would respond back saying, I've had dozens of SB, I\"ve never given more than YYY (which was 2.5x lower than they were talking about).\n\nHow is that useful to anyone?  How is it helpful?  Would you expect a 22 year old super model that lives in NYC, to be able to command a higher allowance than an overweight, 30 year old woman in West Virginia, that lives an hour from the nearest population cluster?\n\nWhile talking about region is generally not offensive, trying to dive into the others gets very uncomfortable.",

And also look at some of the responses you are getting.  You talk about how this is \"biased\" towards SBs.  \"Oppressive tactics\".  You don't call out the villain.  But you imply it heavily.

Because even when money is not allowed, people manage to turn it into a \"this side against them\" issue.\n\n> But to address the regional pricing argument - sure!

That led to fights, arguments, accusations of lying or cheapness, and bullying.  Not just in the thread in question -- once people got into arguments about money, then whenever someone posted in another thread, \"you're just a cheap/lying xyz\" followed them.  And yes, though I try to be even handed, though SDs did their share also, it was a brigade of SBs who did a lot of the bullying, especially with any SB who had accepted less than what the group deemed appropriate, and worse yet, were happy with it.  The exact last straw was when these bully SBs ripped into an SB who was perfectly happy in her SR and what she was getting; it just sucked to watch.\n\nWhen the rules changed to no talking about money, a lot of us -- me included --  were skeptical.  But the fact is, for all its faults, the sub runs far better without a self-decided group of people enforcing minimum allowances (and SDs were not guiltless either, in shaming high-$ allowance reports, so no enforcing max allowance either).  The sub works better this way, period.\n\nAnd the fact is, there IS a place to discuss allowances, in the open: The allowance master thread.  Just allowance values, no discussion, bullying, or price cartels allowed, which I suspect is the real complaint.  I'll note with some irony that since this happened years ago, with many people gone or having forgotten the actual reasons, there's been attempts to re-frame this from \"we were behaving badly and starting fights, bullying, and trying to enforce minimums\" to \"slf oppresses women\", in an attempt to completely re-invent the history here (often, in my opinion, by people who I suspect would have been part of the bully crew, based on their posts here or elsewhere).

Price cartel bullying -- to a lesser extent high, to a greater extent low -- is what led to the rule.   We had rules against bullying already, but the mods at the time were not able to control the conversation even with multiple warnings and bans over months -- it's been tried, it didn't work,  people are far too motivated to find ways to keep dragging the conversation to \"you're lying you're not getting that much\" \"you shouldn't take less than $XXX\" etc.\n\nThe effective way to make this sub a place where we can discuss sugar is that rule.  Experience here seems to be that when  you have a very large mixed sub, conversations always veer badly because it's easy for a few bad actors to bring it that way.  Financial information is openly reported -- in the master allowance thread, where no conversation is allowed, the only way to keep the focus on allowance.  People here keep referencing \"conversations about allowance\", as if they'll be dispassionate and factual; those of us here a few years back know what it will really be like.",

This, too, didn't work (and again, as always, the fact that we're continue to try to have this discussion in the way that doesn't turn the sub upside down, is never mentioned), and got dropped, though I'd have to dig up the history to see why.

However, we must reconcile this doctrine with the often encouraged targeting of this kind of SB, in order to \u201chelp someone in need or change their life and feel very appreciated\u201d (I\u2019m thinking of a recent thread about whether an SD would like/dislike an SB who makes good money on her own).

Sorry to be a boomer, but not everything is about oppression and disadvantaged people, especially when you have complete freedom to start a new subreddit and set the rules exactly how you want.

This is a rule, described concisely and enforced fairly.  It goes triple for subs that are hostile to slf and who have a biased and toxic mod team and culture... given that you and others also seem worried that it might be 3-to-2 here, even if those subs allow allowance discussion (in fact, that seems to be their main purpose,  I might argue), I'd think you'd be upset with the lack of any sort of representation.\n\n>I'm very unclear on the intentions of the rules here\n\nWhat you are is disingenuous, the rules are clear.  The members could not discuss allowance without constant battles, so the rules prevent that.   We do not allow linking to other subs, so the rules state that.  At some point this goes from conversation about the sub to intentional disruption.",

The women that made these negative comments had an agenda..! plain and simple! they could care less what the details of the arrangement were, where the SB lived or the SB age , her looks, or  anything else she received besides money. All they cared about was that X was less then what they would accept so it was negatively impacting their perceived value and what they could get in the future",

A SB in oklahoma is not going to get the same as a SB in NYC nor is a SB in South America hoping to get what one in the US gets\n\n\n2. The escorts and women that treat sugar dating like sex work constantly got into arguments, they constantly shamed SB who were in happy SR for accepting less then they would without know where they lived or what their relationship was like. They would also try to shame SD and call them Johns. These women definitely had an agenda, and that agenda was to make sure SB were getting what professionals were getting",

If the SB is happy with the SR, nothing has been de valued. Sure, there's some 70 year old dude who's willing to pay 4x what the average allowance is, but if the SB doesn't want to date him, but chooses someone she's actually attracted to for a lesser allowance, that's her choice and preference. We are humans and there's a lot of factors that go into choosing our partners. We aren't robots. The truth is, there's a limited amount of SDs that can provide that high allowance, Even less that are willing to pay for it. So that means the vast majority of sbs will not be getting those numbers, but average or below rates. Theres simply way more sbs getting in now than before. The market is super saturated.",

It was not something you could moderate because you don't need to use specific words to be a toxic p.o.s.\n\nIn the end every so often someone like you comes along who hasn't experienced it and thinks they can reinvent the wheel.

                                    "body": "> Isn\u2019t there similar shaming here for SBs engaged or interested in online only arrangements \n\nIt's not shaming - it's simply setting boundaries over what a community/sub is for.  \n\nYou are right - this sub does not allow discussion of online only (not the same as platonic) relationships.  Very few people here see that as a bad thing.  It's simply a different audience.  If you were looking for help on how to do better at onlyfans - this is the WRONG place for it.  \n\nNow, regarding platonic (no sex) relationships, I think that's a little bit different.\n\nI will never *shame* someone for wanting a platonic SR.  Why would I?  Hell, I wouldn't mind one.  If you wanted to pay me thousands of dollars a month, to take me out to dinner, and spoil me - I'd be game.  Who WOULDN'T want it?\n\nWhich is ... kinda the whole point.  It's not that different than winning the lottery.\n\nYou say you are coming from a place - where you are worried about vulnerable women.  Any negativity you'd see me post about platonic SRs?  Believe it or not - that's EXACTLY where it's coming from.\n\nPlatonic SRs are very rare;  and typically, they happen by chance to women who are actually open to having sex.  IE:  it's typically the men that are choosing it to be platonic, NOT the woman.  \n\nAs such - women who come in believing platonic relationships are common - end up being more much likely to being scammed, preyed on, etc.  They are more likely to put themselves in a vulnerable position - because the legit SDs have all nexted them.",

Geography, for instance.  $200k annual in tiny town USA may actually allow a lot more sugar than $500k in San Francisco.  \n\nFor someone making $40k in a small town, an $800/month allowance would make a huge differene and may actually help someone more than a $2k allowance in an expensive city.\n\nThat's just one example. Financial values, individual goals, availability, types of dates/expectations, mutual chemistry and more all play into things and can alter appropriate amounts.\n\nSo with the math being all over the place, it can lead to very heated discussions that don't really seem to accomplish much.\n\nAnd most importantly, SA, Reddit and all other web sites have to distance themselves from pay for play talk for legal reasons.",

People \\*should\\* be free to not only SAY whatever they want in terms of sex and money, but also DO whatever they want in terms of sex and money, with obvious implication of being consensual in the act.  \n\nCould you make a 1a argument and successfully defend?  Sure, would you want to?  doubt it.",

Reddit did not want to end up like [Backpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpage)\n\nI believe it is also banned by the mods because discussions about PPM/allowance amounts led to a lot of fighting about what amounts are cheap, bragging or acceptable.  This is an online forum without any way of verifying any claims, without any way of objectively evaluating if an amount is good or bad.  There are too many variables.

And also I should tell grown ups how to use a search feature to find other communities that might better help them with other aspects of this lifestyle that SLF doesn't allow.  lol",

Do you think that those SB will magically find some new SD who does give them this higher amount that they are \"worth\"?\n\nNo. There are limited SD. All that would happen in your scenario is SBs who are currently happy with their allowance would become unhappy. And if they dump those guys, they won't find anyone else anyway so end up with 0. Then they have to go crawling back knowing for a fact that they are the bottom tier of women. Humiliating.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who gives a top tier allowance. The 'market' really doesn't work how you think it does.",

It's not because of men that we can't have these discussions.  It's because of the mods / LaSirene.  And even further - she stated it was not the men causing problems, it was women!\n\nSo can you stop trying to turn this as somehow SDs/men's fault?

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments.

I live in the area with a high cost of living - and pay a ppm that usually covers a good rent for places I myself would live in for weekly meetings.  I get the impression that people think Im really stingy when I do the implied math.\n\nThing is - Im told my ppm is generous, seem to be engaging with top 5-10% in terms of looks and have had no SBs decline to meet me after I throw it out.  Yes, I appear about 30 yo and above average for SDs - but Im not adonis and I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d - which reads as 5\u201d6\u201d-5\u20198\u201d online from what I understand.  people here make me feel like Im living in an alternate universe where SBs are cheap.

And also look at some of the responses you are getting.  You talk about how this is \"biased\" towards SBs.  \"Oppressive tactics\".  You don't call out the villain.  But you imply it heavily.  You imply its men, or SDs, that are making this happen.\n\nYou attempted to paint a villain, thinking it would help your cause.  \nBut it's not.  If it's one person - it's LaSirene23.  Who is a woman.  Who is an SB.  And unfortunately - if anything, it reinforces to the mods why this is a bad idea.  Because even when money is not allowed, people manage to turn it into a \"this side against them\" issue.\n\n> But to address the regional pricing argument - sure! A NYC sugar relationship will inherently be different than a Kansas City sugar relationship.

Are you saying that the later (non-regional information) should not be allowed?  If that's the case, what more do we need than the master allowance thread?",

Price cartel bullying -- to a lesser extent high, to a greater extent low -- is what led to the rule.   We had rules against bullying already, but the mods at the time were not able to control the conversation even with multiple warnings and bans over months -- it's been tried, it didn't work,  people are far too motivated to find ways to keep dragging the conversation to \"you're lying you're not getting that much\" \"you shouldn't take less than $XXX\" etc.\n\nThe effective way to make this sub a place where we can discuss sugar is that rule.  Experience here seems to be that when  you have a very large mixed sub, conversations always veer badly because it's easy for a few bad actors to bring it that way.  Financial information is openly reported -- in the master allowance thread, where no conversation is allowed, the only way to keep the focus on allowance.  People here keep referencing \"conversations about allowance\", as if they'll be dispassionate and factual; those of us here a few years back know what it will really be like.",

I do think it's important to learn from things that didn't work, take some time to heal the bruises, and try another approach.  Which u/LaSirene23 did a few months ago -- she started posting a regular \"let's talk about allowance\" thread, under the theory that we would allow allowance discussion there (to address some of the concerns here) while walling it off to a single thread (to make it mod-able).  This, too, didn't work (and again, as always, the fact that we're continue to try to have this discussion in the way that doesn't turn the sub upside down, is never mentioned), and got dropped, though I'd have to dig up the history to see why.  I don't know what the next approach will be, or when.",

This is a rule, described concisely and enforced fairly.  It goes triple for subs that are hostile to slf and who have a biased and toxic mod team and culture... given that you and others also seem worried that it might be 3-to-2 here, even if those subs allow allowance discussion (in fact, that seems to be their main purpose,  I might argue), I'd think you'd be upset with the lack of any sort of representation.\n\n>I'm very unclear on the intentions of the rules here\n\nWhat you are is disingenuous, the rules are clear.  The members could not discuss allowance without constant battles, so the rules prevent that.   We do not allow linking to other subs, so the rules state that.  At some point this goes from conversation about the sub to intentional disruption.",

I have learned a lot in this discussion, and I have suggested new ways to approach the problem that it haven\u2019t been tried before. \n\nI am a little confused why the response from a mod has been \u201cnope, go to another subreddit if you want to speak freely about money\u201d, yet when I try to provide the community that I know of (and to which I believe their referencing) that content is ALSO moderated. Surely you can understand my confusion there. How are  under-served and under-informed people supposed to get this information? We are all people trying to help each other out here (at least I am). I\u2019m getting some mixed messages, when I\u2019m very simply trying to problem solve given your own constraints. I am almost forced to accept now that the mods don\u2019t want SBs to know how much money other SBs receive at all no matter the subreddit, let alone that the reason for censorship is to avoid bullying, or \u201cbitches\u201d \u201cbullshit\u201d as the one mod ironically put it. \n\nCalling me disingenuous means you fail to grasp both the problem I\u2019m proposing and the landscape of the problem. Honestly, I\u2019ve been really patient, cordial and receptive, and would really appreciate you refraining from insults or accusing me of malintent (like gaslighting!) while we discuss something we both care about.",

Not because the mods don't want SBs to get allowance info, there's plenty in the allowance master thread, otherwise they're free to search out other subs. That's okay though -- anyone who wants to can find that other sub easily, and as you may be aware, that sub DMs many SBs who post here.

I always find it funny how 5% of guys who like the \"one off\" seems to be 50% of men to women lol. It just doesn't happen like that. It's not actually de valuing though. If the SB is happy with the SR, nothing has been de valued. Sure, there's some 70 year old dude who's willing to pay 4x what the average allowance is, but if the SB doesn't want to date him, but chooses someone she's actually attracted to for a lesser allowance, that's her choice and preference. We are humans and there's a lot of factors that go into choosing our partners. We aren't robots. The truth is, there's a limited amount of SDs that can provide that high allowance, Even less that are willing to pay for it. So that means the vast majority of sbs will not be getting those numbers, but average or below rates. Theres simply way more sbs getting in now than before. The market is super saturated.",

There isn't going to be some magic unionization happening and even if it did, all that would lead to is SB getting cut for thinking they are somehow on the same level. \nSDs don't just come in new batches just because you want them to. On top SBs are not at all related to their income generation, so it's a silly concept.\n\nI think the problem is that you simply were not around when it was allowed. It was an absolute shit show. And the toxicity was almost completely from 'SBs' bullying, harassing and making other women feel bad. It was not something you could moderate because you don't need to use specific words to be a toxic p.o.s.\n\nIn the end every so often someone like you comes along who hasn't experienced it and thinks they can reinvent the wheel. But it's been tried many times. The sub is far far better off the way it is now, and seeing the other male and female only subs where this is allowed proves that this sub is doing well.",

This is not blaming any group it is the fact that Facebook does acknowledge using the law for censorship.\n\nI can send you my presentation on \"why we should care about censorship.\" That goes into details on how bad the law is written that it censors anyone who uses the words that are obscene or refer to sex. I should know because it has been a pain in my ass since 2018.   \n\n\nI have a podcast called Sex Positive Me, a podcast that destigmatizes the conversation about sex.  When the law went into effect my business emails were blocked by my isp (internet service provider). Because of the word sex, it took me a week to get access to my emails and apologize to my clients for the emails not coming or going through.   \n\n\nWhat FOSTA-SESTA did, was create an exception that would make websites legally liable for any content that helped facilitate sex trafficking or prostitution \u2014 even if it was consensual.  \nBased on the law, Sugar Dating is illegal.   \n\n\nThe law was written to stop Sex Trafficking and to shut down Backpage. It was not used to shut down Backpage, and today the law has been used to arrest people for Sex Trafficking. \n\nIt has made it very difficult for law enforcement to really help those that are really being sex trafficked as these websites worked with them.   \n\n\nI am not a complete expert but always stay on top of the laws that will affect me.",

It\u2019s so unaware. That\u2019s what sex work is. Sure, a bit different due to not being hourly and more emotionally invested- but it\u2019s arguably more affordable sex work at that point. Escorts don\u2019t usually want to go to dinner and be intimate with clients on the level SD/SB is. If your exchanging money for sexual relationships or intimacy your participating in sex work.",

Very few people here see that as a bad thing.  It's simply a different audience.  If you were looking for help on how to do better at onlyfans - this is the WRONG place for it.  \n\nNow, regarding platonic (no sex) relationships, I think that's a little bit different.\n\nI will never *shame* someone for wanting a platonic SR.  Why would I?  Hell, I wouldn't mind one.  If you wanted to pay me thousands of dollars a month, to take me out to dinner, and spoil me - I'd be game.  Who WOULDN'T want it?\n\nWhich is ... kinda the whole point.  It's not that different than winning the lottery.\n\nYou say you are coming from a place - where you are worried about vulnerable women.  Any negativity you'd see me post about platonic SRs?  Believe it or not - that's EXACTLY where it's coming from.\n\nPlatonic SRs are very rare;  and typically, they happen by chance to women who are actually open to having sex.  IE:  it's typically the men that are choosing it to be platonic, NOT the woman.  \n\nAs such - women who come in believing platonic relationships are common - end up being more much likely to being scammed, preyed on, etc.  They are more likely to put themselves in a vulnerable position - because the legit SDs have all nexted them.",

All that would happen in your scenario is SBs who are currently happy with their allowance would become unhappy. And if they dump those guys, they won't find anyone else anyway so end up with 0.

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments. Everyone likes bragging, so it's just a festering ground for women to become insecure.",

But people tell me its not worth it for her.

In fact I feel bad for them - whatever these people get has to go through the filter of their tendency to undervalue things.  So they are basicallt getting less utility out of it.  They could be worse off in terms of real benefit than people who make a 1/3rd of what they do.",

And also look at some of the responses you are getting.  You talk about how this is \"biased\" towards SBs.  \"Oppressive tactics\".  You don't call out the villain.  But you imply it heavily.  You imply its men, or SDs, that are making this happen.\n\nYou attempted to paint a villain, thinking it would help your cause.  \nBut it's not.  If it's one person - it's LaSirene23.  Who is a woman.  Who is an SB.  And unfortunately - if anything, it reinforces to the mods why this is a bad idea.  Because even when money is not allowed, people manage to turn it into a \"this side against them\" issue.\n\n> But to address the regional pricing argument - sure! A NYC sugar relationship will inherently be different than a Kansas City sugar relationship. However, the discussion is still valuable for SBs, especially if their young and more likely to move and explore before establishing long term residence in a specific city.\n\n> You also mentions age and attractiveness (by mainstream beauty standards) in your example, and that is not regional. Information about money with regards to opportunity (even if based on superficial reasons) is valuable to everyone.\n\nWhat is your point?  I'm not sure what you are trying to say with this.  Are you saying that the later (non-regional information) should not be allowed?  If that's the case, what more do we need than the master allowance thread?",

Price cartel bullying -- to a lesser extent high, to a greater extent low -- is what led to the rule.   We had rules against bullying already, but the mods at the time were not able to control the conversation even with multiple warnings and bans over months -- it's been tried, it didn't work,  people are far too motivated to find ways to keep dragging the conversation to \"you're lying you're not getting that much\" \"you shouldn't take less than $XXX\" etc.\n\nThe effective way to make this sub a place where we can discuss sugar is that rule.  Experience here seems to be that when  you have a very large mixed sub, conversations always veer badly because it's easy for a few bad actors to bring it that way.  Financial information is openly reported -- in the master allowance thread, where no conversation is allowed, the only way to keep the focus on allowance.  People here keep referencing \"conversations about allowance\", as if they'll be dispassionate and factual; those of us here a few years back know what it will really be like.",

Honestly, I\u2019ve been really patient, cordial and receptive, and would really appreciate you refraining from insults or accusing me of malintent (like gaslighting!) while we discuss something we both care about.",

There's a rule that we don't allow advertisement of other subs, there's no intention to be clear on other than we don't want to let other subs leverage this sub. Not because the mods don't want SBs to get allowance info, there's plenty in the allowance master thread, otherwise they're free to search out other subs. That's okay though -- anyone who wants to can find that other sub easily, and as you may be aware, that sub DMs many SBs who post here.  You don't  need to solve the problem of other SBs finding that sub, the sub will find them, or they'll do a search.  In the meantime, there's many datapoints in the allowance master thread.\n\nWe tried to address the topic of discussing allowance very recently. It didn't work, but we'll try again someday.

A SB would post that she\u2019s in a very happy SR and i get X per week, and would have a question unrelated to her allowance, the next thing you know some women would say that\u2019s much too low, you\u2019re getting exploited blah blah blah. Meanwhile this woman was perfectly happy gushing about her SR and not even asking anything about the allowance. This type of situation happened again and again. The women that made these negative comments had an agenda..! plain and simple! they could care less what the details of the arrangement were, where the SB lived or the SB age , her looks, or  anything else she received besides money. All they cared about was that X was less then what they would accept so it was negatively impacting their perceived value and what they could get in the future",

If the SB is happy with the SR, nothing has been de valued. Sure, there's some 70 year old dude who's willing to pay 4x what the average allowance is, but if the SB doesn't want to date him, but chooses someone she's actually attracted to for a lesser allowance, that's her choice and preference. We are humans and there's a lot of factors that go into choosing our partners. We aren't robots. The truth is, there's a limited amount of SDs that can provide that high allowance, Even less that are willing to pay for it. So that means the vast majority of sbs will not be getting those numbers, but average or below rates. Theres simply way more sbs getting in now than before. The market is super saturated.",

And the toxicity was almost completely from 'SBs' bullying, harassing and making other women feel bad. It was not something you could moderate because you don't need to use specific words to be a toxic p.o.s.\n\nIn the end every so often someone like you comes along who hasn't experienced it and thinks they can reinvent the wheel.

Unless said hoes are soliciting sex for money.\n\nMany content providers made the decision to err on the side of caution. For example, the Craigslist personals; far from all of those ads were sex-for-money but CL just shut it all down.

My favorite story is a town in England called Plymouth Hoe that Facebook did apologize for flagging them for using an offensive term in their name.  This is not blaming any group it is the fact that Facebook does acknowledge using the law for censorship.\n\nI can send you my presentation on \"why we should care about censorship.\" That goes into details on how bad the law is written that it censors anyone who uses the words that are obscene or refer to sex. I should know because it has been a pain in my ass since 2018.   \n\n\nI have a podcast called Sex Positive Me, a podcast that destigmatizes the conversation about sex.  When the law went into effect my business emails were blocked by my isp (internet service provider). Because of the word sex, it took me a week to get access to my emails and apologize to my clients for the emails not coming or going through.   \n\n\nWhat FOSTA-SESTA did, was create an exception that would make websites legally liable for any content that helped facilitate sex trafficking or prostitution \u2014 even if it was consensual.  \nBased on the law, Sugar Dating is illegal.   \n\n\nThe law was written to stop Sex Trafficking and to shut down Backpage. It was not used to shut down Backpage, and today the law has been used to arrest people for Sex Trafficking. \n\nIt has made it very difficult for law enforcement to really help those that are really being sex trafficked as these websites worked with them.   \n\n\nI am not a complete expert but always stay on top of the laws that will affect me.",

Very few people here see that as a bad thing.  It's simply a different audience.  If you were looking for help on how to do better at onlyfans - this is the WRONG place for it.  \n\nNow, regarding platonic (no sex) relationships, I think that's a little bit different.\n\nI will never *shame* someone for wanting a platonic SR.  Why would I?  Hell, I wouldn't mind one.  If you wanted to pay me thousands of dollars a month, to take me out to dinner, and spoil me - I'd be game.  Who WOULDN'T want it?\n\nWhich is ... kinda the whole point.  It's not that different than winning the lottery.\n\nYou say you are coming from a place - where you are worried about vulnerable women.  Any negativity you'd see me post about platonic SRs?  Believe it or not - that's EXACTLY where it's coming from.\n\nPlatonic SRs are very rare;  and typically, they happen by chance to women who are actually open to having sex.  IE:  it's typically the men that are choosing it to be platonic, NOT the woman.  \n\nAs such - women who come in believing platonic relationships are common - end up being more much likely to being scammed, preyed on, etc.  They are more likely to put themselves in a vulnerable position - because the legit SDs have all nexted them.",

I think tho that you insinuating that people just sort of pull this statement out of their ass is rather obtuse.  \n\nYou are certainly aware that the kinds of discussion that I referred to are not the kind of generic discussions (which is why I also mentioned explicit) that would maybe skirt around the legal definitions.  \n\n Here, for your reference (I believe all states except maybe a county in Nevada have similar laws). -> [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App\\_mode=Display\\_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0796/Sections/0796.07.html](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0796/Sections/0796.07.html)\n\n2f -> To solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution, lewdness, or assignation.\n\nI am no lawyer and have never crossed this line personally, or really known anyone to have done so. \n\nThat said, a layman's reading of the law would seem to indicate a sex forward forum that openly discusses sex in terms of money, especially when describing specific sex acts etc.. would run afoul of 2f.  particularly, \"induce\" and \"entice\".\n\ninduce -  1) \"succeed in persuading or influencing (someone) to do something\" 2) \"bring about or give rise to\"\n\nentice - \"attract or tempt by offering pleasure or advantage.\"\n\nI think the law is dumb, tbh.  People \\*should\\* be free to not only SAY whatever they want in terms of sex and money, but also DO whatever they want in terms of sex and money, with obvious implication of being consensual in the act.  \n\nCould you make a 1a argument and successfully defend?  Sure, would you want to?  doubt it.",

All that would happen in your scenario is SBs who are currently happy with their allowance would become unhappy. And if they dump those guys, they won't find anyone else anyway so end up with 0.

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments. Everyone likes bragging, so it's just a festering ground for women to become insecure.",

And also look at some of the responses you are getting.  You talk about how this is \"biased\" towards SBs.  \"Oppressive tactics\".  You don't call out the villain.  But you imply it heavily.

I do think it's important to learn from things that didn't work, take some time to heal the bruises, and try another approach.  Which u/LaSirene23 did a few months ago -- she started posting a regular \"let's talk about allowance\" thread, under the theory that we would allow allowance discussion there (to address some of the concerns here) while walling it off to a single thread (to make it mod-able).  This, too, didn't work (and again, as always, the fact that we're continue to try to have this discussion in the way that doesn't turn the sub upside down, is never mentioned), and got dropped, though I'd have to dig up the history to see why.  I don't know what the next approach will be, or when.",

We all talk about the same women and who we think is good looking. I always find it funny how 5% of guys who like the \"one off\" seems to be 50% of men to women lol. It just doesn't happen like that. It's not actually de valuing though. If the SB is happy with the SR, nothing has been de valued. Sure, there's some 70 year old dude who's willing to pay 4x what the average allowance is, but if the SB doesn't want to date him, but chooses someone she's actually attracted to for a lesser allowance, that's her choice and preference. We are humans and there's a lot of factors that go into choosing our partners. We aren't robots. The truth is, there's a limited amount of SDs that can provide that high allowance, Even less that are willing to pay for it. So that means the vast majority of sbs will not be getting those numbers, but average or below rates. Theres simply way more sbs getting in now than before. The market is super saturated.",

There isn't going to be some magic unionization happening and even if it did, all that would lead to is SB getting cut for thinking they are somehow on the same level. \nSDs don't just come in new batches just because you want them to. On top SBs are not at all related to their income generation, so it's a silly concept.\n\nI think the problem is that you simply were not around when it was allowed. It was an absolute shit show. And the toxicity was almost completely from 'SBs' bullying, harassing and making other women feel bad. It was not something you could moderate because you don't need to use specific words to be a toxic p.o.s.\n\nIn the end every so often someone like you comes along who hasn't experienced it and thinks they can reinvent the wheel. But it's been tried many times. The sub is far far better off the way it is now, and seeing the other male and female only subs where this is allowed proves that this sub is doing well.",

This is not blaming any group it is the fact that Facebook does acknowledge using the law for censorship.\n\nI can send you my presentation on \"why we should care about censorship.\" That goes into details on how bad the law is written that it censors anyone who uses the words that are obscene or refer to sex. I should know because it has been a pain in my ass since 2018.   \n\n\nI have a podcast called Sex Positive Me, a podcast that destigmatizes the conversation about sex.  When the law went into effect my business emails were blocked by my isp (internet service provider). Because of the word sex, it took me a week to get access to my emails and apologize to my clients for the emails not coming or going through.   \n\n\nWhat FOSTA-SESTA did, was create an exception that would make websites legally liable for any content that helped facilitate sex trafficking or prostitution \u2014 even if it was consensual.  \nBased on the law, Sugar Dating is illegal.   \n\n\nThe law was written to stop Sex Trafficking and to shut down Backpage. It was not used to shut down Backpage, and today the law has been used to arrest people for Sex Trafficking. \n\nIt has made it very difficult for law enforcement to really help those that are really being sex trafficked as these websites worked with them.   \n\n\nI am not a complete expert but always stay on top of the laws that will affect me.",

Very few people here see that as a bad thing.  It's simply a different audience.  If you were looking for help on how to do better at onlyfans - this is the WRONG place for it.  \n\nNow, regarding platonic (no sex) relationships, I think that's a little bit different.\n\nI will never *shame* someone for wanting a platonic SR.  Why would I?  Hell, I wouldn't mind one.  If you wanted to pay me thousands of dollars a month, to take me out to dinner, and spoil me - I'd be game.  Who WOULDN'T want it?\n\nWhich is ... kinda the whole point.  It's not that different than winning the lottery.\n\nYou say you are coming from a place - where you are worried about vulnerable women.  Any negativity you'd see me post about platonic SRs?  Believe it or not - that's EXACTLY where it's coming from.\n\nPlatonic SRs are very rare;  and typically, they happen by chance to women who are actually open to having sex.  IE:  it's typically the men that are choosing it to be platonic, NOT the woman.  \n\nAs such - women who come in believing platonic relationships are common - end up being more much likely to being scammed, preyed on, etc.  They are more likely to put themselves in a vulnerable position - because the legit SDs have all nexted them.",

Do you think that those SB will magically find some new SD who does give them this higher amount that they are \"worth\"?\n\nNo. There are limited SD. All that would happen in your scenario is SBs who are currently happy with their allowance would become unhappy. And if they dump those guys, they won't find anyone else anyway so end up with 0. Then they have to go crawling back knowing for a fact that they are the bottom tier of women. Humiliating.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who gives a top tier allowance.

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments.

My goal isn't to appease individuals but to make sure SLF survives long after those individuals leave.",

Meanwhile this woman was perfectly happy gushing about her SR and not even asking anything about the allowance. This type of situation happened again and again. The women that made these negative comments had an agenda..! plain and simple! they could care less what the details of the arrangement were, where the SB lived or the SB age , her looks, or  anything else she received besides money. All they cared about was that X was less then what they would accept so it was negatively impacting their perceived value and what they could get in the future",

We all talk about the same women and who we think is good looking. I always find it funny how 5% of guys who like the \"one off\" seems to be 50% of men to women lol. It just doesn't happen like that. It's not actually de valuing though. If the SB is happy with the SR, nothing has been de valued. Sure, there's some 70 year old dude who's willing to pay 4x what the average allowance is, but if the SB doesn't want to date him, but chooses someone she's actually attracted to for a lesser allowance, that's her choice and preference. We are humans and there's a lot of factors that go into choosing our partners. We aren't robots. The truth is, there's a limited amount of SDs that can provide that high allowance, Even less that are willing to pay for it. So that means the vast majority of sbs will not be getting those numbers, but average or below rates. Theres simply way more sbs getting in now than before. The market is super saturated.",

Then you have others can barely trace lines and everything in between the 2 extremes.\n\nIt doesn't matter in the slightest what someone else is getting for offers because it doesn't apply to *you*. There isn't going to be some magic unionization happening and even if it did, all that would lead to is SB getting cut for thinking they are somehow on the same level. \nSDs don't just come in new batches just because you want them to. On top SBs are not at all related to their income generation, so it's a silly concept.\n\nI think the problem is that you simply were not around when it was allowed. It was an absolute shit show. And the toxicity was almost completely from 'SBs' bullying, harassing and making other women feel bad. It was not something you could moderate because you don't need to use specific words to be a toxic p.o.s.\n\nIn the end every so often someone like you comes along who hasn't experienced it and thinks they can reinvent the wheel. But it's been tried many times. The sub is far far better off the way it is now, and seeing the other male and female only subs where this is allowed proves that this sub is doing well.",

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments. Everyone likes bragging, so it's just a festering ground for women to become insecure.",

Honestly, do you really think that the people who are paying the cash and are in the minority are the ones who benefit?\n\n1) You realise that if those you don't consider up to standard disappear, it's not like there will magically be a new can of SD to pull from right? The already small pool of SD will be even more limited. How are you going to compete with all the other SB for even fewer SD?\n\n2) Do you understand that not every SB can command the same allowance? You may not have the same amount of time, may not be as available or as exclusive. Hell, let's be brutally honest here, you may simply not be as good looking or fun.\nThen you come here and see a number that nobody is offering you. How does that make you feel about yourself? You may have been perfectly happy before and now you feel utterly inadequate.\n\nEven putting aside those points, the discussion itself is pointless. There are so many factors that go into an offer that can never be encompassed by some random self reported comments. Everyone likes bragging, so it's just a festering ground for women to become insecure.",
