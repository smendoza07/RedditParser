            "body": "Just wanted to share these in case anyone has been on the fence about starting any medicated treatment for hairloss. \n\nI\u2019m 24, started slowly losing my hair shortly after my 20th birthday. Then with all the stress of 2020 it kicked into overdrive and brought me to my \u201cbefore\u201d photos. In November I began taking Finasteride once a day, derma-rolling about 1-2x per week, and using liquid Minoxidil twice per day. Results aren\u2019t 100% where I\u2019d like them to be yet, but I\u2019m quite thrilled with my results so far. \n\nIf anyone has any questions please feel free to reach out. I know how devastating this can be to your happiness and health, so I hope this can be of use to someone in a similar situation.",

Pairing it with Minoxidil is what REALLY seems to make the difference from everything I\u2019ve read. The two aren\u2019t amazing on their own, but together they seem to do really well. I\u2019m also taking vitamins like Iron, Biotin, and Vitamin D (but I don\u2019t know if that is having any effect on the hair).",

Reports are conflicting as to whether or not it should be done more frequently, so I just stuck with 1-2 times per week for safety. I can\u2019t say for certain that the derma rolling has made an impact, but it sure *feels* like it has. I\u2019ve always viewed it as \u201ctilling the soil\u201d before \u201cplanting seeds\u201d; so to speak. Maybe it\u2019s all just a placebo effect but it seems to be working so I won\u2019t question it, haha",

Minoxidil (generic Rogaine) can be bought in foam or liquid form off the shelf at Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc. It\u2019s usually sitting with the shampoos or whatever and might be called \u201chair regrowth treatment\u201d or something like that. Just check for the word MINOXIDIL on the box somewhere. \n\nMy routine:\n\n1.) When I wake up I put the Minoxidil on my head and rub it in (I use the liquid). I don\u2019t wash it out, I leave it on my scalp all day. \n\n2.) Around 5:00pm I take my Finasteride pill with food. \n\n3.) When I shower at night I\u2019ll wash out the old Minoxidil with just water and conditioner. Shampoo dries my hair/scalp out too much. When I get out of the shower I derma-roll the problem areas of my scalp then apply the Minoxidil once again (only derma roll 1-2x per week though). I leave it in all night, and once it\u2019s dry I\u2019ll put on a beanie to sleep in so I don\u2019t get any minoxidil residue on my pillows or sheets because it can stain things. \n\nTLDR: Minoxidil 2x per day, Finasteride 1x per day. Derma roll on occasion.",

Minoxidil (generic Rogaine) can be bought in foam or liquid form off the shelf at Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc. It\u2019s usually sitting with the shampoos or whatever and might be called \u201chair regrowth treatment\u201d or something like that. Just check for the word MINOXIDIL on the box somewhere. \n\nMy routine:\n\n1.) When I wake up I put the Minoxidil on my head and rub it in (I use the liquid). I don\u2019t wash it out, I leave it on my scalp all day. \n\n2.) Around 5:00pm I take my Finasteride pill with food. \n\n3.) When I shower at night I\u2019ll wash out the old Minoxidil with just water and conditioner. Shampoo dries my hair/scalp out too much. When I get out of the shower I derma-roll the problem areas of my scalp then apply the Minoxidil once again (only derma roll 1-2x per week though). I leave it in all night, and once it\u2019s dry I\u2019ll put on a beanie to sleep in so I don\u2019t get any minoxidil residue on my pillows or sheets because it can stain things. \n\nTLDR: Minoxidil 2x per day, Finasteride 1x per day. Derma roll on occasion.",

Minoxidil (generic Rogaine) can be bought in foam or liquid form off the shelf at Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc. It\u2019s usually sitting with the shampoos or whatever and might be called \u201chair regrowth treatment\u201d or something like that. Just check for the word MINOXIDIL on the box somewhere. \n\nMy routine:\n\n1.) When I wake up I put the Minoxidil on my head and rub it in (I use the liquid). I don\u2019t wash it out, I leave it on my scalp all day. \n\n2.) Around 5:00pm I take my Finasteride pill with food. \n\n3.) When I shower at night I\u2019ll wash out the old Minoxidil with just water and conditioner. Shampoo dries my hair/scalp out too much. When I get out of the shower I derma-roll the problem areas of my scalp then apply the Minoxidil once again (only derma roll 1-2x per week though). I leave it in all night, and once it\u2019s dry I\u2019ll put on a beanie to sleep in so I don\u2019t get any minoxidil residue on my pillows or sheets because it can stain things. \n\nTLDR: Minoxidil 2x per day, Finasteride 1x per day. Derma roll on occasion.",

Minoxidil (generic Rogaine) can be bought in foam or liquid form off the shelf at Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc. It\u2019s usually sitting with the shampoos or whatever and might be called \u201chair regrowth treatment\u201d or something like that. Just check for the word MINOXIDIL on the box somewhere. \n\nMy routine:\n\n1.) When I wake up I put the Minoxidil on my head and rub it in (I use the liquid). I don\u2019t wash it out, I leave it on my scalp all day. \n\n2.) Around 5:00pm I take my Finasteride pill with food. \n\n3.) When I shower at night I\u2019ll wash out the old Minoxidil with just water and conditioner. Shampoo dries my hair/scalp out too much. When I get out of the shower I derma-roll the problem areas of my scalp then apply the Minoxidil once again (only derma roll 1-2x per week though). I leave it in all night, and once it\u2019s dry I\u2019ll put on a beanie to sleep in so I don\u2019t get any minoxidil residue on my pillows or sheets because it can stain things. \n\nTLDR: Minoxidil 2x per day, Finasteride 1x per day. Derma roll on occasion.",
