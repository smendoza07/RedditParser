The main problem was that every, and I do mean EVERY, girl I talked to just wanted to sell online, SB online, videos, phone calls, etc. The worst part was I wasn\u2019t even looking for an intimate relationship, just dinners dates. \n\nDone!

No emotional connection, PPM based, SB only gets money when sex occurs. \n\nSugar relationships are much closer to real relationships, they might be casual and open or they might be exclusive. Typically they would include romance, affection, emotional connection, daily communication, no score keeping. Usually mixture of intimate and platonic dates because it\u2019s a relationship",

Thanks to  this forum I learned to make my profile private which eliminated 99% of the scams and sellers.  I narrowly avoided a rinser or two as well along the way.   Most of the chats fizzled out pretty quick, some due to the holidays at the time.  Best advice I got was not to get attached to a specific potential.  Most self filter along the way and you can't get upset if the one you liked didn't respond or ghosts you or whatever.   Until they become your SB, anything can happen and honestly, even after they're your SB anything can still happen. Point is, as an SD if you're doing it right, you'll get results and if you're not getting results over time, you're  not doing it right.",

I'll admit it was a rollercoaster of emotion, ups and downs and lots of frustration along the way, so I get it.\n\nI started on SA over 6 years ago before Fosta/Cesta, back then I could go on 4 meet and greets and find 1 good SB. Typically I would pay for 2 months go on 8 to 10 meet and greets, find 2 to 3 good POTs, go on 2 to 3 dates with them each, usually one might flake before an intimate date, and 1 out of 2 of them you'd have good connection and chemistry with, and find a good SR that lasted 3 months to at least a year.\n\nFosta/Sesta made it a bit tougher because of the influx of sex workers and Johns.\n\nThen Covid made it even worse, because in 2020 was the rise of OnlyFans and every women became an online sex worker, and all came to Seeking trying to push their OF or sell content. With 2 years of no in person college, the whole demographic of college girls which on SA makes up 90% of the members at any given time, really made it harder.\n\nNow that things are somewhat back to normal, the only difference Ive seen, is now instead of going on 4 to 5 meet and greets to find 1 good SB, it takes twice as many. Its just a numbers game now.",

No emotional connection, PPM based, SB only gets money when sex occurs. \n\nSugar relationships are much closer to real relationships, they might be casual and open or they might be exclusive.

Either how they look, how they act or communicate, or possibly their location.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I can't say what SA was years ago because I just tried it a couple months ago for the first time.  I will say that with some great advice from this forum, I started conversations with several potentials and within 2 or 3 weeks had 2 SB's out  of it with some really nice intimate meet  ups.  That was in December during the holiday season by the way with girls in their  early 20's and I'm mid 50's.   So yeah, even now it can be done but a lot of its a numbers game.   I'll admit it was a rollercoaster of emotion, ups and downs and lots of frustration along the way, so I get it.\n\nI started on SA over 6 years ago before Fosta/Cesta, back then I could go on 4 meet and greets and find 1 good SB. Typically I would pay for 2 months go on 8 to 10 meet and greets, find 2 to 3 good POTs, go on 2 to 3 dates with them each, usually one might flake before an intimate date, and 1 out of 2 of them you'd have good connection and chemistry with, and find a good SR that lasted 3 months to at least a year.\n\nFosta/Sesta made it a bit tougher because of the influx of sex workers and Johns.\n\nThen Covid made it even worse, because in 2020 was the rise of OnlyFans and every women became an online sex worker, and all came to Seeking trying to push their OF or sell content. With 2 years of no in person college, the whole demographic of college girls which on SA makes up 90% of the members at any given time, really made it harder.\n\nNow that things are somewhat back to normal, the only difference Ive seen, is now instead of going on 4 to 5 meet and greets to find 1 good SB, it takes twice as many. Its just a numbers game now.",

No emotional connection, PPM based, SB only gets money when sex occurs. \n\nSugar relationships are much closer to real relationships, they might be casual and open or they might be exclusive.

No emotional connection, PPM based, SB only gets money when sex occurs. \n\nSugar relationships are much closer to real relationships, they might be casual and open or they might be exclusive. Typically they would include romance, affection, emotional connection, daily communication, no score keeping. Usually mixture of intimate and platonic dates because it\u2019s a relationship",
