Also, be careful with people who say it is \"just a mature hairline\". A mature hairline is a form of balding, the question is how far back your hairline will progress. In about 25% of men it just keeps going as you age, and yours is already pretty far back, probably a NW2. Still early enough that with finasteride it probably wouldn't progress any further. Just remember, time is your enemy. Once a follicle shrinks small enough (usually \\~2 years after it disappears), it's gone forever and you'll never get it back, so don't keep putting this off if you want to be proactive about keeping your hair. Your best option is to visit a dermatologist who can measure your hair follicles and track your hair loss.",
