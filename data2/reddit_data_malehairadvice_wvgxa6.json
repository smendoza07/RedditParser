What i would do in all honesty is i would cut it shorter and add some texturizing stuff to it and give it some more texture so it\u2019s not just flat if you know what i mean. Again, just my opinion",

You have too much of it in the front and it's obscuring the shape of your face and the details. Try pulling some it back while having some in the front, and the left pic looked a bit better than the middle part. Maybe try getting a stylist to add some texture or layer it as well.\n\nR/fierceflow would have a lot of similar minded people who have spent a lot of time figuring out ways to style long hair on men.

So, honestly, when I see guys with hair that long, or super long beards, etc, it tells me they are insecure. The extreme look is a way of masking themselves, and keeping others at arm\u2019s length (or hair\u2019s length, in your case\ud83d\ude09). I\u2019ve been there. My advice is go for a radical change. Go to a high end barber, and give them carte blanche to do anything they think looks good. I did that once and the next day at work was an amazing self confidence boost of people saying WOW YOU LOOK AWESOME!  Just do it, it will always grow back if you don\u2019t like it, but you will like it. Then for part 2, enlist the help of your most stylish female friend, or stylish gay friend. Take them  with you to go get new glasses. Sorry, but 1978 called and they want their glasses back. Those are just way too big for your face. Again, have that trusted friend and the person working at the store pick out your new glasses for you. Let them pick, just trust whatever they say and do it. \nI hope you take my advice, and I\u2019d love to see the results. Sorry if any of this sounded harsh, but I was in a similar situation just out of college, and doing this changed the direction of my life. And, I dare say you\u2019ll get a lot more interest from the ladies, or guys, or both. You\u2019ll be a happy man. Good luck!",

I have since went relatively short and I can attest to the single change of my hair has went from a couple of compliments from here and there to being hit on basically everytime I'm out and while it sounds vain it does make me feel a lot better about myself.

You have too much of it in the front and it's obscuring the shape of your face and the details. Try pulling some it back while having some in the front, and the left pic looked a bit better than the middle part. Maybe try getting a stylist to add some texture or layer it as well.\n\nR/fierceflow would have a lot of similar minded people who have spent a lot of time figuring out ways to style long hair on men. Keep it up my fellow long hair KING, and keep looking great, peace out",
