Sasuke attempted it and wasn't successful.

He burned himself in the process. Just so Fugaku would say \"as expected, you are my child\" with his back turned to him when he finally mastered it. \n\nSasuke left Sarada when she was a toddler, but he has shown her more affection  than his father did to him or Itachi which is messed up.",
