Stop sleeping on Hiruzen NO OTHER CHARACTER in the series does. Hiruzen had to develop that help you are talking about. It wasnt given to him...Hiruzen had to develop the village and make it real for generations and he did exactly that. Hell even Sasuke and Naruto were developed by him that's his bell test! Hiruzen assigned them to team 7. Hiruzen is the one who trained Jiriaya who then trains Naruto etc. etc. etc.",

If Madara was a Ferrari then Kaguya was an F1 with no wheels.\n\nAnd then they should\u2019ve killed off Guy. Killing Hiruzen is fine, killing Asuma is fine, killing Neji is fine, but killing Guy? After his epic performance using the gate of *death*. You know? The gate that results in death. But nah let\u2019s make Naruto Jesus while he\u2019s at it, just so we can keep Guy around. I like Guy, I want him around, but it\u2019s some deus ex machina to bring him back after we were told he would die.\n\nBasically if Kishi plans for the twist (Itachi) it\u2019s good, but if he asspulls the twist, it sucks.",

And it was stated that all Jinchuurikis were basically isolated from their villages and only seen as WoMD. If Hiruzen took care of Naruto like how everyone wants, he would have 0 impact on Gaara. His growth wouldn't be that impactful. Plus its a ninja world, their society and standards are different. And Hiruzen got other things to take care of. We see from Boruto how Naruto as Hokage barely got time for his family despite the villages being at peace. Hiruzen was probably just as busy during his reign, which is why he hired a personal trainer for Konohamoru instead of teaching him himself",

It was controversial to have Naruto roam around the village at all let alone train him and assign him to teams and missions. Hiruzen was in a tricky spot when it came to Naruto. The Hokage befriending the demon who killed their family and friends creates chaos. Fans easily say this is the 4ths son that's why he should but again they are dumb. Minato was very hated and had many enemies and his son would be a target. Hiruzen balanced the village's feelings and Naruto's development as best he could and it worked out amazingly.",

Maybe if he got the jutsu off quick enough Tobirama could not counter or perhaps he didn't think they had access to full power/jutsu. In the anime, his jutsu does hit and has 1st and 2nd hokages surrounded, so it is shocking that the 2nd is able to counter.\n\n\nI don't really think either is stupid. It's just for some reason the fanbase has decided that's it's funny to make fun of Kurenai. To me, each encounter is like apples to oranges. Really, I could say Kakashi was a dumbass for thinking he was more proficient with his sharingan than Itachi when he got caught in Tsukuyomi, but that's taboo bc everyone loves Kakashi",

If Madara was a Ferrari then Kaguya was an F1 with no wheels.\n\nAnd then they should\u2019ve killed off Guy. Killing Hiruzen is fine, killing Asuma is fine, killing Neji is fine, but killing Guy? After his epic performance using the gate of *death*. You know? The gate that results in death. But nah let\u2019s make Naruto Jesus while he\u2019s at it, just so we can keep Guy around. I like Guy, I want him around, but it\u2019s some deus ex machina to bring him back after we were told he would die.\n\nBasically if Kishi plans for the twist (Itachi) it\u2019s good, but if he asspulls the twist, it sucks.",

His growth wouldn't be that impactful. Plus its a ninja world, their society and standards are different. And Hiruzen got other things to take care of. We see from Boruto how Naruto as Hokage barely got time for his family despite the villages being at peace. Hiruzen was probably just as busy during his reign, which is why he hired a personal trainer for Konohamoru instead of teaching him himself",

He didn't hire him he made him feel for Naruto and form bonds with him *(demon fox who killed his parents)* that's not an easy talk no justsu...then Hiruzen put Naruto on Kakashi's team and asked Kakashi about the bell test to make sure Naruto forms bonds with that team. It was controversial to have Naruto roam around the village at all let alone train him and assign him to teams and missions. Hiruzen was in a tricky spot when it came to Naruto. The Hokage befriending the demon who killed their family and friends creates chaos. Fans easily say this is the 4ths son that's why he should but again they are dumb. Minato was very hated and had many enemies and his son would be a target. Hiruzen balanced the village's feelings and Naruto's development as best he could and it worked out amazingly.",

Also, Sarutobi used the Dragon Flame Bomb which isn't some basic bitch jutsu. Very few are known to be able to use it and is incredibly versatile/effective. \n\n\nHonestly, I agree that Kurenai thought maybe she could get the jump, and I think the same for the Hiruzen. Maybe if he got the jutsu off quick enough Tobirama could not counter or perhaps he didn't think they had access to full power/jutsu. In the anime, his jutsu does hit and has 1st and 2nd hokages surrounded, so it is shocking that the 2nd is able to counter.\n\n\nI don't really think either is stupid. It's just for some reason the fanbase has decided that's it's funny to make fun of Kurenai. To me, each encounter is like apples to oranges. Really, I could say Kakashi was a dumbass for thinking he was more proficient with his sharingan than Itachi when he got caught in Tsukuyomi, but that's taboo bc everyone loves Kakashi",

He couldn\u2019t figure out how they\u2019d beat Madara so he kills him off for an ostensibly stronger character out of nowhere; except she\u2019s got no abilities. If Madara was a Ferrari then Kaguya was an F1 with no wheels.\n\nAnd then they should\u2019ve killed off Guy. Killing Hiruzen is fine, killing Asuma is fine, killing Neji is fine, but killing Guy? After his epic performance using the gate of *death*. You know? The gate that results in death. But nah let\u2019s make Naruto Jesus while he\u2019s at it, just so we can keep Guy around. I like Guy, I want him around, but it\u2019s some deus ex machina to bring him back after we were told he would die.\n\nBasically if Kishi plans for the twist (Itachi) it\u2019s good, but if he asspulls the twist, it sucks.",

His growth wouldn't be that impactful. Plus its a ninja world, their society and standards are different. And Hiruzen got other things to take care of. We see from Boruto how Naruto as Hokage barely got time for his family despite the villages being at peace.

It was controversial to have Naruto roam around the village at all let alone train him and assign him to teams and missions. Hiruzen was in a tricky spot when it came to Naruto. The Hokage befriending the demon who killed their family and friends creates chaos. Fans easily say this is the 4ths son that's why he should but again they are dumb. Minato was very hated and had many enemies and his son would be a target. Hiruzen balanced the village's feelings and Naruto's development as best he could and it worked out amazingly.",

Maybe if he got the jutsu off quick enough Tobirama could not counter or perhaps he didn't think they had access to full power/jutsu. In the anime, his jutsu does hit and has 1st and 2nd hokages surrounded, so it is shocking that the 2nd is able to counter.\n\n\nI don't really think either is stupid. It's just for some reason the fanbase has decided that's it's funny to make fun of Kurenai. To me, each encounter is like apples to oranges. Really, I could say Kakashi was a dumbass for thinking he was more proficient with his sharingan than Itachi when he got caught in Tsukuyomi, but that's taboo bc everyone loves Kakashi",

Stop sleeping on Hiruzen NO OTHER CHARACTER in the series does. Hiruzen had to develop that help you are talking about. It wasnt given to him...Hiruzen had to develop the village and make it real for generations and he did exactly that. Hell even Sasuke and Naruto were developed by him that's his bell test! Hiruzen assigned them to team 7. Hiruzen is the one who trained Jiriaya who then trains Naruto etc. etc. etc.",

If Madara was a Ferrari then Kaguya was an F1 with no wheels.\n\nAnd then they should\u2019ve killed off Guy. Killing Hiruzen is fine, killing Asuma is fine, killing Neji is fine, but killing Guy? After his epic performance using the gate of *death*. You know? The gate that results in death. But nah let\u2019s make Naruto Jesus while he\u2019s at it, just so we can keep Guy around. I like Guy, I want him around, but it\u2019s some deus ex machina to bring him back after we were told he would die.\n\nBasically if Kishi plans for the twist (Itachi) it\u2019s good, but if he asspulls the twist, it sucks.",

His growth wouldn't be that impactful. Plus its a ninja world, their society and standards are different. And Hiruzen got other things to take care of. We see from Boruto how Naruto as Hokage barely got time for his family despite the villages being at peace.

It was controversial to have Naruto roam around the village at all let alone train him and assign him to teams and missions. Hiruzen was in a tricky spot when it came to Naruto. The Hokage befriending the demon who killed their family and friends creates chaos. Fans easily say this is the 4ths son that's why he should but again they are dumb. Minato was very hated and had many enemies and his son would be a target. Hiruzen balanced the village's feelings and Naruto's development as best he could and it worked out amazingly.",

If Madara was a Ferrari then Kaguya was an F1 with no wheels.\n\nAnd then they should\u2019ve killed off Guy. Killing Hiruzen is fine, killing Asuma is fine, killing Neji is fine, but killing Guy? After his epic performance using the gate of *death*. You know? The gate that results in death. But nah let\u2019s make Naruto Jesus while he\u2019s at it, just so we can keep Guy around. I like Guy, I want him around, but it\u2019s some deus ex machina to bring him back after we were told he would die.\n\nBasically if Kishi plans for the twist (Itachi) it\u2019s good, but if he asspulls the twist, it sucks.",

You got his backstory in detail, you get his motivation, and then he\u2019s killed off by sneak attack? To be replaced by a character that has much weaker  combat abilities?

And it was stated that all Jinchuurikis were basically isolated from their villages and only seen as WoMD. If Hiruzen took care of Naruto like how everyone wants, he would have 0 impact on Gaara. His growth wouldn't be that impactful. Plus its a ninja world, their society and standards are different. And Hiruzen got other things to take care of. We see from Boruto how Naruto as Hokage barely got time for his family despite the villages being at peace. Hiruzen was probably just as busy during his reign, which is why he hired a personal trainer for Konohamoru instead of teaching him himself",

If Madara was a Ferrari then Kaguya was an F1 with no wheels.\n\nAnd then they should\u2019ve killed off Guy. Killing Hiruzen is fine, killing Asuma is fine, killing Neji is fine, but killing Guy? After his epic performance using the gate of *death*. You know? The gate that results in death. But nah let\u2019s make Naruto Jesus while he\u2019s at it, just so we can keep Guy around. I like Guy, I want him around, but it\u2019s some deus ex machina to bring him back after we were told he would die.\n\nBasically if Kishi plans for the twist (Itachi) it\u2019s good, but if he asspulls the twist, it sucks.",

We don't know who or how we was looked after as an infant or anything other than he used to walk around town alone when he was like 8-ish",

He didn't hire him he made him feel for Naruto and form bonds with him *(demon fox who killed his parents)* that's not an easy talk no justsu...then Hiruzen put Naruto on Kakashi's team and asked Kakashi about the bell test to make sure Naruto forms bonds with that team. It was controversial to have Naruto roam around the village at all let alone train him and assign him to teams and missions. Hiruzen was in a tricky spot when it came to Naruto. The Hokage befriending the demon who killed their family and friends creates chaos. Fans easily say this is the 4ths son that's why he should but again they are dumb. Minato was very hated and had many enemies and his son would be a target. Hiruzen balanced the village's feelings and Naruto's development as best he could and it worked out amazingly.",

Considering Kishi wrote Pain with his crazy abilities, the war with all the different ninja. Madara with his endless ability. Kaguya hopped dimensions, shot hair, and had some basic elemental control. \n\nMadara was the fight, and he was so strong, the whole series was resting on how they are going to beat this guy who has an answer to everything and hits back 10x as hard. You got his backstory in detail, you get his motivation, and then he\u2019s killed off by sneak attack? To be replaced by a character that has much weaker  combat abilities? It deadass felt like he couldn\u2019t figure out how to have them beat Madara because of how strong he had developed him over so long, that he just decided to kill him off and give them another villain to fight.",
