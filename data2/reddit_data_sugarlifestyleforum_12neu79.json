    "body": "Hello fellow sugar people! Long time lurker here. I've enjoyed reading about your experiences in the bowl but was hesitant to share my own because they were never quite as entertaining. Until recently!\n\nSo I guess it was only a matter of time before I had my own strange M&G story. Beautiful girl who works in a similar profession as me. No red flags that I see prior to our M&G. Her profile says she's single and got no kids.\n\nSo when we meet, one of the first things she says to me is that she's recently divorced. Which is fine, that still counts as single. Then she tells me she's locked in a custody dispute over the kid. Kid wouldn't be a deal breaker for me but it wasn't in her profile so that's at least a yellow flag. Then again, she's been on Seeking for a few years now and the kid is young, so maybe she just forgot to update it.\n\nThen she tells me she had to leave her husband because of a DV situation. I feel terrible for her and am really sympathetic, and tell her it's good she got out of that relationship. Her response is that she's not out of the woods yet because the divorce isn't finalized.\n\nAt this point I can't reconcile \"recently divorced\" with \"not yet finalized.\" I'm starting to sense that I'm dealing with someone who's not being entirely honest. There were other little things too that were inconsistent but these were the big ones.\n\nMaybe sensing that I'm losing interest, she excuses herself and goes to the restroom. When she comes back she sits on my side of the booth and starts making out with me, tongue and everything. Which I gotta say is kinda nice. She's a good kisser.\n\nThen she sticks her hands down my pants and starts stroking me. Which also feels really good, so I stupidly let this go on for a little while. Until she starts unzipping my pants.\n\nI have no idea if she's seriously intending to whip my dick out in the middle of the restaurant but I'm not about to find out and get arrested for indecent exposure. So I gently remove her hands, tell her I was uncomfortable, and ask her to sit back across from me.\n\nRest of the M&G was awkward but relatively uneventful after that. She asks when we're going to see each other again so I tell her I'll check my schedule, but I give her a little gift before she gets into the Uber because I feel bad about the kid and marital situation, assuming it's true.\n\nWhen I get home I politely inform her that I don't feel we're a good match, wish her well, and block. Then I finish the job that she started.",

I did exactly what you described while dating during my divorce. When a woman says, \"I'm in the process of a divorce\", there's too much we might be asked to divulge that isn't anyone else's business unless and until we're securely in an arrangement down the line. Even then it's a discretionary mattet. Overall, this woman was impressively honest and straightforward with you and I think you're hypercritical honestly. \n\nEager single mother wrapping a stressful divorce - is into exhibitionism and has a little financial pain to be eased..... you really dropped the ball on this one.",

Typically when children and/or significant, jointly-held assets are involved it can be quite complicated - even for no-fault divorces.\n\nOne of the most important things about filing a petition is that it sets a clear date between jointly-held and singly-held property. If POT SB filed for petition and won the lottery or got a huge gift from SD, that would not be considered communal property, even though the divorce is not finalized.",

There are too many creeps out there who groom women to get to their children and it's standard sugar practice to only share in person if/when comfortable unless asked point blank beforehand. \n\nAnd 2. \"Recently divorced\" is something women generally tend to say regardless of where we are in the divorce. I did exactly what you described while dating during my divorce. When a woman says, \"I'm in the process of a divorce\", there's too much we might be asked to divulge that isn't anyone else's business unless and until we're securely in an arrangement down the line. Even then it's a discretionary mattet. Overall, this woman was impressively honest and straightforward with you and I think you're hypercritical honestly. \n\nEager single mother wrapping a stressful divorce - is into exhibitionism and has a little financial pain to be eased..... you really dropped the ball on this one.",

There are too many creeps out there who groom women to get to their children and it's standard sugar practice to only share in person if/when comfortable unless asked point blank beforehand. \n\nAnd 2. \"Recently divorced\" is something women generally tend to say regardless of where we are in the divorce. I did exactly what you described while dating during my divorce. When a woman says, \"I'm in the process of a divorce\", there's too much we might be asked to divulge that isn't anyone else's business unless and until we're securely in an arrangement down the line. Even then it's a discretionary mattet. Overall, this woman was impressively honest and straightforward with you and I think you're hypercritical honestly. \n\nEager single mother wrapping a stressful divorce - is into exhibitionism and has a little financial pain to be eased..... you really dropped the ball on this one.",
