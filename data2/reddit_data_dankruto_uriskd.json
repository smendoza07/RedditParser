Yes, it depends on how well you learn from your mistakes. Like i said, its not just doing it 500 times. Its doing it 500 times and making adjustments based on your results. Ofcourse, if you just keep running at a problem with no thought to whats happening you're not going to really improve. Actually, muscle memory is also a thing so that could work too for physical skills. Anyway, its been an interesting convo but I'm done. Have a good one.",

So, even if a fighter doesn't have a coach, they can still learn a lot from the other player.\n\nNaruto's in a unique situation where he *is* all players. It's incredibly hard to recognize what you're doing wrong without the help of other people.\n\nWithout *any* form of guidance, Naruto may actually get worse -- and instill bad habits over the hours that he plays.\n\nWhen I mentioned elite athletes, it's b/c the original commenter on this thread had said that Naruto could take 500 hours to become the best player. I thought you were commenting in support of that statement.",
