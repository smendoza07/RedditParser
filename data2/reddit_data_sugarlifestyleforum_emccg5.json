    "body": "I went out with my SD who I was just starting to get to know. It was our 2nd time out. I enjoyed spending time with him so I accepted a ppm lower than I feel comfortable with to start, with plans to negotiate later. He asked if I wanted to have dinner Saturday night so I rally even though I'm busy. We go out to dinner and have drinks with a few of his friends in a few different locations/clubs. At 2 am I thought he was taking me home, but he wasn't. He was taking me to his house 25 miles away! By the time I noticed I was so far from my house and was so tired and just wanted to go to sleep. We get to his place and I'm kind of getting ready for bed.. brushing my teeth etc. And as soon as I'm going to sleep and (I presume he notices that hes not going to get laid) he starts making insulting comments about my body. I just said \"what is wrong with you???\" And pulled the covers over my head, but he kept going on saying crazy shit so I got up, got redressed and called an uber. He immediately started apologizing.  DONT LEAVE ME I MADE A MISTAKE AHHHH. Whatever. I made it home at literally 4am crying. He didnt pay me. \nI accept fault for being negligent. There are a lot of points in the story where I could have took more control, but I was kind of in a vulnerable place that night and I trusted him more than I should. God forbid someone actually behave as they claim to intend for once? \nBummed I wasted my time and traumatized myself. \nThis is my first SD experience. \nAnyways just wanted to share. Have a good day <3",

Most wouldn't, you did, thanks for sharing the story.\n\nBTW, kinda weird that he had you meet friends that early - not sure if there was a reason for that, but that would almost never happen in a normal SR. For reference, my SB has met two family members but it was totally incidental (we just happened to be at a certain event same time to met up) and we had been together for like 9 months. No SB has ever met any friends of mine.\n\nAnd seems obvious he was pouring tons of drinks to get you wasted so he could pull off the \"oh, we're at my place\" trick.\n\nAgain, good job making the right move, love hearing when that happens!",

His behavior is that of an abuser and he likely feels even more entitled to do that to you if you\u2019re being compensated for your time. That all being said, none of this is your fault. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s job to be a decent human being without being forced or manipulated into it. But because of the way humans and the world is, we have to protect ourselves and be ahead of the game when doing these things with men.

Also why I never wanted to date Giselle, she's shallow and just likes famous football players. etc.\n\nIf there's a trend, probably comes out of the PUA neg culture, but I don't really think so.",

After he sends the money (CashApp, etc.), BLOCK. On every site and on your phone (even if you're using a fake number \\[which you hopefully are\\]), BLOCK.\n\nNow, I, of course, don't usually condone anyone baiting for payment and/or blocking after receiving a payment, but this guy owes you what you earned and is obviously a piece of trash. This is one of the few cases I think it's deserved.\n\n\\---\n\nIn the future, as others have said, always control your transportation; a good SD not only would be completely understanding of that, but any SD worth his weight in sugar will give you the money/compensate for the costs of transportation.\n\nAlso, you mentioned you thought he was taking you home? In the future, never give anyone, especially someone you just met, your home/work address. If anything, such as when they're paying for an Uber on their account, use a public place for pick-ups and drop-offs (e.g., gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. esp. ones you don't frequent often). That way if they end up batshit you don't have to worry about them knowing where you live and work and frequent.\n\nFinally, make sure to tell at least one person what you're doing, who you're with, where you're going, and what time they should expect for you to let them know you're home. Share your location with them (SnapMap, FindMyFriends, etc.)!!!  It can be embarrassing to admit, I know, but *someone* needs to know, whether it's a best friend or someone else you trust in your normal life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake some time to self-care and relax, and maybe talk to your/a therapist if you can (usually colleges/universities offer \"free\" \\[paid with tuition\\] counseling services --  use them to your advantage, esp. while in the sugaring and everyday world!). This was pretty traumatizing, or at least it would be for me, so it's best to make sure you're mentally ready before continuing with any further pursuits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe live and we learn and now you're smarter and wiser for this and know what to do for the future. Glad you're safe!",

I know this to be fact.\n\nAnyone can act and pretend to be a great guy, perfect, etc. I personally try as hard as I can not to be a jackass, bad guy, asshole, etc. and am always low-pressure and go with the flow. I try not to overstep boundaries that may or may not be there and can be very patient. Never would I want anyone to feel uncomfortable with me or to assume that I can do something or take someone somewhere without total certainty that it is okay.\n\nI am sorry about your situation and that it was your first experience. As a male, I've been lied to, ghosted, catfished, rinsed, scammed and even made uncomfortable a time or two. I've also met some very cool people and had some great times and made a few friends who are still friends even though maybe the SD/SB relationship isn't in play. And I've been burned - badly and recently. Still kinda getting over one situation.\n\nI can tell you there are really bad people on that site and really good people - and some people who may qualify as neither but are there just there to have something to do and maybe feel like they are in the chase, but not really serious about the actual pursuit. And as much as I try to be a gentleman, good person, nice guy, etc. as with any dating site or hookup situation or any relationship, I'm sure there are a few out there who think I'm a jerk or didn't handle a situation correctly or whatever. I get that. We aren't perfect and sometimes we make mistakes, but at the end of the day if the intentions are good and you haven't violated someone's trust, made them uncomfortable, purposely been deceitful, etc. ... mistakes are acceptable in life. Apologize, move on, and realize that you have have burned a bridge and leave that person alone unless they reach back out to you.\n\nGood, well-meaning people are out there. They aren't easy to find. Be patient. Be careful. Don't feel bad about your situation. It's happened to most of us at some level. If you don't expect perfection, be willing to compromise and meet halfway on some things and proceed with caution you should be able to have some good times and meet some folks who can help you out.\n\nI'm not currently on the site, but don't call me a hypocrite. I left it as a show of good faith to someone I met who apparently didn't return that to me. Oh well. Live and learn. Good  luck!",

That is not \"sort of normal\" behavior, it's shitty behavior.  Speaking as a guy here.  I've been told \"no\" before when I expected \"yes\" and I never flipped out.\n\nThird, on what basis are you trivializing how upsetting this was?  Late at night, his house, he wanted sex, and he's insulting/bullying her.  That could be a scary event which would explain why she was literally left in tears.\n\nThat's not to say she couldn't have protected herself better, but why you decided to go out on a limb defending this creep is beyond me.",

People agree to PPMs or allowance often before the M&G. It\u2019s not the same as consent.\n\nConsent means when one adult actively agrees to have sex with another adult. Setting a PPM is not doing that. Now let\u2019s move on to the subject of rape, since you are having trouble understanding basic ass definitions. You can be charged with rape if you do not receive AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. Any coercion or pressure can classify the sexual actions proceeding as rape. So the fact that he drove her to his home without permission and pressured her to engage in a sexual act is one stones throw away from sexual assault. \n\nStop taking notes from Kevin Spacey, it\u2019s not a good look.",

Most wouldn't, you did, thanks for sharing the story.\n\nBTW, kinda weird that he had you meet friends that early - not sure if there was a reason for that, but that would almost never happen in a normal SR. For reference, my SB has met two family members but it was totally incidental (we just happened to be at a certain event same time to met up) and we had been together for like 9 months. No SB has ever met any friends of mine.\n\nAnd seems obvious he was pouring tons of drinks to get you wasted so he could pull off the \"oh, we're at my place\" trick.\n\nAgain, good job making the right move, love hearing when that happens!",

That is not \"sort of normal\" behavior, it's shitty behavior.  Speaking as a guy here.  I've been told \"no\" before when I expected \"yes\" and I never flipped out.\n\nThird, on what basis are you trivializing how upsetting this was?  Late at night, his house, he wanted sex, and he's insulting/bullying her.  That could be a scary event which would explain why she was literally left in tears.\n\nThat's not to say she couldn't have protected herself better, but why you decided to go out on a limb defending this creep is beyond me.",

Now let\u2019s move on to the subject of rape, since you are having trouble understanding basic ass definitions. You can be charged with rape if you do not receive AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. Any coercion or pressure can classify the sexual actions proceeding as rape. So the fact that he drove her to his home without permission and pressured her to engage in a sexual act is one stones throw away from sexual assault. \n\nStop taking notes from Kevin Spacey, it\u2019s not a good look.",

For reference, my SB has met two family members but it was totally incidental (we just happened to be at a certain event same time to met up) and we had been together for like 9 months. No SB has ever met any friends of mine.\n\nAnd seems obvious he was pouring tons of drinks to get you wasted so he could pull off the \"oh, we're at my place\" trick.\n\nAgain, good job making the right move, love hearing when that happens!",
