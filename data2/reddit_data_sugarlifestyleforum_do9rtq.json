    "body": "So, my sister named her hyperactive dog, and it's my safe word. Saturday, I'm sitting around a dinner table with my whole family, while my sister keeps screaming my safe word. Do you know how much wine you have to drink to erase that image? Well, I don't know either, but I'm pretty sure the answer is \"all of it.\"\n#\nI sent a text to my SB that said \"hey, we have to change our safe word because my sister keeps using it.\"  I realize now that seems creepy, but don't worry folks. I never actually sent that message to my SB.... because I accidentally sent it to my mom instead.  Fun fact: turns out my mom is the only person in my family who doesn't know what a safe word is. I know this, because she asked the whole table what my text meant. My 85 year old grandma explained it to her, and then winked at me and asked if I had a \"secret girlfriend or boyfriend.\"  That's right boys. My grandma thinks my game is so bad, that no one knows whether I am trying to attract a man or a woman. Fuck you me-maw! They didn't have tinder in the jurassic era, when you were dating. I can rarely club some chick and drag her by her hair back to my cave. I have to actually look good, thanks to fucking millennials.\n#\nAfter a lot of inappropriate judging of my safe word, my 12 year old niece asks me why I need a safe word. Well boys, drunk tasty is a very honest person, so I answered her.  \"When two people love each other very much, they show that love by hugging. Sometimes, a hug gets so passionate, that it helps to have a word you can use before someone gets choked out. I need a safe word because, well, I give the best hugs.\"  During the 8 seconds of horrified silence that followed, I looked me-maw right in the eye, so she knew her boy had that big dick energy. It works out well for me, because it's unlikely that she knows which websites have videos of my penis.\n#\nNow I have to tell my sbs that I am changing my safe word. Unfortunately, I have told them a lot of incest jokes. Like, a lot. So I can't tell them the real reason. Any ideas for a cover story?",
