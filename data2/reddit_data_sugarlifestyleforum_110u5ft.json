I was using a shortened version of my first name and he was using a (fake) common first name. On our second date he asked what my name was short for and I told him, and after acknowledging that it was my real first name, i playfully called him out on his clearly fake alias. So it was out in the open. But ultimately, I was confident enough in my assessment of the situation, and his character, to build trust organically and wait for him to share that information when he was ready. \n\nThen, of course, after I started spiraling a bit and thought he\u2019d ghosted me, I no longer felt that my trust was being respected, so I took matters into my own hands. \n\nI won\u2019t excuse his lack of responsiveness, especially during the early, vulnerable stages of an SR, but i will say that the added surrounding context that he shared with me afterwards was completely reasonable, and I do not have any suspicions that he intentionally or maliciously withheld communications with me. \n\nAlso this wasn\u2019t a vday gift, just a regular gift ;)",

Even with the free acct, I was able to save one of the low-res images from their results, and then i reverse image searched that in Google (which I couldn\u2019t have done with the original photo I had of him, because that one hadn\u2019t been uploaded anywhere before. He was smart\u2026just not smart enough :p) and got a direct link to the original source, which revealed his name/company",

Although some of the webscrapers aren\u2019t accurate about marriage status I found and that\u2019s terrible for the men especially! Anyway your web skills give me hope for the younger generations! I wonder whether those sites could be sued for libel or defamation? I\u2019m not litigious myself but more like a \u201ccease and desist\u201d if you can\u2019t verify type of action. Also glad you had a sense of humor and you guys are okay!",

For SD's especially, anonymity is extremely important. Although as an arrangement progresses, both parties will probably reveal their true identities after some trust is built, it will scare the shit out of most SD's right at the beginning because they're then thinking is she setting me up to be blackmailed. If I knew a SB's identity, I would keep it to myself until she was ready to tell me and not let her know that I already knew it.",

I can say with near certainty that my SD knows that I would never blackmail him, and i say this because we\u2019ve had lengthy conversations about my prior arrangements. One of which (i wrote about in a post here previously) blurred into my vanilla dating life, ultimately destroying a potentially great relationship solely because my commitment to discretion with a former SD\u2014despite that SD being incredibly disrespectful and unkind to me\u2014made it impossible for me to cultivate a healthy, honest relationship with someone who knew him.

For example, it's an automatic rejection if she has kids or is married. Men risk having to pay child support, just for dating a single Mom who has kids by another man, and I've also caught 2 past POTs lying about not being married.\n\nSo they can obviously do the same thing to me. Which horrifies them sometimes (i.e. political views, views on current controversial medical topics, etc), and then they ghost/reject me.  \n\nFull transparency is best for both parties. I have way too much to lose as a public figure, and need to be hyper-vigilant about 'risk management' ... if the POT SB won't give me her real identity information, it's a no-go.",

I was using a shortened version of my first name and he was using a (fake) common first name. On our second date he asked what my name was short for and I told him, and after acknowledging that it was my real first name, i playfully called him out on his clearly fake alias. So it was out in the open. But ultimately, I was confident enough in my assessment of the situation, and his character, to build trust organically and wait for him to share that information when he was ready. \n\nThen, of course, after I started spiraling a bit and thought he\u2019d ghosted me, I no longer felt that my trust was being respected, so I took matters into my own hands. \n\nI won\u2019t excuse his lack of responsiveness, especially during the early, vulnerable stages of an SR, but i will say that the added surrounding context that he shared with me afterwards was completely reasonable, and I do not have any suspicions that he intentionally or maliciously withheld communications with me. \n\nAlso this wasn\u2019t a vday gift, just a regular gift ;)",

I was using a shortened version of my first name and he was using a (fake) common first name. On our second date he asked what my name was short for and I told him, and after acknowledging that it was my real first name, i playfully called him out on his clearly fake alias. So it was out in the open. But ultimately, I was confident enough in my assessment of the situation, and his character, to build trust organically and wait for him to share that information when he was ready. \n\nThen, of course, after I started spiraling a bit and thought he\u2019d ghosted me, I no longer felt that my trust was being respected, so I took matters into my own hands. \n\nI won\u2019t excuse his lack of responsiveness, especially during the early, vulnerable stages of an SR, but i will say that the added surrounding context that he shared with me afterwards was completely reasonable, and I do not have any suspicions that he intentionally or maliciously withheld communications with me. \n\nAlso this wasn\u2019t a vday gift, just a regular gift ;)",

On our second date he asked what my name was short for and I told him, and after acknowledging that it was my real first name, i playfully called him out on his clearly fake alias. So it was out in the open. But ultimately, I was confident enough in my assessment of the situation, and his character, to build trust organically and wait for him to share that information when he was ready. \n\nThen, of course, after I started spiraling a bit and thought he\u2019d ghosted me, I no longer felt that my trust was being respected, so I took matters into my own hands. \n\nI won\u2019t excuse his lack of responsiveness, especially during the early, vulnerable stages of an SR, but i will say that the added surrounding context that he shared with me afterwards was completely reasonable, and I do not have any suspicions that he intentionally or maliciously withheld communications with me. \n\nAlso this wasn\u2019t a vday gift, just a regular gift ;)",
