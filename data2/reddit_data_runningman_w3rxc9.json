People occasionally report delivery orders being delayed and phone calls jammed after those PPLs air.\n\nEven when its not even a PPL, when they do missions where they eat some delicious food, they find people order related stuff when they air.\n\nReason why we're seeing more Food related PPLs then others (phones, TVs, LED Masks etc)\n\nKinda feeling envious on people living in Seoul where they can watch them eat stuff on air, then have luxury of picking up a phone/app and order something they're eating on the spot.",
