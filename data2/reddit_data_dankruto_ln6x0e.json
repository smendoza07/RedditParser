Also don't forget that sharingan just makes you op af. Lee developed those moves, while Sasuke copied already existing work and just trained his body to physically be able to repeat after him. Sharingan is like this cheat that makes you be able to bypass the technique aspect of a craft, while that is 90% of a mastership imho. So just as soon as his body was able to keep up he can instantly do it.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Also don't forget that sharingan just makes you op af. Lee developed those moves, while Sasuke copied already existing work and just trained his body to physically be able to repeat after him. Sharingan is like this cheat that makes you be able to bypass the technique aspect of a craft, while that is 90% of a mastership imho. So just as soon as his body was able to keep up he can instantly do it.\n\nEdit: grammar",
