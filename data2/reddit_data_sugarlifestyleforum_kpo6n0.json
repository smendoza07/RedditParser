    "body": "It pains me when I see SDs treating sugar like other business deals.  SBs are not chattel.  SDs have unfair bargaining power and experience so its not a fair fight.  \n\nJust treat your SBs like the beautiful souls they are, full of idealism, hopes, dreams. Be generous!  It mystifies me that so many SDs don't realize generosity returns in kind and then some.  News flash- A lot of money is a big turn on for SBs and will be rewarded in ways you didn't realize possible.\n\nWhat is your risk?  You spend a bit more on someone and then move on, so what?  What is her risk?  She gets scammed and loses money or worse.  Legit SDs can easily absorb losses and learn from the experience!  Most SBs have little room for loss. Make them feel comfortable by talking about the allowance early, using terms of engagement to limit intimacy until she is ready for the full monty.  You will open yourself up to a broader array of potential SBs and enrich your life greatly.",

With that foundation they were (for the most part) Relationships/ Arrangements  with a capital R. \n\nThe two major forces for unfortunate change have been (in my opinion) the far greater promotion of arrangements as a source of instant income for SB and the growth of a cottage industry of sites extolling the opportunities to deceive and abuse. \n\nToo often young women, just entering the world of arrangements, are pushed or jump into sex without completing an adequate screening/ introductory process or following the fundamentals. \n\nFor someone new my recommendation is to have a minimum of two platonic meetings and then follow the essential procedures. \n\nIn some ways it is like a football player, race car driver, pilot, shooter or golfer. If your performance is off the best way forward is usually stepping back to the fundamentals.",

I saw a girl over Christmas that started our arrangement 8 years ago.  I build deep and long lasting friendships with many of my SB\u2019s... but it doesn\u2019t start like that.   It starts as an understanding of what the mutually beneficial arrangement will look like.  You both do your part for several months and earn trust over time.  You are wise to keep your guard up for awhile and expect them to keep it up as well.  When trust is built you can become true friends and come clean about all the silly lies you have told in the beginning to maintain privacy.  I have seen it go really bad when you get too friendly and close and intertwined too fast.  They will share info and get closer when they are ready...  just have fun while protecting your heart and bank account.",

I don't like at it as I give you this, and you give me that.\n\nI want to built a relationship where I'm getting what I want/need out of it, and she's getting what she wants/needs out of it.  However, my needs and wants are not just sex.   I'm looking for a genuine connection, and I'm looking for non-sexual intimacy and affection as well.  \n\nIt's incredibly important that there is a mutual trust, and part of establishing this trust is showing that I can hold up my part of the agreement and provide for her.    \n\nI feel that I'm pretty good at reading people, and identifying when someone is looking for someone long term and real, and when someone is just looking to scam/rinse/take-the-money-and-run.\n\nI will not continue down the path with someone unless I am legitimately enjoying their company, and I feel that we are building a connection, and we are heading towards the point of truly wanting to be intimate with one another.\n\nIf for some reason, I happen to mis-read a person, and they do bail on me after a few non-intimate (yet still very enjoyable) dates, or even worse, we find out we are completely sexually non-compatible, then what have I lost?   I've invested some time and money in someone that I care (or cared about).  Maybe my pride will be hurt a little bit, but I can bounce back from that pretty quickly.  \n\nFor her, I honestly think the stakes are a lot higher.  I can't imagine how I'd feel to invest myself in someone to find out they just wanted a one night stand, and were leading me on about their desire for a legitimate relationship.  I'd feel horribly used and dirty.  \n\nI am generous from the very beginning when I find someone that I want to invest it.  My generosity is not tied to intimacy -- although that's an important part of the relationship for me, so as long as we've had the conversation and that's something we are both looking for before too long, then I'm going to take that leap of faith.\n\nI prefer to invest in a relationship, and invest in a person.   As I said, I feel that I'm pretty good at reading people.  By no means am I advising that someone new at this should just start handing money to every POT and hope for the best, but that's what works very well for me.\n\nSorry for the long read if you are still reading.",

Honestly, I enjoy the messaging, getting to know people through chatting a little but, so I was not in a rush at all.   I was just enjoying the process.    By doing that and not forcing anything,  I happened to find exactly what I was looking for.   \nI am sure a lot of SDs are impatient, and a lot of SBs are also here because they need money, and aren't really interested on a real relationship with feelings amd all that.  Hang in there, be patient, and I'm sure you'll find someone the needle in the haystack.  \nIt is encouraging to be that I've seen a few other people post on here that gave the same thoughts amd feelings that I do.   \nI wish you the best of luck, and again, thanks for the compliment.  \nIf you ever want to chat, feel free to drop me a PM, inalways love having friends to talk to, since I can't talk about sugar with my real life circle of friends.",

But knowing your posting history (from prior userids), and the solicitation you've engaged in with women on SLF over DMs, it's hard to think otherwise.  \n\nAnyway, your post is a bit contradictory (even if it does sound nice and warm, happy, and inspirational at the start).\n\n> Legit SDs can easily absorb losses and learn from the experience! \n\nYou understand that that's typically what being business savy is?  Learning from mistakes, losses (including OTHER peoples mistakes and errors, if you can) - and then applying that going forward.\n\nAnd if we want to get further technical - a \"savvy\" businessman knows it's not just about the agreement, but the satisfaction part on both sides. So the goal is rarely ever to negotiate the absolute minimium - unless you don't see it as an ongoing relationship.\n\nAt which point, you are talking about (in the bowl) a bad actor anyway;  and your post is somewhat useless.",

You have a lot of new girls being heavily coached by savvy semi pros.  Being trusting is a bad idea.  \n\n\nI\u2019ve done this a long time and have had dozens of very successful, long term arrangements.  I saw a girl over Christmas that started our arrangement 8 years ago.  I build deep and long lasting friendships with many of my SB\u2019s... but it doesn\u2019t start like that.   It starts as an understanding of what the mutually beneficial arrangement will look like.  You both do your part for several months and earn trust over time.  You are wise to keep your guard up for awhile and expect them to keep it up as well.  When trust is built you can become true friends and come clean about all the silly lies you have told in the beginning to maintain privacy.  I have seen it go really bad when you get too friendly and close and intertwined too fast.  They will share info and get closer when they are ready...  just have fun while protecting your heart and bank account.",

By doing that and not forcing anything,  I happened to find exactly what I was looking for.   \nI am sure a lot of SDs are impatient, and a lot of SBs are also here because they need money, and aren't really interested on a real relationship with feelings amd all that.  Hang in there, be patient, and I'm sure you'll find someone the needle in the haystack.  \nIt is encouraging to be that I've seen a few other people post on here that gave the same thoughts amd feelings that I do.   \nI wish you the best of luck, and again, thanks for the compliment.  \nIf you ever want to chat, feel free to drop me a PM, inalways love having friends to talk to, since I can't talk about sugar with my real life circle of friends.",
