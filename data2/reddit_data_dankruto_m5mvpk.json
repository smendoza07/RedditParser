Advertising that Kushina was due to give birth and therefore her seal would be weakened to a dangerous point would\u2019ve completely defeated the purpose. Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary. All the precautions possible were taken to prevent the Kyubi from even making it to the village unless something ridiculously catastrophic happened, like Obito returning from the dead with a Mangekyo Sharingan and advanced knowledge of seals.",

Was Naruto born with the tailed beast or was it given to him? \n\n>But the only boy in the village with whiskers and animal characteristic when angry would be a safe assumption to say he's the Tailed beast's host. \n\n\nLike they were no ninjas born with weird characteristics in the entire village that his alone would standout; for example Torune was covered in poisonous beetles, Orochimaru was dead white.\n\n>The village know Kurama wasn't killed and any higher up like the Third or any anbu would know it was sealed, there is nothing to say they didn't reveal or spread rumors. I mean how else does the village in Part 1 know?\n\nThe same village that never knew he was Minato's son, for all they could know Kushina and her child died during the kyuubi accident while giving birth, only the Fourth was shown battling the kyuubi in the village. So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

And once again they obviously SOMEHOW knew, Naruto didn't even know until he was told but if a chunin like Mizuki knew his origins then it must've been amazingly obvious.\n\nAnd we don't know if they knew Naruto was Minato's or not, and even if they did why would they care? He's the host of a \"demon\".\n\nAlso from my understanding the Uzumaki were always host to the demon fox, and since Naruto is always screaming his name.

Naruto was already born with that facial mark before the sealing so that's not a valid point at all, after all his son had it too and didn't have kurama in him.

Obviously he'd have to disclose the info about this event to the Elders and Danzo and some other elite ninjas in his briefing of the village higher-up. His anbu of course won't rat. So for this to be common news in the village was devastating on his record. \n\nIt could've put both Naruto and the entire village in jeopardy, Orochimaru could've capitalised on it to have his revenge on the village and would've succeeded if not for scripting.\n\n>1: Kushina was the only Uzumaki in the village 2: Kushina was married to Minato 3:Some and I say some people knew she was pregnant, most didn't though\n\nAnd everyone knew Kushina was pregnant, she's the Hokage's wife my good friend.

                                                            "body": "Nobody is saying Fugaku acted perfectly; we're saying that Hiruzen's attempts at diplomacy were laughable. Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems. Uchiha higherups are as evil as Danzo.",

Also the genocide didn't happen on his orders danzo ordered itachi to do it  behind his back while hiruzen was still looking for a solution.

And while most villagers hated Naruto, I don't think most of the parents of Konoha 12 (minus Hinata's dad) hated him, as we saw how Shikamaru and Choji would play with Naruto at the park, and the other kids didn't show resentment to Naruto, as they didn't even know what was inside him.

Back in that time isnt even comparable to how life is for children now. Each and every one pampered, treated like little kings and queens, so on so forth. Life was hard. Life was DURING a war. Hiruzen did what he could and didnt do with Asuma to further his bloodline and keep the village alive. It wasnt perfect, as no one is and ever will be, but thats fine. Adds to the realism.",

Yes the 3rd let him do what he wanted, but so did everyone else. No one really cared about what he did until Sasuke learned about his involvement in the massacre.

From our point of view it may seem pretty obvious, but that\u2019s just because we know all the details.\n\nHaving Uzumaki as a last name isn\u2019t really telling, because it\u2019s a leaf tradition for the jinchuriki\u2019s to be Uzumakis. They\u2019re really the only ones who can handle having the 9tails chakra sealed. Kushina wasn\u2019t Mitos granddaughter or daughter, but they belonged to the same clan, and looked similar. And Uzumakis can also technically be blonde if theyre not fully Uzumaki. (Tsuandes 1/4th Uzumaki, granddaughter of Mito). \n\n[uzumaki tradition](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uBPVCCMTjLU/Xvi1P-uKpXI/AAAAAAABM1Y/PUw-hfOnTRYkWKJP-N1ISdwEhmlZx-gAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/004.jpg)\n\n\nPlus, the circumstances of Kushinas birth were mostly kept secret. There may have been some that knew, but coupled with the fact that talking about the 9tails incident is forbidden, it makes sense it\u2019s not common knowledge among the villagers.\n\n[Kushina secret](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qiLTJzNLKu4/Xvi1QHM6omI/AAAAAAABM1c/SSI6ysZf31MLZyg2FKlAca9_ria1RnEMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/005.jpg)\n\n[Secret birth](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ifKXJRXd_YQ/Xvi1RyAECII/AAAAAAABM10/ttL2jPruRW4W9spgH9aZ4Ay2obx6BW6dACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/011.jpg)\n\n\nI don\u2019t really think Gaara being regarded as \u201croyalty\u201d did anything for him. It was in title only, and the villagers still feared and viewed him in disgust. Such is life as a jinchuriki I guess. \n\n\nAs for the history being taught at schools, yeah they likely don\u2019t teach anything relating to the circumstances behind the incident because it\u2019s top secret",

At worst under Tobirama people were all like \"Fuck the Police\" towards the uchiha which doesn't really make sense considering how the ninja world is supposed to be strict and hold rules in high regard.",

All of these things were unnecessary af and were just meant to set him up as the villain for the final fight between him and naruto",

It's why Hinata got forced into being a shinobi meant to serve the clan, Shikadai gets pressured from some clan elder to be a politician, and Ino runs her parents flower shop.",

The Uchiha massacre could have been avoided, yes, but Danzo was always going behind his back and screwing everything up, and the village elders also wanted the Uchiha massacre, so he was in the minority. Also, about Naruto's upbringing, I guess he could have taken better care of Naruto, but he is also the Hokage. He is arguably the busiest person in the village. Even he didn't pay enough attention to his own grandson with how busy he was, and it's not like Tsunade seemed to have all the time in the world. She was always busy. Also, revealing the secret that Minato was his father to the public would not have changed the mistreatment he experience growing up. Just look at Gaara. He was also hated by his entire village for the same reason, and everyone knew that he was the son of the Kazekage. Another example is Killer Bee, who was also hated by his respective village, but he is more of an exception in the sense that he didn't care about other people's opinion. \n\nYes the meme is funny, but I just get irritated when I go to the comment section and see all this hate directed towards him when he, arguably, did his best in the situation he was in.",

Advertising that Kushina was due to give birth and therefore her seal would be weakened to a dangerous point would\u2019ve completely defeated the purpose. Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary.

So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

                                                    "body": "Nobody is saying Fugaku acted perfectly; we're saying that Hiruzen's attempts at diplomacy were laughable. Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

The entire council is people that Tobirama taught or in Danzo's case, led and the Uchiha ended up under close surveillance in a single place in the village\n\n>It's his fault Uchiha were massacred as his pawn Obito, framed the Uchiha for Kyuubi's attack.\n\nHe didn't frame the Uchiha. The council just immediately assumed it was them despite the fact there was zero reason to assume outside appearence.\n\n>Uchiha are whiny power hungry fools who brought it on themselves.\n\nExcept they literally didn't do shit to the village and have only been loyal only to be spit on in return.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems.

From our point of view it may seem pretty obvious, but that\u2019s just because we know all the details.\n\nHaving Uzumaki as a last name isn\u2019t really telling, because it\u2019s a leaf tradition for the jinchuriki\u2019s to be Uzumakis. They\u2019re really the only ones who can handle having the 9tails chakra sealed. Kushina wasn\u2019t Mitos granddaughter or daughter, but they belonged to the same clan, and looked similar. And Uzumakis can also technically be blonde if theyre not fully Uzumaki. (Tsuandes 1/4th Uzumaki, granddaughter of Mito). \n\n[uzumaki tradition](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uBPVCCMTjLU/Xvi1P-uKpXI/AAAAAAABM1Y/PUw-hfOnTRYkWKJP-N1ISdwEhmlZx-gAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/004.jpg)\n\n\nPlus, the circumstances of Kushinas birth were mostly kept secret. There may have been some that knew, but coupled with the fact that talking about the 9tails incident is forbidden, it makes sense it\u2019s not common knowledge among the villagers.\n\n[Kushina secret](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qiLTJzNLKu4/Xvi1QHM6omI/AAAAAAABM1c/SSI6ysZf31MLZyg2FKlAca9_ria1RnEMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/005.jpg)\n\n[Secret birth](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ifKXJRXd_YQ/Xvi1RyAECII/AAAAAAABM10/ttL2jPruRW4W9spgH9aZ4Ay2obx6BW6dACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/011.jpg)\n\n\nI don\u2019t really think Gaara being regarded as \u201croyalty\u201d did anything for him. It was in title only, and the villagers still feared and viewed him in disgust. Such is life as a jinchuriki I guess. \n\n\nAs for the history being taught at schools, yeah they likely don\u2019t teach anything relating to the circumstances behind the incident because it\u2019s top secret",

Look at today where despite use of lethal force being on the decline, people still act like cops are unhinged. Murders of officers will vary from year and from agency to agency but barring Border Patrol who is generally the most targeted due to opposing powerful cartels, murders of cops spike in the wake of anti law enforcement protesters such as the Dallas sniper killing five cops in the aftermath of the investigation into the death of Michael Brown.\n\nYou realize that the true villain ended up being Zetsu and Kaguya? Like they are responsible for playing the Uchiha and Senju aganist each other for thousands of years. I would have written the reveal, slightly differently with Kaguya sprouting from Madara killing him in the process after he almost beaten by Naruto and Sauske.

Point is authorities are glorified in Naruto, Uchiha cops were disliked because they were conceited and non-Uchiha cops weren't hated. Uchiha are at fault.\n\nHashirama is a moron. He knew Uchiha are batshit and had no solution for it. He knew Madara was unstable and hated and did nothing to help him. He was a sanctimonious hypocrite.\n\nIt's Tobirama who was the actual progressive here.

He was the one who bothered looking for [the root of Uchiha's issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvFz18UXMAc0QzA?format=jpg&name=small).

Advertising that Kushina was due to give birth and therefore her seal would be weakened to a dangerous point would\u2019ve completely defeated the purpose. Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary.

Minato actually teleported everyone involved in the sealing somewhere safe from the village and Hiruzen arrived when it was almost over.\n\n>Naruto wasnt of any royal blood, they wouldn't have had him in a house like the hyuga and have him sealed away from society.\n\nWhy would they even want to do that in the first place. Are you just typing for the sake of it? No one would've even known he was the Fourth's son except those with the Third at the time. And what does royal blood have to do with keeping him away from society of Hiruzen wanted to? Dude!",

Was Naruto born with the tailed beast or was it given to him? \n\n>But the only boy in the village with whiskers and animal characteristic when angry would be a safe assumption to say he's the Tailed beast's host. \n\n\nLike they were no ninjas born with weird characteristics in the entire village that his alone would standout; for example Torune was covered in poisonous beetles, Orochimaru was dead white.\n\n>The village know Kurama wasn't killed and any higher up like the Third or any anbu would know it was sealed, there is nothing to say they didn't reveal or spread rumors. I mean how else does the village in Part 1 know?\n\nThe same village that never knew he was Minato's son, for all they could know Kushina and her child died during the kyuubi accident while giving birth, only the Fourth was shown battling the kyuubi in the village. So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

And once again they obviously SOMEHOW knew, Naruto didn't even know until he was told but if a chunin like Mizuki knew his origins then it must've been amazingly obvious.\n\nAnd we don't know if they knew Naruto was Minato's or not, and even if they did why would they care? He's the host of a \"demon\".\n\nAlso from my understanding the Uzumaki were always host to the demon fox, and since Naruto is always screaming his name.

Obviously he'd have to disclose the info about this event to the Elders and Danzo and some other elite ninjas in his briefing of the village higher-up. His anbu of course won't rat.

Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

Like I'm pretty sure he saved some clans from dieing off. Like up until the 80s we were still using human as guinea pigs. I think what people see in boruto is the finished orochimaru he has completed his task he is immortal he can make a body to rival tailed beasts. I'm pretty sure he can cure anything. has both uchiha and senju cells laying around. I think it's than orochimaru just doesn't have to seek power cause he has it.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems.

Advertising that Kushina was due to give birth and therefore her seal would be weakened to a dangerous point would\u2019ve completely defeated the purpose. Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary. All the precautions possible were taken to prevent the Kyubi from even making it to the village unless something ridiculously catastrophic happened, like Obito returning from the dead with a Mangekyo Sharingan and advanced knowledge of seals.",

Was Naruto born with the tailed beast or was it given to him? \n\n>But the only boy in the village with whiskers and animal characteristic when angry would be a safe assumption to say he's the Tailed beast's host. \n\n\nLike they were no ninjas born with weird characteristics in the entire village that his alone would standout; for example Torune was covered in poisonous beetles, Orochimaru was dead white.\n\n>The village know Kurama wasn't killed and any higher up like the Third or any anbu would know it was sealed, there is nothing to say they didn't reveal or spread rumors. I mean how else does the village in Part 1 know?\n\nThe same village that never knew he was Minato's son, for all they could know Kushina and her child died during the kyuubi accident while giving birth, only the Fourth was shown battling the kyuubi in the village. So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

And once again they obviously SOMEHOW knew, Naruto didn't even know until he was told but if a chunin like Mizuki knew his origins then it must've been amazingly obvious.\n\nAnd we don't know if they knew Naruto was Minato's or not, and even if they did why would they care? He's the host of a \"demon\".\n\nAlso from my understanding the Uzumaki were always host to the demon fox, and since Naruto is always screaming his name. The village can again assume his relationship because \n\n1: Kushina was the only Uzumaki in the village\n2: Kushina was married to Minato\n3:Some and I say some people knew she was pregnant, most didn't though",

                                    "body": "Nobody is saying Fugaku acted perfectly; we're saying that Hiruzen's attempts at diplomacy were laughable. Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems.

From our point of view it may seem pretty obvious, but that\u2019s just because we know all the details.\n\nHaving Uzumaki as a last name isn\u2019t really telling, because it\u2019s a leaf tradition for the jinchuriki\u2019s to be Uzumakis. They\u2019re really the only ones who can handle having the 9tails chakra sealed. Kushina wasn\u2019t Mitos granddaughter or daughter, but they belonged to the same clan, and looked similar. And Uzumakis can also technically be blonde if theyre not fully Uzumaki. (Tsuandes 1/4th Uzumaki, granddaughter of Mito). \n\n[uzumaki tradition](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uBPVCCMTjLU/Xvi1P-uKpXI/AAAAAAABM1Y/PUw-hfOnTRYkWKJP-N1ISdwEhmlZx-gAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/004.jpg)\n\n\nPlus, the circumstances of Kushinas birth were mostly kept secret. There may have been some that knew, but coupled with the fact that talking about the 9tails incident is forbidden, it makes sense it\u2019s not common knowledge among the villagers.\n\n[Kushina secret](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qiLTJzNLKu4/Xvi1QHM6omI/AAAAAAABM1c/SSI6ysZf31MLZyg2FKlAca9_ria1RnEMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/005.jpg)\n\n[Secret birth](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ifKXJRXd_YQ/Xvi1RyAECII/AAAAAAABM10/ttL2jPruRW4W9spgH9aZ4Ay2obx6BW6dACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/011.jpg)\n\n\nI don\u2019t really think Gaara being regarded as \u201croyalty\u201d did anything for him. It was in title only, and the villagers still feared and viewed him in disgust. Such is life as a jinchuriki I guess. \n\n\nAs for the history being taught at schools, yeah they likely don\u2019t teach anything relating to the circumstances behind the incident because it\u2019s top secret",

You can't seem make up your mind and use any chance to justify Madara's bullshit.\n\nYour modern society rants are irrelevant here. Point is authorities are glorified in Naruto, Uchiha cops were disliked because they were conceited and non-Uchiha cops weren't hated. Uchiha are at fault.\n\nHashirama is a moron. He knew Uchiha are batshit and had no solution for it. He knew Madara was unstable and hated and did nothing to help him. He was a sanctimonious hypocrite.\n\nIt's Tobirama who was the actual progressive here. He had [ideas of peace before even Hashirama](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2or2dVcAEkQuk?format=jpg&name=small). He was the one who bothered looking for [the root of Uchiha's issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvFz18UXMAc0QzA?format=jpg&name=small). And he gave them power so [they can work with the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2orL6XUAgO-MK?format=jpg&name=small). He kept their dirty curse a secret. Tobirama made his naive brother's dream a reality by building the infrastructure.\n\nTobirama was already above the system and ahead of his time. You just have a hate boner Tobirama and a raging bias for Madara. It's clear as the day.\n\n\nZetsu only targeted the Asura reincarnation but as that panel shows Uchiha were always his main tool as we saw with Madara, Obito and Sasuke.",

Advertising that Kushina was due to give birth and therefore her seal would be weakened to a dangerous point would\u2019ve completely defeated the purpose. Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary.

Was Naruto born with the tailed beast or was it given to him? \n\n>But the only boy in the village with whiskers and animal characteristic when angry would be a safe assumption to say he's the Tailed beast's host. \n\n\nLike they were no ninjas born with weird characteristics in the entire village that his alone would standout; for example Torune was covered in poisonous beetles, Orochimaru was dead white.\n\n>The village know Kurama wasn't killed and any higher up like the Third or any anbu would know it was sealed, there is nothing to say they didn't reveal or spread rumors. I mean how else does the village in Part 1 know?\n\nThe same village that never knew he was Minato's son, for all they could know Kushina and her child died during the kyuubi accident while giving birth, only the Fourth was shown battling the kyuubi in the village. So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

But Kurama's chakra changed him obviously, because he has whiskers when he was born. No one else has that, not until Boruto and Hima. So again it's still a stay assumption he has the tailed beast. And once again they obviously SOMEHOW knew, Naruto didn't even know until he was told but if a chunin like Mizuki knew his origins then it must've been amazingly obvious.\n\nAnd we don't know if they knew Naruto was Minato's or not, and even if they did why would they care? He's the host of a \"demon\".\n\nAlso from my understanding the Uzumaki were always host to the demon fox, and since Naruto is always screaming his name. The village can again assume his relationship because \n\n1: Kushina was the only Uzumaki in the village\n2: Kushina was married to Minato\n3:Some and I say some people knew she was pregnant, most didn't though",

Naruto was already born with that facial mark before the sealing so that's not a valid point at all, after all his son had it too and didn't have kurama in him.

Obviously he'd have to disclose the info about this event to the Elders and Danzo and some other elite ninjas in his briefing of the village higher-up. His anbu of course won't rat. So for this to be common news in the village was devastating on his record. \n\nIt could've put both Naruto and the entire village in jeopardy, Orochimaru could've capitalised on it to have his revenge on the village and would've succeeded if not for scripting.\n\n>1: Kushina was the only Uzumaki in the village 2: Kushina was married to Minato 3:Some and I say some people knew she was pregnant, most didn't though\n\nAnd everyone knew Kushina was pregnant, she's the Hokage's wife my good friend.

As far as we see, he never reached out to Fugaku, never reversed Danzo's discriminatory policies, didn't invite any Uchiha into his advisory circle, didn't give any honors or recognition to Uchiha for their service, or take any other action that would show the Uchiha that they were valued members of the village. He basically just hemmed and hawed while Danzo continued to stir shit up, first with discriminatory policies and then by killing Shisui.",

                            "body": "Nobody is saying Fugaku acted perfectly; we're saying that Hiruzen's attempts at diplomacy were laughable. Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

It only ensured Obito would stick to the plan, and everything he did that was outside of the plan, like letting Kurama rampage in the Leaf instead of just taking him, or starting the bloodline genocide in the Mist even though he could have just taken Yagura while under genjutsu, was of his own free volition. Lets not forget murdering all of his own clan's literal children and babies while we're at it.\n\nObito is a genuine piece of shit who childishly convinced himself it didn't matter because \"real life was fake\" and therefore his actions had no consequences. He is as irredeemable as Orochimaru, with Madara not far behind imo",

Its after that first panel you linked.\n\n>\"By building the place station next to the prison under the pretext of facilitating the monitoring of crime, you conspicuously shoved the Uchiha to the margins of the village. That helped foster Madara adherents.\"\n\nThis is what Orochimaru says to Tobirama. I'd link it but i don't know how. Its Chapter 619, Page 11 though.\n\n>Madara is the racist who spread anti-Senju sentiment among his clan.\n\nThe only thing Madara said was that the village was clearly very Pro-Senju and Senju influenced and that the Uchiha would end up oppressed. That's not racist nor was he wrong. The entire council is people that Tobirama taught or in Danzo's case, led and the Uchiha ended up under close surveillance in a single place in the village\n\n>It's his fault Uchiha were massacred as his pawn Obito, framed the Uchiha for Kyuubi's attack.\n\nHe didn't frame the Uchiha. The council just immediately assumed it was them despite the fact there was zero reason to assume outside appearence.\n\n>Uchiha are whiny power hungry fools who brought it on themselves.\n\nExcept they literally didn't do shit to the village and have only been loyal only to be spit on in return.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems. Uchiha higherups are as evil as Danzo.",

Look at today where despite use of lethal force being on the decline, people still act like cops are unhinged. Murders of officers will vary from year and from agency to agency but barring Border Patrol who is generally the most targeted due to opposing powerful cartels, murders of cops spike in the wake of anti law enforcement protesters such as the Dallas sniper killing five cops in the aftermath of the investigation into the death of Michael Brown.\n\nYou realize that the true villain ended up being Zetsu and Kaguya? Like they are responsible for playing the Uchiha and Senju aganist each other for thousands of years. I would have written the reveal, slightly differently with Kaguya sprouting from Madara killing him in the process after he almost beaten by Naruto and Sauske.

You can't seem make up your mind and use any chance to justify Madara's bullshit.\n\nYour modern society rants are irrelevant here. Point is authorities are glorified in Naruto, Uchiha cops were disliked because they were conceited and non-Uchiha cops weren't hated. Uchiha are at fault.\n\nHashirama is a moron. He knew Uchiha are batshit and had no solution for it. He knew Madara was unstable and hated and did nothing to help him. He was a sanctimonious hypocrite.\n\nIt's Tobirama who was the actual progressive here. He had [ideas of peace before even Hashirama](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2or2dVcAEkQuk?format=jpg&name=small). He was the one who bothered looking for [the root of Uchiha's issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvFz18UXMAc0QzA?format=jpg&name=small). And he gave them power so [they can work with the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2orL6XUAgO-MK?format=jpg&name=small). He kept their dirty curse a secret. Tobirama made his naive brother's dream a reality by building the infrastructure.\n\nTobirama was already above the system and ahead of his time. You just have a hate boner Tobirama and a raging bias for Madara. It's clear as the day.\n\n\nZetsu only targeted the Asura reincarnation but as that panel shows Uchiha were always his main tool as we saw with Madara, Obito and Sasuke.",

Advertising that Kushina was due to give birth and therefore her seal would be weakened to a dangerous point would\u2019ve completely defeated the purpose. Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary.

So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

                    "body": "Nobody is saying Fugaku acted perfectly; we're saying that Hiruzen's attempts at diplomacy were laughable. Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

That helped foster Madara adherents.\"\n\nThis is what Orochimaru says to Tobirama. I'd link it but i don't know how. Its Chapter 619, Page 11 though.\n\n>Madara is the racist who spread anti-Senju sentiment among his clan.\n\nThe only thing Madara said was that the village was clearly very Pro-Senju and Senju influenced and that the Uchiha would end up oppressed. That's not racist nor was he wrong. The entire council is people that Tobirama taught or in Danzo's case, led and the Uchiha ended up under close surveillance in a single place in the village\n\n>It's his fault Uchiha were massacred as his pawn Obito, framed the Uchiha for Kyuubi's attack.\n\nHe didn't frame the Uchiha. The council just immediately assumed it was them despite the fact there was zero reason to assume outside appearence.\n\n>Uchiha are whiny power hungry fools who brought it on themselves.\n\nExcept they literally didn't do shit to the village and have only been loyal only to be spit on in return.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems. Uchiha higherups are as evil as Danzo.",

They\u2019re really the only ones who can handle having the 9tails chakra sealed. Kushina wasn\u2019t Mitos granddaughter or daughter, but they belonged to the same clan, and looked similar.

You can't seem make up your mind and use any chance to justify Madara's bullshit.\n\nYour modern society rants are irrelevant here. Point is authorities are glorified in Naruto, Uchiha cops were disliked because they were conceited and non-Uchiha cops weren't hated. Uchiha are at fault.\n\nHashirama is a moron. He knew Uchiha are batshit and had no solution for it. He knew Madara was unstable and hated and did nothing to help him. He was a sanctimonious hypocrite.\n\nIt's Tobirama who was the actual progressive here. He had [ideas of peace before even Hashirama](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2or2dVcAEkQuk?format=jpg&name=small). He was the one who bothered looking for [the root of Uchiha's issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvFz18UXMAc0QzA?format=jpg&name=small). And he gave them power so [they can work with the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2orL6XUAgO-MK?format=jpg&name=small). He kept their dirty curse a secret. Tobirama made his naive brother's dream a reality by building the infrastructure.\n\nTobirama was already above the system and ahead of his time. You just have a hate boner Tobirama and a raging bias for Madara. It's clear as the day.\n\n\nZetsu only targeted the Asura reincarnation but as that panel shows Uchiha were always his main tool as we saw with Madara, Obito and Sasuke.",

Tobi wouldn\u2019t have been the only person attempting to capitalize on it (he wouldn\u2019t have even been aware if not for Zetsu), and Minato was more than capable of quickly resealing the Kyubi before it escaped if necessary.

So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

Naruto was already born with that facial mark before the sealing so that's not a valid point at all, after all his son had it too and didn't have kurama in him. The whole point is about the Third Hokage's failure to contain his identity. \n\nLike I said previously, only the Third and his personal anbu were there at the moment of passing. Obviously he'd have to disclose the info about this event to the Elders and Danzo and some other elite ninjas in his briefing of the village higher-up. His anbu of course won't rat. So for this to be common news in the village was devastating on his record. \n\nIt could've put both Naruto and the entire village in jeopardy, Orochimaru could've capitalised on it to have his revenge on the village and would've succeeded if not for scripting.\n\n>1: Kushina was the only Uzumaki in the village 2: Kushina was married to Minato 3:Some and I say some people knew she was pregnant, most didn't though\n\nAnd everyone knew Kushina was pregnant, she's the Hokage's wife my good friend. The only secret was her delivery time and location.",

            "body": "Nobody is saying Fugaku acted perfectly; we're saying that Hiruzen's attempts at diplomacy were laughable. Hiruzen is the Hokage; he has a responsibility to act in the benefit of the village, not just sit in his office smoking his pipe while hoping Fugaku would reach out. If Hiruzen wanted to actually negotiate or engage in diplomacy, he should have made the first move, extended the first olive branch. \n\nDanzo wasn't investigating shit by that point. He had no evidence to support accusations against the Uchiha as a whole, and the Hokage's two Uchiha spies (Itachi and Shisui) found nothing to suggest any village member was behind the attack. As far as Itachi and Shisui knew, only Shisui and Fugaku had Mangyekyou; and neither was behind the Ninetails attack. Forcing the Uchiha to live outside the city, forcing them to be the police, forcing them not to assist in the Ninetails defense (this one, at least, had some security sense behind it), all of that contributed to the Uchiha feeling untrusted and despised by the rest of the village. And then there's the fact that Danzo planned to steal Shisui's eyes before even trying his plan; Danzo by this point saw the Uchiha as nothing but a source of eyeballs. \n\nHiruzen is also guilty of not recognizing Fugaku's wartime achievements. The story suggests that Fugaku's contributions were about on par with Minato's, but only Minato and Orochimaru were put forward as Hokage candidates. This, the Uchiha felt, was an insult to their contribution to the village. Two Senju and a Sarutobi were given the title before any Uchiha; and the Uchiha were one of the two founding clans. That no Uchiha held the office just reinforced the idea that Madara tried to sell his clan on: that the Uchiha had actually been defeated and conquered rather than made equals with the Senju. \n\nHashirama knew that giving recognition to Uchiha contributions would help heal the bad blood between the Senju and Uchiha. That's a big reason why he wanted Madara to be the second Hokage (though Madara ruined that idea). Tobirama tells Sasuke that he hired an Uchiha for his administration, and it seems like this person helped soothe Tobirama's own hatred of the Uchiha. \n\nIt would have cost Hiruzen almost nothing to invite Fugaku to sit on the advisory council once he learned Fugaku was not behind the Ninetails attack. Two random elders and Danzo currently sat on the council, there was definitely room for new blood. This new position would probably have prevented the coup outright since the Uchiha would finally feel valued and represented. \n\nThe other clans didn't need tons of extra special treatment because they didn't have the same history as the Uchiha. But these clans often got good treatment anyway, certainly none were forced to live outside the walls or hold jobs that bent the village against them. The Nara, Yamanaka, and Amikichi were well treated and held special bonds with the Sarutobi; so these clans had special access to Hiruzen and good treatment under him. The Senju held the first two Hokage positions as a founding clans before breeding into obscurity. The Hyuga and Aburame were given great deference to enjoy their privacy, which they seemed to enjoy. No other clan was given the shit stick by Danzo like the Uchiha were.",

I think what people see in boruto is the finished orochimaru he has completed his task he is immortal he can make a body to rival tailed beasts. I'm pretty sure he can cure anything. has both uchiha and senju cells laying around. I think it's than orochimaru just doesn't have to seek power cause he has it.",

So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

You can't seem make up your mind and use any chance to justify Madara's bullshit.\n\nYour modern society rants are irrelevant here. Point is authorities are glorified in Naruto, Uchiha cops were disliked because they were conceited and non-Uchiha cops weren't hated. Uchiha are at fault.\n\nHashirama is a moron. He knew Uchiha are batshit and had no solution for it. He knew Madara was unstable and hated and did nothing to help him. He was a sanctimonious hypocrite.\n\nIt's Tobirama who was the actual progressive here. He had [ideas of peace before even Hashirama](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2or2dVcAEkQuk?format=jpg&name=small). He was the one who bothered looking for [the root of Uchiha's issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvFz18UXMAc0QzA?format=jpg&name=small). And he gave them power so [they can work with the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2orL6XUAgO-MK?format=jpg&name=small). He kept their dirty curse a secret. Tobirama made his naive brother's dream a reality by building the infrastructure.\n\nTobirama was already above the system and ahead of his time. You just have a hate boner Tobirama and a raging bias for Madara. It's clear as the day.\n\n\nZetsu only targeted the Asura reincarnation but as that panel shows Uchiha were always his main tool as we saw with Madara, Obito and Sasuke.",

So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

Naruto was already born with that facial mark before the sealing so that's not a valid point at all, after all his son had it too and didn't have kurama in him.

Obviously he'd have to disclose the info about this event to the Elders and Danzo and some other elite ninjas in his briefing of the village higher-up. His anbu of course won't rat.

I'm pretty sure he can cure anything. has both uchiha and senju cells laying around. I think it's than orochimaru just doesn't have to seek power cause he has it.",

Uchiha don't live in police station. You know that, right?\n\n>That's not racist nor was he wrong\n\nIt is racist and he was wrong. He spread hate and his followers were pro-bloodbath and prevented peaceful negotiations. He was wrong as decades later Senju had disappeared while Uchiha still had their power and everything.\n\nOnce again, building a police station isn't pushing them out. Uchiha were stupid if they thought that. But I guess they are, they are literally cursed. \n\nYes, Obito framed the Uchiha. The suspicion was entirely valid. Obito even says had Danzo not passed the order, he would have attacked the Uchiha himself. Who do you think drilled this anti-Uchiha sentiment into Obito's head?\n\n>they literally didn't do shit to the village\n\nExcept that time they planned a bloodbath instead of diplomatically solving their problems.

I mean how else does the village in Part 1 know?\n\nThe same village that never knew he was Minato's son, for all they could know Kushina and her child died during the kyuubi accident while giving birth, only the Fourth was shown battling the kyuubi in the village. So for the village to know that Naruto was the vessel for the nine-tails is a failure on the Third's part to protect Top-secret information - which at the time only he and his personal anbu were privy to.\n\n>No one may know the Hokage is his father but they obviously know everything else.\n\nIf they didn't know the hokage was his dad, then they didn't know jack shit cos the first question should've been where did they get the child for the sealing from at that time when the normal villagers were locked up?",

You can't seem make up your mind and use any chance to justify Madara's bullshit.\n\nYour modern society rants are irrelevant here. Point is authorities are glorified in Naruto, Uchiha cops were disliked because they were conceited and non-Uchiha cops weren't hated. Uchiha are at fault.\n\nHashirama is a moron. He knew Uchiha are batshit and had no solution for it. He knew Madara was unstable and hated and did nothing to help him. He was a sanctimonious hypocrite.\n\nIt's Tobirama who was the actual progressive here. He had [ideas of peace before even Hashirama](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2or2dVcAEkQuk?format=jpg&name=small). He was the one who bothered looking for [the root of Uchiha's issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvFz18UXMAc0QzA?format=jpg&name=small). And he gave them power so [they can work with the village](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eu2orL6XUAgO-MK?format=jpg&name=small). He kept their dirty curse a secret. Tobirama made his naive brother's dream a reality by building the infrastructure.\n\nTobirama was already above the system and ahead of his time. You just have a hate boner Tobirama and a raging bias for Madara. It's clear as the day.\n\n\nZetsu only targeted the Asura reincarnation but as that panel shows Uchiha were always his main tool as we saw with Madara, Obito and Sasuke.",
