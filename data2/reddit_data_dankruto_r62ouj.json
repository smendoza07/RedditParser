You say it\u2019s not that simple yet still don\u2019t explain why it\u2019s so hard. Look at legend of Korra. They wrote a female character same way males are usually written",

For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

And was stuck in a Coma for over a month.\n\nYeah, Sasuke defecting makes sense since literally Itachi PUSHED him to doing it. Sasuke's hatred reached an all time high at this point and seeing Naruto, the class clown, being somewhat of an equal. Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

He literally did nothing but train chidori while Naruto was out having adventures with Jiraya.\n\n2. He literally did. He went to Orochimaru and trained harder than Naruto ever did in the entire series. \n\n3. Kakashi isn't a legend. Kakashi shat his pants when Orochimaru confronted him. Yes, Kakashi is strong for a leaf jonin, but training with him for months he learnt one jutsu, Orochimaru bit him, and he got a bigger speed and strength boost than even 2 tail Naruto, by doing nothing but being bitten. Then he meets the sound 4, who had the same power, but 4x as strong. And it's literally the easiest thing to get. All he has to do is take some meds and wait half a day in some box. \n\nYou don't understand, he wants to kill ITACHI. The man who made Kakashi lay in bed for a week by looking at him.  He also wants to kill itachi as soon as possible. Training for years with someone who has a lot of other stuff to do and is not even close to being as strong as itachi makes ZERO sense.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

Idc if that's a common trope, it's a shitty character trait that isn't even made up for with anything else. \n\nI love kishimoto's work and imo Naruto is one of the best manga ever when it comes to writing. But his female characters ain't it fam. Especially not Sakura. Tsunade is different, but Sakura kinda sucks as a character and only rly serves as a plot device for N and S respective character arcs.",

I like genuinely don't want to continue this conversation anymore. If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

I was actually hyped to see Sakura do something but then she just became complaining comic relief that either gets saved or attacked by the two MC's and even feels sad that Sasuke doesn't save her from fucking Madara. Again this is because Kishimoto is terrible at writing female characters, I just wish Sakura actually did more, Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori had me hyped up for more but she was just relegated to a reactions character.",

She was doing well until sasuke came back again, the only thing I liked was when she was willing to kill him even though she would have died trying, all so naruto wouldn\u2019t chase after him and die as the akatsuki was looking for him. She also seemed way better in the manga, the studio tends to make her worse than what was shown in the anime, a panel of sakura being worried for naruto was animated as her giggling at his demise which was weird.",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

Is that not bad vibes? People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

Sakura is not and tries not to understand why Sasuke calls her annoying. My argument isn\u2019t about whether someone\u2019s good or bad.

She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him.

Another example is Sakura being criticized by Sasuke. Sakura was criticizing Naruto and Sasuke told Sakura she\u2019s even worse than Naruto, then when Naruto tries to comfort her after she just criticized him she lashes out on Naruto. \n\nFor me, Naruto himself is an amazingly written character if it wasn\u2019t for him just taking Sakura\u2019s shit and enabling her to use him as an emotional stress relief bag. I just cannot stand that side of Naruto, he\u2019s enabling horrible and dishonest behavior of a person for no reason. It\u2019s not even just because she\u2019s a girl because we\u2019ve seen Naruto put female characters in order before. It\u2019s literally just because it\u2019s _Sakura-chan_",

The only thing she was shown to excel in was healing but in war naruto instantly got super healing. If the writing for Sakura was same as in Kazekage rescue mission she would have been a pretty good character. Like she reduced the amount she hit naruto and beat sasori. Making her fight against madara is just bullshit writing. She could have fought mid tier opponents like weak reanimated jinchuriki and kakuzu. If only sakura's character writing was consistent in shippuden, she could have been one of the best written female character. Out of 500 episodes she only defeated sasori and fodder. She could have been given genjutsu of strong level. The fact is power distribution in naruto is shit. You have god tier character and then mid or low wtier characters. In war arc Sakura could have been able to manipulate naruto's chakra and give it to people dying from god tree. During battle with Kaguya she could have been one to fight black zetsu. The fact is kishimoto cannot write female character. Sakura had the chance to become icon in shounen world but failed miserably due to bad writing. Oh and she could have beaten atleast one path of pain. If she would have same tier opponents, more role, far greater healing than naruto and tsunade, more personality other than being a simp, hitting naruto less(like say nami or noelle) and slight curve she would have been worshipped in anime world. There so many reincarnated opponents and sakura fought none. She should have at least wounded weakened sasuke without actually killing him. And instead of lying to naruto she could have fainted him after telling him the truth. There was so much wasted potential in Sakura",

Sakura, like danzo and orochimaru was not meant to be hated but poor writing did the unintentional. Sakura main goal is to surpass tsunade, help naruto achieve his dream and bring sasuke back to village. Adding fights will just make this more solid. I know the sakura we have cannot be changed but it could have been improved and this can help future writers to improve characters. What do mean personality? beating naruto, crying like a dumbass, not fighting enemies. If that is what you call personality than I do not know what to say. Sakura is a kind of character hated for bad writing and not for bad personality. I specifically picked characters to fight that would not effect story, kakuzu could have been defeated by naruto-sakura tag team, she could have defeated a path of pain but it would have been healed, defeating weak reanimated jinchuriki or just pinning them down would not have affected the story, while naruto and sasuke were fighting, she could have fought zetsu, he had to be defeated so that would not have affected the story. If any of these moments will effect the story then you tell me.  \nI genuinely like naruto anime, but sakura is a garbage person but the fact is earning from mistakes of old writers and thinking of what could have been done helps new writers. I know that sakura cannot be changed now but she can atleast serve as an example of how not to write a female character.",

Sakura always had adults watching over her and always got love from atleast some people around her. She was taught manners and she was provided love so her being so fixated on Sasuke makes no fucking sense at all. Naruto lived alone ever since he was a 5 year old kid and basically had no adult influence in his life until he met Iruka. I mean its not difficult to understand why he talked to Sasuke like that given the fact that no one was there to teach him manners and values as a kid unlike Sakura.",

Having parents does not mean that you are going to be taught proper manners, from my observation so far, Sakura\u2019s parents are too chill to be strict to her, they seem ignorant as well despite being nice and friendly. The only parents in Narutoverse (not counting Boruto) that were actually seen teaching kids manners were Sasuke\u2019s parents and Shikamaru\u2019s dad which is pretty unfortunate considering how many parents there were. \n\nFor Naruto, it is the same, just because I understand why he did that does not mean I would make it okay for him to say those kind of jokes.

But almost every single time an opportunity to show that arises she actively does nothing with it. She stands around, cries, screams names, and hesitates constantly. If having low self esteem when it came specifically to her combat capabilities or otherwise being afraid of what could happen to her in combat were focused character traits then that'd make sense and it'd be interesting. It would be good character development to see her overcome those flaws. But that isn't the case. Those aren't focused character traits about her, the author just underutilized her, but still kept her physically present. Which is obviously going to give everyone the idea that she's useless. The most powerful and capable person in existence would still be useless if they refused to do anything with their abilities. Sakura is like that. She has her moments and she does good. For a side character. But she has the presence of a main character and is thus underwhelming.",

Sakura suffers the most exactly for the reason that she's in the trio with two main male characters.\n\nShe just can't possibly outshine them, that would make bois less impressive. Instead, she needs to be weak and in need for help for Naruto to show himself off.  \n\nNotice how every time those two aren't around, she's a capable person, but the moment Naruto needs to be present on screen, she suddenly can't do shit and enters her \"Naruto, help\" mode.",

These scenes overshadow ALL the good things that Sakura did that were in the manga. Sakura had some scenes where she was being nice but those were just SP trying to make Sakura look good, which kind of makes it worse when you discover that those scenes weren't canon.",

The values of Ninja, the capabilities of Ninja, they haven't changed much since how it was defined at the beginning of the series. Ninja in real life didn't have chakra, they didn't have nukes sealed inside the bodies of children.  The power levels has changed yes, but it has remained far consistent until atleadt the third half of the war.

Sakura is easily kage-level and I don\u2019t think any kage-level character should be shat on for being \u201cweak\u201d. Along with that, her teammates already had extremely high potential with Itachi\u2019s sharingan and Naruto\u2019s chakra reserves and tailed beast. Not to mention, Naruto and Sasuke are 2 of the most driven characters in the anime. Sakura working as hard as Naruto and Sasuke still wouldn\u2019t result in her being as strong as them, she didn\u2019t have any latent abilities that could be awakened(other than her crazy physical strength, but she always had that) and her parents were not strong. Besides that, she trained in healing, so her ninjutsu skills were bound to be inferior to Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s. Sakura didn\u2019t use a single ninjutsu through all of Naruto, yet battles at extremely high levels with only taijutsu techniques. Her summon is a slug, which is very healing-oriented. She has very high resistance to genjutsu, but doesn\u2019t have any real techniques. Given all of this, her offensive options are almost as limited as Rock Lee\u2019s, but she still has chakra enhancement and a few sealing techniques, as opposed to Lee who just has the gates. Throughout the whole verse, Sakura is one of the strongest characters physically, up there with sage Naruto, Kisame, and Tsunade. As for battle strength, she is considerably lower in the ranks. I\u2019ve written too much, so to end it off I want to restate that Sakura is kage-level, which should prevent her from being called weak. People just love to clown her because she was a jerk before the timeskip.",

Madara still had his Susanno when he had no eyes so Sasuke will have his. Sasuke + Naruto have not reverted to their former child strength. Sage mode will multiply the power of base Naruto which would be more than enough to topple Sakura considering how fast and strong he is in base.",

I am going to tackle a lot of the main reasons why people hate Sakura in this comment. \nA lot of people hate her for her comment about Naruto being an orphan which is why he acts out. She is twelve years old. It\u2019s not right what she said but she was given a reality check by Sasuke and since then she actually decided to be nicer to Naruto. \n\nPeople seem to be under the impression she bullies Naruto. I\u2019d they watch the anime they have a lot of scenes like that for comedic value. But in the manga it happens with way less frequency. It\u2019s an old trope that hasn\u2019t aged well. \n\nSakura suffers from also being extremely intelligent and adept at chakra control and medical ninjutsu in a battle shonen. All these qualities would be really strong in a medical drama but this manga is targeted for adolescent boys wanting cool fights.  Sakura herself is pretty good at taijutsu but her skills are more outside of combat oriented. \n\nKishimoto seemed to rely on Sakura more for creating drama. And I believe she served that purpose fairly well.  A lot of people hate her confession to Naruto and call her scum for that but that was brilliant. Lying to get Naruto to forget about the promise because she felt like Naruto was suffering over it was brilliant.  Going to kill Sasuke herself was brilliant as Sai put it , it was out of love that she was going to do it to save him from his dark path.  She couldn\u2019t do it because she lacked the resolve to kill someone she had a deep bond with and this is something that is difficult. Kakashi himself resolved to do it and he even states he understood the turmoil the third felt when up against orochimaru. \n\nNow on Sakuras love of Sasuke. Oh boy. It\u2019s no secret her love of Sasuke in part 1 was immature. She had even planned on leaving the village with Sasuke. She\u2019s 12.  It keeps getting mentioned that her love for Sasuke is still there in later parts but it changed out of a genuine love that wanted to save Sasuke and help him rather than looking for reciprocated feelings. \n\nYea , Sasuke tried to kill her. But he tried to kill everybody. And the narrative intent was to show how unstable he was at the moment that even Sakura was on the chopping block for him.  And Sakura is the person that arguably had the most positive effect on him in part 1.  Theres probably more to say but I\u2019m tired.",

It wasn't just that Sasuke an Naruto were much more powerful, its that the writer minimized any impact she might have had to make room for the other two in the story. \nFor goodness sakes, when she started training under Tsunande, she mastered a whole bunch of truly powerful abilities through hard work and training, and people still joke about how Tsunande took it easy on her, or ranked her up just because she liked her or something. \n\nIt really didn't help that the author made her entire personality revolve around liking Sasuke. That's not Sakuras fault, that's the fault of lazy writing",

For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

Sasuke's hatred reached an all time high at this point and seeing Naruto, the class clown, being somewhat of an equal. Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

Kakashi is definitely the best written character cause showing small instances of subtle development over 700 episodes imo is way more impressive than showing development through complete breakdowns that Naruto and Sasuke had. Imo, Kakashi is the best written and he is followed by Naruto and Sasuke who both are equally well written.",

Yes, Kakashi is strong for a leaf jonin, but training with him for months he learnt one jutsu, Orochimaru bit him, and he got a bigger speed and strength boost than even 2 tail Naruto, by doing nothing but being bitten. Then he meets the sound 4, who had the same power, but 4x as strong. And it's literally the easiest thing to get. All he has to do is take some meds and wait half a day in some box. \n\nYou don't understand, he wants to kill ITACHI. The man who made Kakashi lay in bed for a week by looking at him.  He also wants to kill itachi as soon as possible. Training for years with someone who has a lot of other stuff to do and is not even close to being as strong as itachi makes ZERO sense.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

I like genuinely don't want to continue this conversation anymore. If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

I was actually hyped to see Sakura do something but then she just became complaining comic relief that either gets saved or attacked by the two MC's and even feels sad that Sasuke doesn't save her from fucking Madara. Again this is because Kishimoto is terrible at writing female characters, I just wish Sakura actually did more, Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori had me hyped up for more but she was just relegated to a reactions character.",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

Is that not bad vibes? People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

I\u2019m not saying insults and rudeness should not exist. They should, and the truth is that they do exist. I\u2019m saying don\u2019t be half assed about it. Sasuke isn\u2019t half assed about his rudeness whatsoever he means that shit all the way and is perfectly ready to accept it becoming personal. Sakura is not and tries not to understand why Sasuke calls her annoying. My argument isn\u2019t about whether someone\u2019s good or bad. My argument is that Sakura\u2019s a hypocrite and half assed AND NARUTO ENABLES THIS SHIT.\n\nNaruto enabling Sakura is what I can\u2019t stand the most",

If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

Another example is Sakura being criticized by Sasuke. Sakura was criticizing Naruto and Sasuke told Sakura she\u2019s even worse than Naruto, then when Naruto tries to comfort her after she just criticized him she lashes out on Naruto. \n\nFor me, Naruto himself is an amazingly written character if it wasn\u2019t for him just taking Sakura\u2019s shit and enabling her to use him as an emotional stress relief bag. I just cannot stand that side of Naruto, he\u2019s enabling horrible and dishonest behavior of a person for no reason. It\u2019s not even just because she\u2019s a girl because we\u2019ve seen Naruto put female characters in order before. It\u2019s literally just because it\u2019s _Sakura-chan_",

The only thing she was shown to excel in was healing but in war naruto instantly got super healing. If the writing for Sakura was same as in Kazekage rescue mission she would have been a pretty good character. Like she reduced the amount she hit naruto and beat sasori. Making her fight against madara is just bullshit writing. She could have fought mid tier opponents like weak reanimated jinchuriki and kakuzu. If only sakura's character writing was consistent in shippuden, she could have been one of the best written female character. Out of 500 episodes she only defeated sasori and fodder. She could have been given genjutsu of strong level. The fact is power distribution in naruto is shit. You have god tier character and then mid or low wtier characters. In war arc Sakura could have been able to manipulate naruto's chakra and give it to people dying from god tree. During battle with Kaguya she could have been one to fight black zetsu. The fact is kishimoto cannot write female character. Sakura had the chance to become icon in shounen world but failed miserably due to bad writing. Oh and she could have beaten atleast one path of pain. If she would have same tier opponents, more role, far greater healing than naruto and tsunade, more personality other than being a simp, hitting naruto less(like say nami or noelle) and slight curve she would have been worshipped in anime world. There so many reincarnated opponents and sakura fought none. She should have at least wounded weakened sasuke without actually killing him. And instead of lying to naruto she could have fainted him after telling him the truth. There was so much wasted potential in Sakura",

Sakura, like danzo and orochimaru was not meant to be hated but poor writing did the unintentional. Sakura main goal is to surpass tsunade, help naruto achieve his dream and bring sasuke back to village. Adding fights will just make this more solid. I know the sakura we have cannot be changed but it could have been improved and this can help future writers to improve characters. What do mean personality? beating naruto, crying like a dumbass, not fighting enemies. If that is what you call personality than I do not know what to say. Sakura is a kind of character hated for bad writing and not for bad personality. I specifically picked characters to fight that would not effect story, kakuzu could have been defeated by naruto-sakura tag team, she could have defeated a path of pain but it would have been healed, defeating weak reanimated jinchuriki or just pinning them down would not have affected the story, while naruto and sasuke were fighting, she could have fought zetsu, he had to be defeated so that would not have affected the story. If any of these moments will effect the story then you tell me.  \nI genuinely like naruto anime, but sakura is a garbage person but the fact is earning from mistakes of old writers and thinking of what could have been done helps new writers. I know that sakura cannot be changed now but she can atleast serve as an example of how not to write a female character.",

Sakura always had adults watching over her and always got love from atleast some people around her. She was taught manners and she was provided love so her being so fixated on Sasuke makes no fucking sense at all. Naruto lived alone ever since he was a 5 year old kid and basically had no adult influence in his life until he met Iruka. I mean its not difficult to understand why he talked to Sasuke like that given the fact that no one was there to teach him manners and values as a kid unlike Sakura.",

Having parents does not mean that you are going to be taught proper manners, from my observation so far, Sakura\u2019s parents are too chill to be strict to her, they seem ignorant as well despite being nice and friendly. The only parents in Narutoverse (not counting Boruto) that were actually seen teaching kids manners were Sasuke\u2019s parents and Shikamaru\u2019s dad which is pretty unfortunate considering how many parents there were. \n\nFor Naruto, it is the same, just because I understand why he did that does not mean I would make it okay for him to say those kind of jokes. He was never a person with high EQ (that is one of his obvious flaws) and he would probably be similar to how Boruto started out had Minato and Kushina been alive",

They always changed the way those stuff are happened in their fiction universe for the story they want to tell. The values of Ninja, the capabilities of Ninja, they haven't changed much since how it was defined at the beginning of the series. Ninja in real life didn't have chakra, they didn't have nukes sealed inside the bodies of children.  The power levels has changed yes, but it has remained far consistent until atleadt the third half of the war. The power creep starts there but we were only dealing with one nukes before but then we dealt with 7 and half of them.",

Madara still had his Susanno when he had no eyes so Sasuke will have his. Sasuke + Naruto have not reverted to their former child strength. Sage mode will multiply the power of base Naruto which would be more than enough to topple Sakura considering how fast and strong he is in base.",

For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

And was stuck in a Coma for over a month.\n\nYeah, Sasuke defecting makes sense since literally Itachi PUSHED him to doing it. Sasuke's hatred reached an all time high at this point and seeing Naruto, the class clown, being somewhat of an equal. Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

Yes, Kakashi is strong for a leaf jonin, but training with him for months he learnt one jutsu, Orochimaru bit him, and he got a bigger speed and strength boost than even 2 tail Naruto, by doing nothing but being bitten. Then he meets the sound 4, who had the same power, but 4x as strong. And it's literally the easiest thing to get. All he has to do is take some meds and wait half a day in some box. \n\nYou don't understand, he wants to kill ITACHI. The man who made Kakashi lay in bed for a week by looking at him.  He also wants to kill itachi as soon as possible. Training for years with someone who has a lot of other stuff to do and is not even close to being as strong as itachi makes ZERO sense.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

I read a lot of manga and do watch anime occasionally, female characters with no substance hitting the mc is not unheard of, but it'd a turnoff for me when I teach a show. Saying it's jap comedy won't make me like her more. It makes it worse rly.\n\nIt's not funny, wasnt funny when I watched Naruto as a kid. If someone else thinks it's funny, great, doesn't mean I have to like the character doing something annoying just cause others think it's funny. \nJar Jar Binks was annoying to me and many others. He's still funny to children, should i like him now? No. Can I still like star wars? Yes.",

I like genuinely don't want to continue this conversation anymore. If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

I was actually hyped to see Sakura do something but then she just became complaining comic relief that either gets saved or attacked by the two MC's and even feels sad that Sasuke doesn't save her from fucking Madara. Again this is because Kishimoto is terrible at writing female characters, I just wish Sakura actually did more, Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori had me hyped up for more but she was just relegated to a reactions character.",

She also seemed way better in the manga, the studio tends to make her worse than what was shown in the anime, a panel of sakura being worried for naruto was animated as her giggling at his demise which was weird.",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long?

She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him.

Another example is Sakura being criticized by Sasuke. Sakura was criticizing Naruto and Sasuke told Sakura she\u2019s even worse than Naruto, then when Naruto tries to comfort her after she just criticized him she lashes out on Naruto. \n\nFor me, Naruto himself is an amazingly written character if it wasn\u2019t for him just taking Sakura\u2019s shit and enabling her to use him as an emotional stress relief bag. I just cannot stand that side of Naruto, he\u2019s enabling horrible and dishonest behavior of a person for no reason. It\u2019s not even just because she\u2019s a girl because we\u2019ve seen Naruto put female characters in order before. It\u2019s literally just because it\u2019s _Sakura-chan_",

Sakura, like danzo and orochimaru was not meant to be hated but poor writing did the unintentional. Sakura main goal is to surpass tsunade, help naruto achieve his dream and bring sasuke back to village. Adding fights will just make this more solid. I know the sakura we have cannot be changed but it could have been improved and this can help future writers to improve characters. What do mean personality? beating naruto, crying like a dumbass, not fighting enemies. If that is what you call personality than I do not know what to say. Sakura is a kind of character hated for bad writing and not for bad personality. I specifically picked characters to fight that would not effect story, kakuzu could have been defeated by naruto-sakura tag team, she could have defeated a path of pain but it would have been healed, defeating weak reanimated jinchuriki or just pinning them down would not have affected the story, while naruto and sasuke were fighting, she could have fought zetsu, he had to be defeated so that would not have affected the story. If any of these moments will effect the story then you tell me.  \nI genuinely like naruto anime, but sakura is a garbage person but the fact is earning from mistakes of old writers and thinking of what could have been done helps new writers. I know that sakura cannot be changed now but she can atleast serve as an example of how not to write a female character.",

Sakura always had adults watching over her and always got love from atleast some people around her. She was taught manners and she was provided love so her being so fixated on Sasuke makes no fucking sense at all. Naruto lived alone ever since he was a 5 year old kid and basically had no adult influence in his life until he met Iruka. I mean its not difficult to understand why he talked to Sasuke like that given the fact that no one was there to teach him manners and values as a kid unlike Sakura.",

Having parents does not mean that you are going to be taught proper manners, from my observation so far, Sakura\u2019s parents are too chill to be strict to her, they seem ignorant as well despite being nice and friendly. The only parents in Narutoverse (not counting Boruto) that were actually seen teaching kids manners were Sasuke\u2019s parents and Shikamaru\u2019s dad which is pretty unfortunate considering how many parents there were. \n\nFor Naruto, it is the same, just because I understand why he did that does not mean I would make it okay for him to say those kind of jokes. He was never a person with high EQ (that is one of his obvious flaws) and he would probably be similar to how Boruto started out had Minato and Kushina been alive",

For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

Sasuke's hatred reached an all time high at this point and seeing Naruto, the class clown, being somewhat of an equal. Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

Yes, Kakashi is strong for a leaf jonin, but training with him for months he learnt one jutsu, Orochimaru bit him, and he got a bigger speed and strength boost than even 2 tail Naruto, by doing nothing but being bitten. Then he meets the sound 4, who had the same power, but 4x as strong. And it's literally the easiest thing to get. All he has to do is take some meds and wait half a day in some box. \n\nYou don't understand, he wants to kill ITACHI. The man who made Kakashi lay in bed for a week by looking at him.  He also wants to kill itachi as soon as possible. Training for years with someone who has a lot of other stuff to do and is not even close to being as strong as itachi makes ZERO sense.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

I read a lot of manga and do watch anime occasionally, female characters with no substance hitting the mc is not unheard of, but it'd a turnoff for me when I teach a show. Saying it's jap comedy won't make me like her more. It makes it worse rly.\n\nIt's not funny, wasnt funny when I watched Naruto as a kid. If someone else thinks it's funny, great, doesn't mean I have to like the character doing something annoying just cause others think it's funny. \nJar Jar Binks was annoying to me and many others. He's still funny to children, should i like him now? No. Can I still like star wars? Yes.",

I like genuinely don't want to continue this conversation anymore. If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot.

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything.

I was actually hyped to see Sakura do something but then she just became complaining comic relief that either gets saved or attacked by the two MC's and even feels sad that Sasuke doesn't save her from fucking Madara. Again this is because Kishimoto is terrible at writing female characters, I just wish Sakura actually did more, Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori had me hyped up for more but she was just relegated to a reactions character.",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

I\u2019m not saying insults and rudeness should not exist. They should, and the truth is that they do exist. I\u2019m saying don\u2019t be half assed about it. Sasuke isn\u2019t half assed about his rudeness whatsoever he means that shit all the way and is perfectly ready to accept it becoming personal. Sakura is not and tries not to understand why Sasuke calls her annoying. My argument isn\u2019t about whether someone\u2019s good or bad. My argument is that Sakura\u2019s a hypocrite and half assed AND NARUTO ENABLES THIS SHIT.\n\nNaruto enabling Sakura is what I can\u2019t stand the most",

Or trying to open a scroll that was forbidden to, being a perve at times when he wants to see women in baths, or when he tried to kiss her after she woke him up. At the end of the day there are moments nami hits luffy when he\u2019s not trying to kill them like when he playfully wore an armour on the ship, when he imitated sanji, or when he said she\u2019s being too loud. If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

Sakura, like danzo and orochimaru was not meant to be hated but poor writing did the unintentional. Sakura main goal is to surpass tsunade, help naruto achieve his dream and bring sasuke back to village. Adding fights will just make this more solid. I know the sakura we have cannot be changed but it could have been improved and this can help future writers to improve characters. What do mean personality? beating naruto, crying like a dumbass, not fighting enemies. If that is what you call personality than I do not know what to say. Sakura is a kind of character hated for bad writing and not for bad personality. I specifically picked characters to fight that would not effect story, kakuzu could have been defeated by naruto-sakura tag team, she could have defeated a path of pain but it would have been healed, defeating weak reanimated jinchuriki or just pinning them down would not have affected the story, while naruto and sasuke were fighting, she could have fought zetsu, he had to be defeated so that would not have affected the story. If any of these moments will effect the story then you tell me.  \nI genuinely like naruto anime, but sakura is a garbage person but the fact is earning from mistakes of old writers and thinking of what could have been done helps new writers. I know that sakura cannot be changed now but she can atleast serve as an example of how not to write a female character.",

Sakura did change overtime even though it was very poorly written. But then again, you can always say that understanding why she did that does not mean she can be forgiven for mocking an orphan but if then, it would make Naruto seem bad as well for joking about Sasuke\u2019s dead family, so in the end, they are both annoying kids that grow up. \n\nAnd honestly her attachment to Sasuke in part 1 is the same as other girls\u2019 crushes on him at best.

Sakura always had adults watching over her and always got love from atleast some people around her. She was taught manners and she was provided love so her being so fixated on Sasuke makes no fucking sense at all. Naruto lived alone ever since he was a 5 year old kid and basically had no adult influence in his life until he met Iruka. I mean its not difficult to understand why he talked to Sasuke like that given the fact that no one was there to teach him manners and values as a kid unlike Sakura.",

Having parents does not mean that you are going to be taught proper manners, from my observation so far, Sakura\u2019s parents are too chill to be strict to her, they seem ignorant as well despite being nice and friendly. The only parents in Narutoverse (not counting Boruto) that were actually seen teaching kids manners were Sasuke\u2019s parents and Shikamaru\u2019s dad which is pretty unfortunate considering how many parents there were. \n\nFor Naruto, it is the same, just because I understand why he did that does not mean I would make it okay for him to say those kind of jokes. He was never a person with high EQ (that is one of his obvious flaws) and he would probably be similar to how Boruto started out had Minato and Kushina been alive",

For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

He literally did. He went to Orochimaru and trained harder than Naruto ever did in the entire series. \n\n3. Kakashi isn't a legend. Kakashi shat his pants when Orochimaru confronted him. Yes, Kakashi is strong for a leaf jonin, but training with him for months he learnt one jutsu, Orochimaru bit him, and he got a bigger speed and strength boost than even 2 tail Naruto, by doing nothing but being bitten. Then he meets the sound 4, who had the same power, but 4x as strong. And it's literally the easiest thing to get. All he has to do is take some meds and wait half a day in some box. \n\nYou don't understand, he wants to kill ITACHI. The man who made Kakashi lay in bed for a week by looking at him.  He also wants to kill itachi as soon as possible. Training for years with someone who has a lot of other stuff to do and is not even close to being as strong as itachi makes ZERO sense.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

Saying it's jap comedy won't make me like her more. It makes it worse rly.\n\nIt's not funny, wasnt funny when I watched Naruto as a kid.

His bruises go after the next clip. Blame the author who tried to make a relatable teenage girl through the media he obviously consumes as it\u2019s not a realistic depiction. The comedy effect the author adds is just you saying you don\u2019t like his writing towards women, nothing on Sakura as she\u2019s not \u201cabusive\u201d if it\u2019s a cliche Japanese comedy they only add for laughs not psychoanalysis.",

Idc if that's a common trope, it's a shitty character trait that isn't even made up for with anything else. \n\nI love kishimoto's work and imo Naruto is one of the best manga ever when it comes to writing.

I like genuinely don't want to continue this conversation anymore. If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

Sakura, like danzo and orochimaru was not meant to be hated but poor writing did the unintentional. Sakura main goal is to surpass tsunade, help naruto achieve his dream and bring sasuke back to village. Adding fights will just make this more solid. I know the sakura we have cannot be changed but it could have been improved and this can help future writers to improve characters. What do mean personality? beating naruto, crying like a dumbass, not fighting enemies. If that is what you call personality than I do not know what to say. Sakura is a kind of character hated for bad writing and not for bad personality. I specifically picked characters to fight that would not effect story, kakuzu could have been defeated by naruto-sakura tag team, she could have defeated a path of pain but it would have been healed, defeating weak reanimated jinchuriki or just pinning them down would not have affected the story, while naruto and sasuke were fighting, she could have fought zetsu, he had to be defeated so that would not have affected the story. If any of these moments will effect the story then you tell me.  \nI genuinely like naruto anime, but sakura is a garbage person but the fact is earning from mistakes of old writers and thinking of what could have been done helps new writers. I know that sakura cannot be changed now but she can atleast serve as an example of how not to write a female character.",

Sakura always had adults watching over her and always got love from atleast some people around her. She was taught manners and she was provided love so her being so fixated on Sasuke makes no fucking sense at all. Naruto lived alone ever since he was a 5 year old kid and basically had no adult influence in his life until he met Iruka. I mean its not difficult to understand why he talked to Sasuke like that given the fact that no one was there to teach him manners and values as a kid unlike Sakura.",

Having parents does not mean that you are going to be taught proper manners, from my observation so far, Sakura\u2019s parents are too chill to be strict to her, they seem ignorant as well despite being nice and friendly. The only parents in Narutoverse (not counting Boruto) that were actually seen teaching kids manners were Sasuke\u2019s parents and Shikamaru\u2019s dad which is pretty unfortunate considering how many parents there were. \n\nFor Naruto, it is the same, just because I understand why he did that does not mean I would make it okay for him to say those kind of jokes. He was never a person with high EQ (that is one of his obvious flaws) and he would probably be similar to how Boruto started out had Minato and Kushina been alive",

For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

And was stuck in a Coma for over a month.\n\nYeah, Sasuke defecting makes sense since literally Itachi PUSHED him to doing it. Sasuke's hatred reached an all time high at this point and seeing Naruto, the class clown, being somewhat of an equal. Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything.

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

Or trying to open a scroll that was forbidden to, being a perve at times when he wants to see women in baths, or when he tried to kiss her after she woke him up. At the end of the day there are moments nami hits luffy when he\u2019s not trying to kill them like when he playfully wore an armour on the ship, when he imitated sanji, or when he said she\u2019s being too loud. If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

Sakura, like danzo and orochimaru was not meant to be hated but poor writing did the unintentional. Sakura main goal is to surpass tsunade, help naruto achieve his dream and bring sasuke back to village. Adding fights will just make this more solid. I know the sakura we have cannot be changed but it could have been improved and this can help future writers to improve characters. What do mean personality? beating naruto, crying like a dumbass, not fighting enemies. If that is what you call personality than I do not know what to say. Sakura is a kind of character hated for bad writing and not for bad personality. I specifically picked characters to fight that would not effect story, kakuzu could have been defeated by naruto-sakura tag team, she could have defeated a path of pain but it would have been healed, defeating weak reanimated jinchuriki or just pinning them down would not have affected the story, while naruto and sasuke were fighting, she could have fought zetsu, he had to be defeated so that would not have affected the story. If any of these moments will effect the story then you tell me.  \nI genuinely like naruto anime, but sakura is a garbage person but the fact is earning from mistakes of old writers and thinking of what could have been done helps new writers. I know that sakura cannot be changed now but she can atleast serve as an example of how not to write a female character.",

The only parents in Narutoverse (not counting Boruto) that were actually seen teaching kids manners were Sasuke\u2019s parents and Shikamaru\u2019s dad which is pretty unfortunate considering how many parents there were. \n\nFor Naruto, it is the same, just because I understand why he did that does not mean I would make it okay for him to say those kind of jokes.

            "body": "Okay. Might be a long post but I will try the best of my ability to explain it to you. \n\nWhat determines a good character? For large, it should be done in a way that should be relatable to people. One should be able to slip into their psyche. One should be able to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and what they want, their pain, their losses, and most of all their drive. Take Shikamaru mourning Asuma for example, his motivation for revenge, Naruto after Jiraiya's death, Sasuke's mental conflict upon hearing Itachi's truth (which had biasedness from Tobi to manipulate him). You can just feel them. \n\nAnd take Sakura's motivation. Might be a long time since I reread/rewatch Naruto but was there any other reason of Sakura longing for Sasuke other than cuz \"he's the coolest dude around\"? For teenage, or for some time, that could be justified, or just be viewed as a slightly over the top infatuation/relationship. Heck it is justified (even tho it isn't good) until like start of Shippuden. Then it went far, mainly after the interaction after Sasuke had killed Danzo. If she was shown to be trying to understand Sasuke properly  and learn about reality of Uchiha Massacre and all, and do that out of empathy of a friend who she once longed for, it would have been much much better than it currently is. \n\nWhy one cannot just write a character in one gender, create their personality and all, and just change the gender at the last is mostly because it isn't certain that the people of opposite gender look at stuff through the same eyes like you do. This may have sounded misogynist, but it was in no intention of mine to convey such. It is something that I have felt too cuz the interactions I have had with females weren't of that close. I haven't, in the majority of my life,  been someone that they would be confide to, and the talk I usually would have would just be superficial conversation. So their way of viewing stuff would largely be a mystery. Its not that you won't have a character when you do like what you said, it can work in some cases too, but that limits the variety of characters you can have, - simple/complex, characters that just appear as a mystery to you or characters that feel polarizing - and the dynamics that can exist between characters - whether they be conflict or anything (sorry specifics aren't coming in my mind).  I have read plenty of works where there are so good characters whose gender we wouldn't even know, and yet they are a lot enjoyable and relatable, but their dynamics in the story are really limited. You could check out Shimanami Tasogare. It has one such character.   \n\n\nAlso sorry if I wasted your time but couldn't explain properly.",

And was stuck in a Coma for over a month.\n\nYeah, Sasuke defecting makes sense since literally Itachi PUSHED him to doing it. Sasuke's hatred reached an all time high at this point and seeing Naruto, the class clown, being somewhat of an equal. Naruto defeating Gaara when he himself couldn't, Naruto's rasengan doing more damage than Sasuke' chidori, then what was Sasuke supposed to think? That he wasn't progressing enough. \n\nBecause of running into Itachi and getting mindraped, Sasuke became desperate. He NEEDED to avenge his clan and he felt Konoha just wasn't giving him the strength to do that, and seeing how quickly he progressed with Orochimaru's bit mark, it makes sense why he abandoned Konoha. He was convinced he was going to get the power to kill Itachi. The sound four themselves even shown him the power he could get when they kicked his ass. \n\nYou want to point fingers at someone? Do that with Itachi. He's the reason behind all of this shit. Because mentally raping a 12 year old (also doing this when this kid was fucking 8) isn't going to being positive effects on that kid's psyche.",

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

I like genuinely don't want to continue this conversation anymore. If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance.

You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him.

Yes, Kakashi is strong for a leaf jonin, but training with him for months he learnt one jutsu, Orochimaru bit him, and he got a bigger speed and strength boost than even 2 tail Naruto, by doing nothing but being bitten. Then he meets the sound 4, who had the same power, but 4x as strong. And it's literally the easiest thing to get. All he has to do is take some meds and wait half a day in some box. \n\nYou don't understand, he wants to kill ITACHI. The man who made Kakashi lay in bed for a week by looking at him.

In fact, you can argue he worked harder than Naruto did throughout the series. Look no further when he went to Orochimaru and how strong he became. I doubt Sasuke got that strength from eating Cheetos all day.\n\nLook at the chunin exams and how fast he mastered Rock Lee's speed. Again, another instance of Sasuke's hard work coming into play. \n\n>Maybe don't walk out on training to join some dude promising power when your teacher is a legend?\n\nOh sure, not like Orochimaru is one of the sannin, one of the most legendary ninja around. Not like Sasuke progressed more under Orochimaru than he did with Kakashi. Not like Kakashi shat himself when he saw Orochimaru.",

If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

You're reading way too much into my comment, take a step back and don't take this so personally. I find Sakura annoying because of her constant \"I will be like them\" because she says it all the time, not that she'll be strong but she'll be exactly like them, then there's the fact her last good fight was against Sasori(But tbf it was a great fight) but obviously every issue I have with Sakura is attributed to Kishimoto, i can't really blame a fictional character for being written badly.",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

Again this is because Kishimoto is terrible at writing female characters, I just wish Sakura actually did more, Sakura and Chiyo vs Sasori had me hyped up for more but she was just relegated to a reactions character.",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

I\u2019m not saying insults and rudeness should not exist. They should, and the truth is that they do exist. I\u2019m saying don\u2019t be half assed about it. Sasuke isn\u2019t half assed about his rudeness whatsoever he means that shit all the way and is perfectly ready to accept it becoming personal. Sakura is not and tries not to understand why Sasuke calls her annoying. My argument isn\u2019t about whether someone\u2019s good or bad. My argument is that Sakura\u2019s a hypocrite and half assed AND NARUTO ENABLES THIS SHIT.\n\nNaruto enabling Sakura is what I can\u2019t stand the most",

Or trying to open a scroll that was forbidden to, being a perve at times when he wants to see women in baths, or when he tried to kiss her after she woke him up. At the end of the day there are moments nami hits luffy when he\u2019s not trying to kill them like when he playfully wore an armour on the ship, when he imitated sanji, or when he said she\u2019s being too loud. If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything.

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

If it's shit then it's shit.\nI feel like you're misunderstanding me. I dislike Sakura for multiple reasons. The fact that she's hitting Naruto for no reason is one of them. Idc if that's a common trope, it's a shitty character trait that isn't even made up for with anything else. \n\nI love kishimoto's work and imo Naruto is one of the best manga ever when it comes to writing. But his female characters ain't it fam. Especially not Sakura. Tsunade is different, but Sakura kinda sucks as a character and only rly serves as a plot device for N and S respective character arcs.",

If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything.

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

Sanji stamped Luffy in the face comically when he flung them all onto the ship, Luffy kept hitting Nami in the back really hard once repeatedly so she tackled him. Carrot bit luffy for stealing her carrots without even asking (she\u2019s a rabbit). Nami attacked Luffy FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR MILLIONS OF BERRIES ON MEAT FOR A ONE NIGHT PARTY. MILLIONS. Even if they do attack him for making jokes (which I honestly cannot recall whatsoever but I don\u2019t really doubt too much if it\u2019s happened a few times as one piece is a thousand episodes now) they first and foremost strangle him when he hurts them or puts their lives in jeopardy comically or on a whim for the sake of \u201cfun.\u201d Nami even blushes when Luffy compliments her as navigator, or Sanji when Luffy called him the greatest cook. Luffy isn\u2019t desperately seeking their approval he just says these things honestly and whimsically when he feels like saying them or is happy without a second thought, meanwhile Naruto hesitates desperately or blushes to compliment Sakura and Sakura does the same for Sasuke. \n\nAnd that thing you said about \u201cthe same guy that almost tricked sakura into kissing him\u201d \n\nAre you implying that Naruto is a bad person or anywhere close to as maliciously intended as Sakura or Sasuke? Because he\u2019s a pervert and tried to take advantage of Sakura by pretending to be Sasuke, yet he still chickened out? I\u2019m pretty sure this whole entire sub and anybody who\u2019s ever watched Naruto will disagree with that (if that is what you\u2019re implying)\n\nLiterally everybody is a combination of good and bad. Naruto is clearly without a doubt summarized as a great person with a good spirit, even if there are a few bad things about him. Nobody\u2019s perfect. If people were perfect life would be extremely boring and nobody would ever be interesting. The fact that Naruto\u2019s few flaws are the first things we learn about him are meant to make him relatable to the viewer.\n\nEdit: if you wanted to use an example from one piece you should have tried Sanji. Sanji is a true pervert that deserves to be slapped in the face, YET HE STILL ALMOST NEVER GETS SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY NAMI AND NEVER BY ROBIN. One time I can recall Sanji getting attacked by Nami is when him Brook and Kinemon straight up walked in on Robin in the shower, or when Sanji hurt luffy really bad (luffy was trying to save Sanji from his family) without explaining.",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him.

Idc if that's a common trope, it's a shitty character trait that isn't even made up for with anything else. \n\nI love kishimoto's work and imo Naruto is one of the best manga ever when it comes to writing.

If any character in Naruto is perfectly written, it's Sasuke. I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

People have trauma, but you instigate serious fights that could kill the other, non comical fight. Nami hits luffy the most in the crew, robin doesn\u2019t, point blank. If the cliche hitting comedy is fine for one character and abuse for the other you\u2019re just bias. And what has compliments got to do with this? I\u2019m talking about the cliche Japanese comedy for hitting the male mc whether it\u2019s for simping or being \u201cdumb\u201d, it\u2019s cliche and unfunny but not abuse as they\u2019re trying to essentially have a \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d effect accept it\u2019s the fmc hitting the male. \n\nNaruto isn\u2019t bad, not don\u2019t justify nami hitting luffy when people can say the same for sakura by saying he made her uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t chicken out, rewatch the scene. The expired milk got to him and his jutsu was about to wear off, hence why he called it bad timing. If it wasn\u2019t for that stopping him he\u2019d have kissed her. Likewise, that scene was for \u201ccomedy\u201d and I personally don\u2019t find it funny but I don\u2019t use it as a reason to hate naruto. If it was switched around and Sakura pretended to be someone who sasuke liked and would be open to kiss, then it would have been agreed that she is malicious. I\u2019m just pointing out hypocrisy with \u201ccomedic\u201d scenes. \n\nI like naruto, and honestly if I hypothetically met team 7, I\u2019d like to be friends with naruto and sakura not sasuke.  Simply because someone attempting to kill me or anyone who tries to help him is more off putting than a girl who has the same personality as Ino. \n\nI get what you mean though, it\u2019s just odd seeing people emphasised anything sakura does even if the intent was cliche comedy, but ignore other things people do like ino body shaming multiple times. \n\nSanji is so weird, same with jiraiya when he got turned on when naruto transformed to a women (I like jiraiya but not the perverted side, I never laughed at this type of comedy). Like you said every character has faults, but in the naruto fandom, they highlight sakuras even if she\u2019s currently a good person. To them, character development means nothing when it comes to sakura, they still bring up chapter 3. She regurgitated what the adults in the village thought of him, now she built a trauma clinic for orphans as that could prevent them from going through what her teammates have yet her 12 year old self still shadows their depiction of her.",

If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Out of everything there is that\u2019s a flaw which I get, kishimoto tried to make a relatable girl but he doesn\u2019t have a realistic depiction of one and didn\u2019t make the effort to.\n\nHonestly, idk about naruto and how far he\u2019d exceed but sasuke almost died from madaras stab, he had to be revived by the god of ninjutsu, whereas at the same day sakura had the healing power to use herself as a decoy and get stabbed by a rod at madaras full power that turns everything it touches into dust, if that stabbed sasuke instead he\u2019d be dust. I don\u2019t think she said she\u2019ll be exactly like them, just strong like them. She\u2019s obviously not on their level, but sasuke and naruto had stepping stools, both coming from powerful clans and being given ideal abilities from the get go till the end with the whole reincarnated brothers thing. They were even taught jutsu\u2019s before she even knew any, kakashi didn\u2019t teach her any of his jutsu\u2019s he knew she went into training in shippuden by going out of her way to get another teacher but already had people thinking she\u2019s useless which she was because she wasn\u2019t taught anything. She didn\u2019t get the male treatment and that\u2019s on kishimotos part, so I can see why you\u2019d dislike her character",

At the end of the day there are moments nami hits luffy when he\u2019s not trying to kill them like when he playfully wore an armour on the ship, when he imitated sanji, or when he said she\u2019s being too loud. If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

Or trying to open a scroll that was forbidden to, being a perve at times when he wants to see women in baths, or when he tried to kiss her after she woke him up. At the end of the day there are moments nami hits luffy when he\u2019s not trying to kill them like when he playfully wore an armour on the ship, when he imitated sanji, or when he said she\u2019s being too loud. If authors are using the same comedy concept why are you mad at one character being used for it? \n\nWho said anything about ino physically assaulting people? Like I said sakura was used for the comical Japanese effect nami and many other fmc do. Ino wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even just her saying he\u2019s fat, she outright tells him how he won\u2019t find another women because girls don\u2019t like that and he should get fit even though it\u2019s his family genetics& relates to his jutsu as him eating gives him strength. \n\nWhat is sasuke being used as an example as if he didn\u2019t put their lives in danger and personally try to kill naruto Sakura and kakashi? A rogue ninja being used as an example? Oh so Sakura tries not to understand the same way naruto was not getting it for so long? Let\u2019s not talk about enabling as if naruto wasn\u2019t constantly defending sasukes actions and trying to see the good in him when sakura, the one who clearly accepted it being personal when she decided she should kill or even be killed trying to stop him. \n\nEnabling her to do what exactly? She doesn\u2019t want to kill him, wants him to remain alive, chose naruto and the ninja world over sasuke the moment he went rogue by trying stop naruto from putting himself in danger as the akatsuki was coming for him. Where was naruto? Begging the raikage not to harm sasuke, that\u2019s enabling. Sasuke should have been killed for being a criminal. Yet like the third with orochimaru, he wasn\u2019t.",

I was talking about those without any substance. Yes Sasuke follows that trope in general, but he's an \"edgy\" rival done well. \n\n>Go write a letter to the author for not attempting to do better with his female characters, trying to portray them as relatable teen girls when it\u2019s really just what he sees in the media. \n\nBruh what? Why tf should I write a letter to him now? \n\n>Why is Tsunade different? You say you hate the hitting trope but she does that with jiraiya?\n\nI personally am no big fan of Tsunade, but she's an actual character. She has a character arc, development and interesting part in important plot parts. The hitting thing, is a no for me, but even there it feels more natural than it does with Sakura. Jiraya is perving around, Naruto literally gets punched for things that aren't even his fault Sometimes. \n\n>Every single character serves as a plot device for those two\n\nThere's a difference between being nothing but a plot device than having an own arc and conviction that causes confrontations and sometimes a clash of ideologies. Especially the antagonists. Sure they serve to develop Naruto and Sasuke, but they're amazing characters on their own and even better when interacting with N or S. \n\n>At the end of the day, sakura is more likeable to me than sasuke. That\u2019s my opinion as like you said no one has to like the edgy revenge sidekick\n\nThat's your opinion exactly, but it's not what i said. I said edgy revenge sidekicks with no substance. Sasuke was the one who made the edgy revenge rival popular, i think if you ask anyone with a bit of a thing for writing about the best deuteragonists in anime and manga most are gonna have Sasuke at least in their top 5.\n\nIf you ask these same ppl about their favorite female support character, i doubt Sakura will even be mentioned. \n\n\nI'm not gonna shit on your opinion, since it's yours, but i dislike Sakura, a lot. Ask I've said before kishimoto is one of my fav writers, female characters ain't his pool tho",

She was doing well until sasuke came back again, the only thing I liked was when she was willing to kill him even though she would have died trying, all so naruto wouldn\u2019t chase after him and die as the akatsuki was looking for him. She also seemed way better in the manga, the studio tends to make her worse than what was shown in the anime, a panel of sakura being worried for naruto was animated as her giggling at his demise which was weird.",
