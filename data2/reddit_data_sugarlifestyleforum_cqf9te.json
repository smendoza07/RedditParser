    "body": "Early last year when I was in the transition of moving from NY to Southern California, I was on SA looking for potential sugar daddies in LA. \n\nFound someone who I found attractive. Now being on this forum for awhile, I\u2019m now remembering all the red flags. \n\nWe later exchanged numbers and had a lot in common. This older white guy named \u201cMike\u201d would text me everyday and we\u2019d have normal conversations. \n\nI was so excited because I was so naive and thought I had found a \u201cwhale.\u201d He would send me pictures of him and all his luxury items and would tell me how he\u2019s going to get me this that and the third. \n\nEventually I told him more about himself and vague things about my family like how I love to cook because of my mom and how she owns a Nigerian restaurant.\n\nAfter that I asked him what he\u2019s looking for in an arrangement.\nThat\u2019s when he told me how he\u2019s looking for an American woman to scam.\n\nTurns out Mike was a Nigerian man, living in who the hell knows, on the site looking for women to scam.\n\nI wasn\u2019t even upset at being catfished but I was more humored at the fact that a Nigerian was trying to scam someone who was Nigerian and didn\u2019t know until later.\n\nJust a funny moment that I randomnly remembered.",
