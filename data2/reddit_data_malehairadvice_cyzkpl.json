Then, section out a one inch section on the back, and roll the hair backwards with a one inch roller. It may be a good idea to use roller pins to keep the rollers in place. As you work your way forward, alternate one inch roller with .79 inch rollers. The row closest to your forehead should be all .79 inch rollers. It is critical you roll all the hair backwards. Try to keep your sections as neat as possible, and your sections should never be larger than the roller. \n\nAfter you have rolled all your hair you will either need to wait for your hair to be completely dry, or use a hooded dryer. When your hair is dry, remove the rollers and separate the curls as desired to achieve this look. Finish with hairspray :)",
