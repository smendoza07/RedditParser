    "body": "Went on a m&g, had a nice time and things were going well. We start talking  About our expectations. I tell him my PPM. He says \"I can't imagine paying that when I can go on the app and get a girl for next to nothing\".\n\nThen in the next few sentences compares women to eating at McDonald's.\n\nThis was AFTER  he was finished talking about how much money he makes w crypto and day trading. My ppm is not abnormal and I gave had successful arrangements in the past.\n\nAtleast I got a free weed pen and a glass of wine for my time.",

In front of people who were wearing everything but Rolex, from AP to Patek! \n\nWith this poor lost-looking girl a decade his junior for whom he didn\u2019t even bother to buy a nice dress for the event. Didn\u2019t even pay attention to how uncomfortable she was seeing everybody dressed way ritzier than she was warned about. Talking about how he\u2019s going to get a Tesla for his next car while apparently arriving in a leased 8-year old Audi. And all this bullshit alpha baller behaviour at an event at the host\u2019s expense! He\u2019s paying for nothing and smugly telling his date not to be shy about the champagne and canapes!

If they were to say that they specifically make a living at it, then it\u2019s super easy to objectively prove or disprove: statements and income tax returns for three consecutive years. \n\nAs for the guys who actually do it, for example, Tim Sykes and Warrior Trading, these guys prey on their students. Take Tim Sykes. If you sign up for his course, you will get alerts when Tim makes a trade AFTER he makes the trade. So his students pile in because \u2018OMG TIM BOUGHT THIS\u2019. 1000 students buying a few thousand shares simultaneously is going to create a buy wall, increasing the price. You can imagine what happens next. So yea, technically Tim Sykes makes a living off day trading. Technically.",
