YSK: The only reason they put on \"Platonic\" as a tag on this site is a way to not only cover their asses legally from being called an escort site, but also has the nice side effect of luring young, naive girls to it which helps immensely with their marketing about the guy/girl ratio here. So, there's that.\n2. If someone is giving you money, it's not platonic. If it were, you'd just ask any of your close friends who are platonic to give you money to hang out with them.\n3. It's a well-known meme in the \"Sugar Bowl\" that people who ask for \"Platonic\" are a laughing stock. Not saying you are, but it really is a joke.\n4. I, personally, have 1833 current unread messages and routinely talk to 30+ women at a time while I'm looking for new arrangements. The vast majority of them are willing to have an actual adult, mature relationship of some sort of romantic kind and aren't trying to get paid just for showing up, which is essentially what a \"platonic arrangement\" is. That is your competition.\n5. Which....lol the entire concept of me paying someone to hang out with them......I'm extremely social. I meet dozens of people a week. Why would I ever do that? It's a sucker's game.\n6. I may not be open to anything platonic in any sense of the word, but I do have a healthy respect for taking things slow and actually building a relationship, rather than just rushing into intimacy on the first date like you're a hooker or something.\n7. If you want to get suckers to simp for you, by giving you money for just showing up....and doing nothing but talking, start a Twitch account. Plenty of horny nerds there for you who will just listen to you talk on cam while you wear a low cut top and give \"donations\".\n\nConclusion: I'm very not okay with anything platonic, but I'm not looking for a sex worker, either. I hoped I shed some light on this subject.",

Many have no idea.\n\nHell, we have plenty of platonic friends we\u2019ve found from SA that aren\u2019t matches for us, who just ask us about how to navigate the sugar bowl because they get an honest opinion.\n\nAn asshole I am not, we\u2019re 43 SD and 36 SM, with a filter of 30+, but it doesn\u2019t stop the onslaught of younger social media onlookers.\n\nSophisticated:  having, revealing, or proceeding from a great deal of worldly experience and knowledge of fashion and culture.\n\nMany young SB/SGF\u2019s are not sophisticated in the  world of SR.\n\nYes, we\u2019re the big bad 43/36 year old preying on 30-40 year old women... we\u2019re absolutely monsters.\n\nIf I\u2019m dealing with women, I don\u2019t have to worry about looking down on girls, it\u2019s not my audience.\n\nReality is a beautiful thing.",
