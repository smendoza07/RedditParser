No offense to Kishi, I love the man for this franchise, his art and everything else--but if *one* more thing gets retconned I might start crying.\n\nLike yknow? *Why* this Izuna Uchiha refused peace? He lives with Madara for god's sake--even Tobirama came around with a sigh and said \"Okay, maybe we can make this work\" despite being extremely cynical. So if Madara believes in peace and is close with his brother wouldn't he talk about it extensively? wouldn't that influence Izuna? Or was there something economical? Like the Uchiha not wearing armors in the founders period and the senju being fully decked up.\n\nAnyway, Im very interested in that.\n\nFor Minato I suggest everyone to read this fanfiction called \"Girl from Whirlpool\" from Silvershine. Its an AU, but if we get it animated with some canon-ish tweaks I'd blast fireworks.",

He thought it was childish and foolish later but he *never* brought it up with Izuna?? Why would Izuna dismiss it completely (unless he thought his brother was stupid too and wont be able to fend for himself if tricked) when *both* of them were clan heads? I just find that strange. Hashirama going \"we share the same dream\" just seems so weird after that.\n\nI thought Tobirama was thinking of it in a contract-sense. Like, why the hell are they all fighting? Are they stupid? But I don't think he'd fight to kill Izuna if he still believed in signing one of those. He probably thought it was hopeless until they subjugate the other--but hashiram kept pushing for it.\n\nWhatever.

Tobirama said clans should reach a truce. He enever even talked about subjugation\n And he killed Izuna because it was a life-and-death situation. Tobirama getting himself killed wouldn't have brought peace.\n\nAgreed in Minato. He's extremely bland and a spin-off is the last thing he deserves.",

Im just saying Izuna should have seen the advantages at least. The data books call him \"harmonious\" for god's sake. It'd be bland if he was just \"kukuku i revel in the curse of hatred\".\n\n2) YES. I don't know *why* he keeps saying that, like bro, just say you enjoy his company, okay? Pretty sure you and mito can work something out--he doesn't look half that bad and y'all can do whatever. But please stop saying he shared your dream because he didnt'?? Hashirama's like this child--he was the first person who hashirama actively dreamed *with* about what to do--so he's attached and keeps wanting madara to stay smh.\n\n3) I actually thought he made the ftg *to* kill izuna and end him before he ends anymore senju. Like, a truce would be impossible from mads the clan head if izuna died--or maybe he might have thought izuna *is* the one holding their clan head back from accepting hashi's loud proclamations. Orrr, you remember him asking \"wait where's izuna?\" at the peace talks? he didn't expect izuna to die.\n\nAww, Im actually kinda biased about Minato after reading TGfW, but I definitely understand how bland he is in canon tbh. Kishi had to make him perfect in the short time we saw him. I do like him and his potential since we don't see much of his thoughts or aspirations (perfect si insert character to mould like sakura or kakashi since he doesn't have much of a personality).\n\nSo I don't want a minato one because I already have this person in my head from silvershine's work and if the anime makes him a gray sue i might cry.",

This given, it could make for an interesting plot to introduce the Namikaze Clan and tell a story of why we haven\u2019t heard of them (extinction?). \n\n3. Not only was Fugaku the standing leader of the Uchiha clan, he was also Captain of the Police Force, and considered to be the 4th Hokage (albeit by his own clan), a competitor to the likes of Orochimaru and Minato. So he had to have been powerful, no?\n\nAgain, not sure why you\u2019re mad here? Sorry I didn\u2019t take the time to fact check my opinion.

Again a shitty retcon because the manga had made it clear on many occasions that Minato and Orochimaru are the only nominees. The only reason Hiruzen dragged himself to be Hokage again after Minato's death was because there was no one else worthy.

He wanted to solve things with words. \n\nA sage like Naruto traveling the world also opens up for more adventures.\n\nSecondly, in this series if we really wanted to see Uchiha redemption we should have seen Sasuke as Hokage instead. (Finally an Uchiha in office).\n\nInstead Sasuke goes off as life long punishment, something decided in one singular moment, and nothing about clan restoration comes forward ever again. \n\nSo I think Naruto and Sasuke character arcs should have been swapped.\n\nMaking Naruto hokage was lazy writing. After everything Naruto had experienced I think it would make more sense that he would change his mind and decide traveling the different villages would be more fruitful than keeping his God like powers inside Konoha. He is basically just another tailed beast deterrent.",

These lands also exist in the same timeline as what we see in the Naruto series. All of the lands are separated by the Great Rift of Chakra, to bypass this one must defeat a guardian that appears when one approaches the great rift. The guardian is like super powerful and basically no one has bested it (I think). I don\u2019t know if this is canon but it was on the official wiki but if not this is still super cool.\n\nhttps://narutofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Distant_Continents\n\n2)Land of Iron\n    Samurai are only briefly touched on during the war but I want to see a protagonist become on of the best samurai. The idea that there are other soldiers besides ninja and we don\u2019t even know 100% about is kind of disappointing. Of course focusing on samurai instead of ninja in Naruto would be stupid so a separate show would be awesome.\n\n3)Orochimaru\u2019s experiments \n    This one is out of left field but I thought it would be kind of cool to see the point of Brie from one of Orochimaru\u2019s experiments during the Naruto series. Like we see the Chuunin exams, Sasuke coming for power, and the war from their eyes since we really don\u2019t know what happened to any of the people Orochimaru was hiding, besides people on Team Taka/hebi. \n\n\n4) Other villages and clans\n     This is pretty straightforward, just make a mini series of something to expand on the world of Naruto.\n\nI probably am going to think of more ideas later but I\u2019m too tired rn so I\u2019m leaving this at four.",

He thought it was childish and foolish later but he *never* brought it up with Izuna?? Why would Izuna dismiss it completely (unless he thought his brother was stupid too and wont be able to fend for himself if tricked) when *both* of them were clan heads? I just find that strange. Hashirama going \"we share the same dream\" just seems so weird after that.\n\nI thought Tobirama was thinking of it in a contract-sense. Like, why the hell are they all fighting? Are they stupid? But I don't think he'd fight to kill Izuna if he still believed in signing one of those. He probably thought it was hopeless until they subjugate the other--but hashiram kept pushing for it.\n\nWhatever.

The only time he showed interest in it was when he was a child and interested in protecting his last brother. There is a reason Hashirama kept saying Madara understood him when the the poor guy never even agreed with what he said. All these show Hashirama is either delusional or a liar.\n\n3. Tobirama said clans should reach a truce. He enever even talked about subjugation\n And he killed Izuna because it was a life-and-death situation. Tobirama getting himself killed wouldn't have brought peace.\n\nAgreed in Minato. He's extremely bland and a spin-off is the last thing he deserves.",

Im just saying Izuna should have seen the advantages at least. The data books call him \"harmonious\" for god's sake. It'd be bland if he was just \"kukuku i revel in the curse of hatred\".\n\n2) YES. I don't know *why* he keeps saying that, like bro, just say you enjoy his company, okay? Pretty sure you and mito can work something out--he doesn't look half that bad and y'all can do whatever. But please stop saying he shared your dream because he didnt'?? Hashirama's like this child--he was the first person who hashirama actively dreamed *with* about what to do--so he's attached and keeps wanting madara to stay smh.\n\n3) I actually thought he made the ftg *to* kill izuna and end him before he ends anymore senju. Like, a truce would be impossible from mads the clan head if izuna died--or maybe he might have thought izuna *is* the one holding their clan head back from accepting hashi's loud proclamations. Orrr, you remember him asking \"wait where's izuna?\" at the peace talks? he didn't expect izuna to die.\n\nAww, Im actually kinda biased about Minato after reading TGfW, but I definitely understand how bland he is in canon tbh. Kishi had to make him perfect in the short time we saw him. I do like him and his potential since we don't see much of his thoughts or aspirations (perfect si insert character to mould like sakura or kakashi since he doesn't have much of a personality).\n\nSo I don't want a minato one because I already have this person in my head from silvershine's work and if the anime makes him a gray sue i might cry.",

The Uchiha already felt segregated when Tobirama based the police force on the outskirts \n\n2. Namikaze being a clan might not be accurate, but there\u2019s speculation among the fans whether it is or isn\u2019t. This given, it could make for an interesting plot to introduce the Namikaze Clan and tell a story of why we haven\u2019t heard of them (extinction?). \n\n3. Not only was Fugaku the standing leader of the Uchiha clan, he was also Captain of the Police Force, and considered to be the 4th Hokage (albeit by his own clan), a competitor to the likes of Orochimaru and Minato. So he had to have been powerful, no?\n\nAgain, not sure why you\u2019re mad here? Sorry I didn\u2019t take the time to fact check my opinion.

Getting offended because the police station was built next to a prison on the outskirts sounds backward even for the Uchiha. It was made clear many times that Danzo relocated the Uchiha compound. \n\n2. That's called a retcon and there is nothing clever or interesting about it when Kishimoto made sure to name and distinguish all clans.\n\n3. Filler trash. Again a shitty retcon because the manga had made it clear on many occasions that Minato and Orochimaru are the only nominees. The only reason Hiruzen dragged himself to be Hokage again after Minato's death was because there was no one else worthy. Filler trash ain't worth shit.\n\nSorry if you got offended but I've seen too many trolls in this sub getting lauded for spreading misinformation.",

He thought it was childish and foolish later but he *never* brought it up with Izuna?? Why would Izuna dismiss it completely (unless he thought his brother was stupid too and wont be able to fend for himself if tricked) when *both* of them were clan heads? I just find that strange. Hashirama going \"we share the same dream\" just seems so weird after that.\n\nI thought Tobirama was thinking of it in a contract-sense. Like, why the hell are they all fighting? Are they stupid? But I don't think he'd fight to kill Izuna if he still believed in signing one of those. He probably thought it was hopeless until they subjugate the other--but hashiram kept pushing for it.\n\nWhatever. I want a warring states era one instead of Minato's because TGFW was more than enough for me tbh.",

The only time he showed interest in it was when he was a child and interested in protecting his last brother. There is a reason Hashirama kept saying Madara understood him when the the poor guy never even agreed with what he said. All these show Hashirama is either delusional or a liar.\n\n3. Tobirama said clans should reach a truce. He enever even talked about subjugation\n And he killed Izuna because it was a life-and-death situation. Tobirama getting himself killed wouldn't have brought peace.\n\nAgreed in Minato. He's extremely bland and a spin-off is the last thing he deserves.",

Im just saying Izuna should have seen the advantages at least. The data books call him \"harmonious\" for god's sake. It'd be bland if he was just \"kukuku i revel in the curse of hatred\".\n\n2) YES. I don't know *why* he keeps saying that, like bro, just say you enjoy his company, okay? Pretty sure you and mito can work something out--he doesn't look half that bad and y'all can do whatever. But please stop saying he shared your dream because he didnt'?? Hashirama's like this child--he was the first person who hashirama actively dreamed *with* about what to do--so he's attached and keeps wanting madara to stay smh.\n\n3) I actually thought he made the ftg *to* kill izuna and end him before he ends anymore senju. Like, a truce would be impossible from mads the clan head if izuna died--or maybe he might have thought izuna *is* the one holding their clan head back from accepting hashi's loud proclamations. Orrr, you remember him asking \"wait where's izuna?\" at the peace talks? he didn't expect izuna to die.\n\nAww, Im actually kinda biased about Minato after reading TGfW, but I definitely understand how bland he is in canon tbh. Kishi had to make him perfect in the short time we saw him. I do like him and his potential since we don't see much of his thoughts or aspirations (perfect si insert character to mould like sakura or kakashi since he doesn't have much of a personality).\n\nSo I don't want a minato one because I already have this person in my head from silvershine's work and if the anime makes him a gray sue i might cry.",

This given, it could make for an interesting plot to introduce the Namikaze Clan and tell a story of why we haven\u2019t heard of them (extinction?). \n\n3. Not only was Fugaku the standing leader of the Uchiha clan, he was also Captain of the Police Force, and considered to be the 4th Hokage (albeit by his own clan), a competitor to the likes of Orochimaru and Minato. So he had to have been powerful, no?\n\nAgain, not sure why you\u2019re mad here? Sorry I didn\u2019t take the time to fact check my opinion.

Again a shitty retcon because the manga had made it clear on many occasions that Minato and Orochimaru are the only nominees.

Tobirama said clans should reach a truce. He enever even talked about subjugation\n And he killed Izuna because it was a life-and-death situation. Tobirama getting himself killed wouldn't have brought peace.\n\nAgreed in Minato. He's extremely bland and a spin-off is the last thing he deserves.",

Im just saying Izuna should have seen the advantages at least. The data books call him \"harmonious\" for god's sake. It'd be bland if he was just \"kukuku i revel in the curse of hatred\".\n\n2) YES. I don't know *why* he keeps saying that, like bro, just say you enjoy his company, okay? Pretty sure you and mito can work something out--he doesn't look half that bad and y'all can do whatever. But please stop saying he shared your dream because he didnt'?? Hashirama's like this child--he was the first person who hashirama actively dreamed *with* about what to do--so he's attached and keeps wanting madara to stay smh.\n\n3) I actually thought he made the ftg *to* kill izuna and end him before he ends anymore senju. Like, a truce would be impossible from mads the clan head if izuna died--or maybe he might have thought izuna *is* the one holding their clan head back from accepting hashi's loud proclamations. Orrr, you remember him asking \"wait where's izuna?\" at the peace talks? he didn't expect izuna to die.\n\nAww, Im actually kinda biased about Minato after reading TGfW, but I definitely understand how bland he is in canon tbh. Kishi had to make him perfect in the short time we saw him. I do like him and his potential since we don't see much of his thoughts or aspirations (perfect si insert character to mould like sakura or kakashi since he doesn't have much of a personality).\n\nSo I don't want a minato one because I already have this person in my head from silvershine's work and if the anime makes him a gray sue i might cry.",

Again a shitty retcon because the manga had made it clear on many occasions that Minato and Orochimaru are the only nominees. The only reason Hiruzen dragged himself to be Hokage again after Minato's death was because there was no one else worthy. Filler trash ain't worth shit.\n\nSorry if you got offended but I've seen too many trolls in this sub getting lauded for spreading misinformation.",

            "body": ">If he didn't believe in it, then why should Izuna?\n\n1) I didnt mean that as a complaint! Its perfectly understandable. Im just saying Izuna should have seen the advantages at least. The data books call him \"harmonious\" for god's sake. It'd be bland if he was just \"kukuku i revel in the curse of hatred\".\n\n2) YES. I don't know *why* he keeps saying that, like bro, just say you enjoy his company, okay? Pretty sure you and mito can work something out--he doesn't look half that bad and y'all can do whatever. But please stop saying he shared your dream because he didnt'?? Hashirama's like this child--he was the first person who hashirama actively dreamed *with* about what to do--so he's attached and keeps wanting madara to stay smh.\n\n3) I actually thought he made the ftg *to* kill izuna and end him before he ends anymore senju. Like, a truce would be impossible from mads the clan head if izuna died--or maybe he might have thought izuna *is* the one holding their clan head back from accepting hashi's loud proclamations. Orrr, you remember him asking \"wait where's izuna?\" at the peace talks? he didn't expect izuna to die.\n\nAww, Im actually kinda biased about Minato after reading TGfW, but I definitely understand how bland he is in canon tbh. Kishi had to make him perfect in the short time we saw him. I do like him and his potential since we don't see much of his thoughts or aspirations (perfect si insert character to mould like sakura or kakashi since he doesn't have much of a personality).\n\nSo I don't want a minato one because I already have this person in my head from silvershine's work and if the anime makes him a gray sue i might cry.",
