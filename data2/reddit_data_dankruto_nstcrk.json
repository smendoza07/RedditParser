Their lives also mirrored a lot in certain aspects. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the writer was showing the different paths that could have been taken under different circumstances and how Naruto could have turned out.\n\nThe thing that I never understood is that Kakashi never realized Naruto is Minato\u2019s grandson and that he\u2019s a lot like Obito. You think he would have tried harder to slap some sense into Naruto or been more patient at times if he knew. Kakashi did think up the special shadow clone training for Naruto though. Which basically boosted him a lot and he used the principles of that lesson multiple times.",

You think he would have tried harder to slap some sense into Naruto or been more patient at times if he knew. Kakashi did think up the special shadow clone training for Naruto though.

He was willing to forget his revenge plans and die for his friend. How is that not stronger than Madara who ditched Hashirama once he realised he's a Senju?\n\nMadara was so distrustful of Hashirama that he constantly refused his peace offers until his last brother died.\n\n> they made konoha together\n\nYou mean Hashirama and Tobirama did as Madara left the village soon because he lost an election to Hashirama. That unnamed Uchiha who replaced Madara as clan head likely did more for the village than Madara ever did.",

You think he would have tried harder to slap some sense into Naruto or been more patient at times if he knew. Kakashi did think up the special shadow clone training for Naruto though.
