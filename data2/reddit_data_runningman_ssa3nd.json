Like that last joke was only made to be funny because of the way Jae Suk kept repeating it. It's more like it's a stage play for the audience than a competitive game.\n\nBut when they do it on Running Man these days (rarely thankfully) there's so much less theatrics. It's really relying on the participants to come up with funny questions but it sorta lacks the concession that it's a play for the audience more than it is an actual game. It still sometimes worked on Running Man because it let them mock each other, don't get me wrong. It's just interesting to me to see the differences in implementation.",
