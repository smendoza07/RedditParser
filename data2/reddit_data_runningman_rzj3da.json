She is a pro.\n\nOne thing the jokingly members said about her, is that how when they pull or prank on her or hit a sensitive topic when filming, she call them later and start complaining \ud83d\ude02 but what do we see on screen? Just a cheerful smile from her, no matter what they do to her, she just laugh it off, or even respond positively to it. I like that attitude about her. She also never nap or play on her phone when on RM, not even during break times. How dedicated to her craft is admirable, a role model. We all can relate to Somin really... She struggled the most in her early years, experienced things one cannot begin to imagine... While waiting for a chance, a chance to prove herself. When that chance came, she grabbed it right away and use it to the most of abilities. That's why she adapted and started adding to RM right after joining. I hope she just take good care of herself, and meet someone who would appreciate how amazing of a women she is.",

If I'm not mistaken, that was her busiest period (2 variety shows, 2 dramas in a week). I never saw her fall asleep on RM. Just show how tired she was at that time. Happy for her because she is busy with work that she loves (acting). Though kinda worry due to her history of collapse due to exhaustion. Hopefull she get enough rest.",

So actually she has been filming 2 projects at the same time back to back, not including Running Man. \n\nI am happy for her but also would love for her to get a little rest soon. Saw her at the Golden Disc Awards 2022 and in the photos her eyes looked tired. Besides everything she has going on, it amazes me how energetic and involved she still is on Running Man. Never have I seen her complain or look like she doesn\u2019t want to be there. She provides quality content no matter what she has going on. \n\nYes, I notice sometimes that she is tired by the bags in her eyes but she never made me think she wasn\u2019t putting in effort. She\u2019s an amazing person, and even when her grandmother passed away (late 2021 - mentioned in KBS Awards 2021) she never exposed her pain. I admire her so much. If 2021 was good, 2022 will be great for Jeon SoMin.",

For example, if they filmed every Monday and one crew member suddenly gets covid, so they had to postpone their shoot for the following weeks and would have stopped broadcasting (since there isn't enough footage).\n\n But if they filmed bi-weekly (leaving the next week as a day-off or something), better chances that if one crew tested positive sometime before the next shooting, it would be easier for them since they already have filmed prior. And would give enough time for the staff and members to recover/isolate/self quarantine before the next shooting. \n\nNot sure if I phrased it right lol.",

But around that time, she did feel frustrated with her acting career (refer to phone call between her and Haha+JK on a MUD episode early 2020). She also went hiking few days before she collapsed. It could be purely because she really exhausted from that hiking. Plus emotional exhaustion from her stagnant acting career. Also, around that time, her contract with her former management company almost ended. This surely add to her worry. \n\nTo say she collapsed solely due to cyberbullying, I doubt it. But if if is one of the reasons, maybe. \n\nEdit: add some more sentences.",
