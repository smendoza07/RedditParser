Carry permits for restricted firearms are only given to those who require it for work and a select few who the government feel live in an area where grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nThe vets here have nothing to do with licensing and do not care if your dogs are licensed. One person at the dog park had Toronto Animal Services retrieve their dog when it escaped their yard. The dog was microchipped so they were able to contact her. When she went to pick up her dog they made her license him, which is only good for one year. She did not renew the next year. \n\nThe only other person I\u2019ve talked to at the dog park who has had a dog that was licensed at the time of me speaking to them was someone who had gotten their first dog and thought it was something everyone did. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that no one ever licenses their dogs. But the vast majority of dog owners do not, and the city knows it\u2019s an issue. Every couple years the municipal government releases a statement about how pet licensing has decreased and bylaw enforcement will increase and start showing up at parks to check licenses. I guess that scares enough people into paying to fund their budget.\n\nI am not \u201canti-licensing\u201d or anything like that. I have a driver\u2019s license, a firearms license, a fishing license, a hunting license, and a professional engineer\u2019s license. I also have PMP certification, and six sigma black belt certification. I recognize the difference between licensing and certification. I would prefer my barber have certification of barber-specific training than a license that indicates that they know what the municipal government thinks they should know.",

Don\u2019t even worry about the refund at this point. Go to a reputable hairstylist and ask them for advice and if it\u2019s agreeable to you then go with it. YMMV, but in my experience female hairstylists tend to do a way better job than their male counterparts *cough* they have a better sense of style *cough*\n\nOptional: Wait 2 weeks and you could buzz it to a guard longer than 0",

Carry permits for restricted firearms are only given to those who require it for work and a select few who the government feel live in an area where grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nThe vets here have nothing to do with licensing and do not care if your dogs are licensed. One person at the dog park had Toronto Animal Services retrieve their dog when it escaped their yard. The dog was microchipped so they were able to contact her. When she went to pick up her dog they made her license him, which is only good for one year. She did not renew the next year. \n\nThe only other person I\u2019ve talked to at the dog park who has had a dog that was licensed at the time of me speaking to them was someone who had gotten their first dog and thought it was something everyone did. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that no one ever licenses their dogs. But the vast majority of dog owners do not, and the city knows it\u2019s an issue. Every couple years the municipal government releases a statement about how pet licensing has decreased and bylaw enforcement will increase and start showing up at parks to check licenses. I guess that scares enough people into paying to fund their budget.\n\nI am not \u201canti-licensing\u201d or anything like that. I have a driver\u2019s license, a firearms license, a fishing license, a hunting license, and a professional engineer\u2019s license. I also have PMP certification, and six sigma black belt certification. I recognize the difference between licensing and certification. I would prefer my barber have certification of barber-specific training than a license that indicates that they know what the municipal government thinks they should know.",

Carry permits for restricted firearms are only given to those who require it for work and a select few who the government feel live in an area where grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nThe vets here have nothing to do with licensing and do not care if your dogs are licensed. One person at the dog park had Toronto Animal Services retrieve their dog when it escaped their yard. The dog was microchipped so they were able to contact her. When she went to pick up her dog they made her license him, which is only good for one year. She did not renew the next year. \n\nThe only other person I\u2019ve talked to at the dog park who has had a dog that was licensed at the time of me speaking to them was someone who had gotten their first dog and thought it was something everyone did. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that no one ever licenses their dogs. But the vast majority of dog owners do not, and the city knows it\u2019s an issue. Every couple years the municipal government releases a statement about how pet licensing has decreased and bylaw enforcement will increase and start showing up at parks to check licenses. I guess that scares enough people into paying to fund their budget.\n\nI am not \u201canti-licensing\u201d or anything like that. I have a driver\u2019s license, a firearms license, a fishing license, a hunting license, and a professional engineer\u2019s license. I also have PMP certification, and six sigma black belt certification. I recognize the difference between licensing and certification. I would prefer my barber have certification of barber-specific training than a license that indicates that they know what the municipal government thinks they should know.",

Carry permits for restricted firearms are only given to those who require it for work and a select few who the government feel live in an area where grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nThe vets here have nothing to do with licensing and do not care if your dogs are licensed. One person at the dog park had Toronto Animal Services retrieve their dog when it escaped their yard. The dog was microchipped so they were able to contact her. When she went to pick up her dog they made her license him, which is only good for one year. She did not renew the next year. \n\nThe only other person I\u2019ve talked to at the dog park who has had a dog that was licensed at the time of me speaking to them was someone who had gotten their first dog and thought it was something everyone did. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that no one ever licenses their dogs. But the vast majority of dog owners do not, and the city knows it\u2019s an issue. Every couple years the municipal government releases a statement about how pet licensing has decreased and bylaw enforcement will increase and start showing up at parks to check licenses. I guess that scares enough people into paying to fund their budget.\n\nI am not \u201canti-licensing\u201d or anything like that. I have a driver\u2019s license, a firearms license, a fishing license, a hunting license, and a professional engineer\u2019s license. I also have PMP certification, and six sigma black belt certification. I recognize the difference between licensing and certification. I would prefer my barber have certification of barber-specific training than a license that indicates that they know what the municipal government thinks they should know.",

He's a huge piece of shit, and the fact that he somehow was able to run that school is proof enough for me that the system for these licenses is broken. I'm sure there are good schools though, but for the most part... worthless certificate that tells you nothing about someones actual skill.",

Carry permits for restricted firearms are only given to those who require it for work and a select few who the government feel live in an area where grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nThe vets here have nothing to do with licensing and do not care if your dogs are licensed. One person at the dog park had Toronto Animal Services retrieve their dog when it escaped their yard. The dog was microchipped so they were able to contact her. When she went to pick up her dog they made her license him, which is only good for one year. She did not renew the next year. \n\nThe only other person I\u2019ve talked to at the dog park who has had a dog that was licensed at the time of me speaking to them was someone who had gotten their first dog and thought it was something everyone did. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that no one ever licenses their dogs. But the vast majority of dog owners do not, and the city knows it\u2019s an issue. Every couple years the municipal government releases a statement about how pet licensing has decreased and bylaw enforcement will increase and start showing up at parks to check licenses. I guess that scares enough people into paying to fund their budget.\n\nI am not \u201canti-licensing\u201d or anything like that. I have a driver\u2019s license, a firearms license, a fishing license, a hunting license, and a professional engineer\u2019s license. I also have PMP certification, and six sigma black belt certification. I recognize the difference between licensing and certification. I would prefer my barber have certification of barber-specific training than a license that indicates that they know what the municipal government thinks they should know.",

Carry permits for restricted firearms are only given to those who require it for work and a select few who the government feel live in an area where grizzly bears are a threat.\n\nThe vets here have nothing to do with licensing and do not care if your dogs are licensed. One person at the dog park had Toronto Animal Services retrieve their dog when it escaped their yard. The dog was microchipped so they were able to contact her. When she went to pick up her dog they made her license him, which is only good for one year. She did not renew the next year. \n\nThe only other person I\u2019ve talked to at the dog park who has had a dog that was licensed at the time of me speaking to them was someone who had gotten their first dog and thought it was something everyone did. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that no one ever licenses their dogs. But the vast majority of dog owners do not, and the city knows it\u2019s an issue. Every couple years the municipal government releases a statement about how pet licensing has decreased and bylaw enforcement will increase and start showing up at parks to check licenses. I guess that scares enough people into paying to fund their budget.\n\nI am not \u201canti-licensing\u201d or anything like that. I have a driver\u2019s license, a firearms license, a fishing license, a hunting license, and a professional engineer\u2019s license. I also have PMP certification, and six sigma black belt certification. I recognize the difference between licensing and certification. I would prefer my barber have certification of barber-specific training than a license that indicates that they know what the municipal government thinks they should know.",
