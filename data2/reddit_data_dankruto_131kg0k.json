When his ability is introduced he\u2019s new at using it and as the show goes on he clearly gets better and better at using it. On top of that he gets his chakra restored a few times during the war arc and I\u2019m pretty sure he started losing his eye sight during the war. Sakura who was not shown or stated to be training at all post 2nd bell exam with naruto was suddenly buffed to an extreme degree able to hurt Kaguya who I think was stated to be immortal. \n\nI\u2019m not a Sakura hater I like the character and I don\u2019t even mind that she had a hand in defeating Kaguya. It was just definitely a plot thing exclusively. Even her standing with them and saying she can hold her own was more like a callback to the Sanin and an acknowledgment that the Sakura who couldn\u2019t do anything was gone. She\u2019s not actually comparable to those two in power in any way.",

Obito at that point has the same chakra that Hagoromo had. He didn\u2019t have nearly the same amount or mastery over it. But Hagoromo gave Sasuke an eye and gave naruto sage powers. Hagoromo showed he can\u2019t stay in their world forever and his powers would run out eventually and he\u2019d have to return to the pure lands. It\u2019s the exact same thing Obito did but Obito could only do it for a much much shorter amount of time. So no kakashi did make sense throughout the war arc. You may not have liked it. A lot of people may not have liked it but a lot of what happens is explainable. Things like Sakura with low chakra being able to damage the immortal Kaguya doesn\u2019t make much sense at all. There\u2019s a huge difference.",

You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed. Because that was only the solution mainly due to the Charles fruit.\n\nThe only Otushiki to be defeated and killed are Momoshiki and Isshin. Momoshiki due to Boruto. Which lets be fair Momo was seriously weak considering how Naruto and Sasuke were kicking his butt. \n\nIsshin took Sasuke\u2019s Rinnesharigan, Baryon Mode, and Kawaki\u2019s quick thinking with clone jutsu.  \n\n\nI\u2019m curious how a Baryon mode Naruto would fair against Kaguya.",

There are a lot of plot-buffs in this series, not to mention plot convenience. \n\nNaruto has been carried by the strongest tailed beast who outright feeds him enough chakra to survive in literally every fight (other than the non-serious battles like Naruto farting in Kiba\u2019s face on two separate occasions), he was born as the overpowered reincarnation of Ashura, he was born in the overpowered Uzumaki Clan, he had the leftover essence of his dead parents available to guide him on the right path when the time was right, and he was born with many connections from birth that would benefit him in the future as the son of the Fourth Hokage, among other things. \n\nSakura just worked hard.\n\nI see Sakura, who trained with the strongest woman known at the time other than Kaguya, being relevant against Kaguya as an acceptable, believable occurrence in comparison to some of the contrived plot elements that founded this series.\n\nNgl I didn\u2019t even watch the Kaguya fight; I\u2019ve just heard of it. As soon as Naruto & Sasuke were blatantly given the ability to compete with the final villains, I lost all investment in the 4th War. The stakes felt so artificial, especially since I was rooting for the villains.\n\nI watched Naruto VS Sasuke after that, Sasuke\u2019s few scenes in Naruto: The Last, Fused Momoshiki VS Naruto & Sasuke, and that\u2019s it. Plot buffs and this series go hand-in-hand.",

What I mentioned exists in the realm of very blatant narrative handouts from Hagoromo\u2019s early birthday present to Naruto & Sasuke, to Kurama being Naruto\u2019s safety net and lifeblood, to ghost parents guiding Naruto, to him being born in a powerful clan, esc. \n\nThese are unnatural, outside influences given to Naruto. It\u2019s not the same as you thinking she shouldn\u2019t be able to hit so hard, because by that logic, neither should base Naruto against Neji or even Karui when she beat Naruto down.\n\nThe entire bottom line of the Naruto series is that the protagonists must win against powerful foes, the average Shounen foundation, so the entire plot is forced in that sense.",

That was naruto enhanced by Kurama that one shotted neji as naruto couldn't even access his Chakra at that pt due to neji sealing off his Chakra pts. You can argue that's not really a plot buff too. That's the first time we see neji get a clean hit landed on him during that entire fight and he had been exhausting his Chakra up to that pt using the rotation and defending himself from naruto. If anything, that's just an anti feat for neji's durability and Chakra reserves because we know that ninja cannot continue to move with low Chakra and if they exhaust their low Chakra even further they'll die",

Royalty is used to describe people and objects related to a monarch, who rules a monarchy. So Princess Diana was royalty, but then First Lady Barbara Bush was not.\n\nThe Kazekage is elected by the village's council. Also, the village(honestly it should be called a city) is really still just a human settlement, a part of the actual nation called Land of Wind ruled by the Daimyo, and none any higher than him.\n\nBut I hesitate to call the Daimyo the royalty either. Historically (as in irl history) Daimyo is still two positions below an individual known as the Emperor, whom he and his family would be called Royal or even Imperial. But Emperors and Shoguns do not seem to be a thing in this world, as seen in the 4th Shinobi War where Daimyos were the highest priorty.\n\nSo, it seems like 'Royalty' in the strictest sense of the word, is not even a thing in this world.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

He just drew the covers and JUMP included them in the official timeline. if you really think they're not canon, suit yourself. I personally trust official JUMP timeline more than a random redditor who thinks spinoffs=non-canon\n\n>Even movies can be fitted in timelines.

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

But assuming it's correct.\n\n[Here's a mirror.](https://i.imgur.com/eyPC6yV.jpg)\n\n>Why would Kishimoto draw all the characters with their respective clan symbols behind them, but put a random symbol on Sakura?\n\nI addressed this in point 1 of my response.\n\n>And it would be a random symbol, all the characters have their specific clan symbols, and she would just have a random design in this scene, which would make no sense.\n\nAgain, you've ignored my point and simply repeated yourself: *it's not random.* It's part of her character design. You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

Sakura who was not shown or stated to be training at all post 2nd bell exam with naruto was suddenly buffed to an extreme degree able to hurt Kaguya who I think was stated to be immortal. \n\nI\u2019m not a Sakura hater I like the character and I don\u2019t even mind that she had a hand in defeating Kaguya. It was just definitely a plot thing exclusively. Even her standing with them and saying she can hold her own was more like a callback to the Sanin and an acknowledgment that the Sakura who couldn\u2019t do anything was gone. She\u2019s not actually comparable to those two in power in any way.",

Obito at that point has the same chakra that Hagoromo had. He didn\u2019t have nearly the same amount or mastery over it. But Hagoromo gave Sasuke an eye and gave naruto sage powers. Hagoromo showed he can\u2019t stay in their world forever and his powers would run out eventually and he\u2019d have to return to the pure lands. It\u2019s the exact same thing Obito did but Obito could only do it for a much much shorter amount of time. So no kakashi did make sense throughout the war arc. You may not have liked it. A lot of people may not have liked it but a lot of what happens is explainable. Things like Sakura with low chakra being able to damage the immortal Kaguya doesn\u2019t make much sense at all. There\u2019s a huge difference.",

I think it would be the same if it was Madara (if we ignore his Limbo Clone that is). I mean Sakura would have gotten destroyed by normal Madara. Kaguya seemed to be more of a long range fighter with Black ZETSU as as support. I\u2019m not sure if I had seen any Close Combat compared to say Madara fights.  You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed. Because that was only the solution mainly due to the Charles fruit.\n\nThe only Otushiki to be defeated and killed are Momoshiki and Isshin. Momoshiki due to Boruto. Which lets be fair Momo was seriously weak considering how Naruto and Sasuke were kicking his butt. \n\nIsshin took Sasuke\u2019s Rinnesharigan, Baryon Mode, and Kawaki\u2019s quick thinking with clone jutsu.  \n\n\nI\u2019m curious how a Baryon mode Naruto would fair against Kaguya.",

There are a lot of plot-buffs in this series, not to mention plot convenience. \n\nNaruto has been carried by the strongest tailed beast who outright feeds him enough chakra to survive in literally every fight (other than the non-serious battles like Naruto farting in Kiba\u2019s face on two separate occasions), he was born as the overpowered reincarnation of Ashura, he was born in the overpowered Uzumaki Clan, he had the leftover essence of his dead parents available to guide him on the right path when the time was right, and he was born with many connections from birth that would benefit him in the future as the son of the Fourth Hokage, among other things. \n\nSakura just worked hard.\n\nI see Sakura, who trained with the strongest woman known at the time other than Kaguya, being relevant against Kaguya as an acceptable, believable occurrence in comparison to some of the contrived plot elements that founded this series.\n\nNgl I didn\u2019t even watch the Kaguya fight; I\u2019ve just heard of it. As soon as Naruto & Sasuke were blatantly given the ability to compete with the final villains, I lost all investment in the 4th War.

Uzumaki are not that strong just like uchia are not that strong, out of the entire history of this entire clan we've gotten like 5 god level characters. Uchia aren't just born gods and neither are the uzumaki, what makes the uzumaki so dangerous (to the point where they were literally wiped out while the uchia were allowed to continue) is that they have just absolutely absurd amounts of chakra (which is why they were always chosen to be the villages jinchuriki since they were the only ones who wouldn't die if the beast was extracted), and iirc they have an affinity for sage mode, but that second one could be me mixing up the uzumaki and the senju.",

But I still think it's nonsensical for Sakura to be anywhere near kaguya's level. As a matter of fact, anyone near that level has been given powers ups in some fashion, but Sakura is able to temporarily reach that power with no explanation. Like someone before me said, it would of been better if Sakura had actually received some type of power up or at least been shown training more than to have it be the way the series portrayed it because the whole thing is non sensical.",

Royalty is used to describe people and objects related to a monarch, who rules a monarchy. So Princess Diana was royalty, but then First Lady Barbara Bush was not.\n\nThe Kazekage is elected by the village's council. Also, the village(honestly it should be called a city) is really still just a human settlement, a part of the actual nation called Land of Wind ruled by the Daimyo, and none any higher than him.\n\nBut I hesitate to call the Daimyo the royalty either. Historically (as in irl history) Daimyo is still two positions below an individual known as the Emperor, whom he and his family would be called Royal or even Imperial. But Emperors and Shoguns do not seem to be a thing in this world, as seen in the 4th Shinobi War where Daimyos were the highest priorty.\n\nSo, it seems like 'Royalty' in the strictest sense of the word, is not even a thing in this world.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

He just drew the covers and JUMP included them in the official timeline. if you really think they're not canon, suit yourself. I personally trust official JUMP timeline more than a random redditor who thinks spinoffs=non-canon\n\n>Even movies can be fitted in timelines. Doesnt make them so either.\n\nI don't see a single movie here, except canon The Last and Naruto:Boruto the movie. I wonder why\n\n>And the author of the novels did not say \"spinoff\"\n\n[sure](https://twitter.com/Jun_Esaka/status/1157254301103747074?s=19)",

To my knowledge, they have never appeared in the canon anime either, only in a filler episode that was meant to promote Road to Ninja or something.\n\n>The Haruno Clan symbol also appears in some manga panels.\n\nI've read the manga, and her family is almost never discussed at all, so when would this have happened?\n\n>There is also an official drawing made by Kishimoto where he draws the entire team 7 and behind team 7 is the symbol of the clan of each member of team 7: Behind Sasuke is the symbol of the Uchiha, behind Naruto is the symbol of Uzumaki, and behind Sakura is the Haruno symbol.\n\nWould you be able to link it?

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed. Because that was only the solution mainly due to the Charles fruit.\n\nThe only Otushiki to be defeated and killed are Momoshiki and Isshin. Momoshiki due to Boruto. Which lets be fair Momo was seriously weak considering how Naruto and Sasuke were kicking his butt. \n\nIsshin took Sasuke\u2019s Rinnesharigan, Baryon Mode, and Kawaki\u2019s quick thinking with clone jutsu.  \n\n\nI\u2019m curious how a Baryon mode Naruto would fair against Kaguya.",

There are a lot of plot-buffs in this series, not to mention plot convenience. \n\nNaruto has been carried by the strongest tailed beast who outright feeds him enough chakra to survive in literally every fight (other than the non-serious battles like Naruto farting in Kiba\u2019s face on two separate occasions), he was born as the overpowered reincarnation of Ashura, he was born in the overpowered Uzumaki Clan, he had the leftover essence of his dead parents available to guide him on the right path when the time was right, and he was born with many connections from birth that would benefit him in the future as the son of the Fourth Hokage, among other things. \n\nSakura just worked hard.\n\nI see Sakura, who trained with the strongest woman known at the time other than Kaguya, being relevant against Kaguya as an acceptable, believable occurrence in comparison to some of the contrived plot elements that founded this series.\n\nNgl I didn\u2019t even watch the Kaguya fight; I\u2019ve just heard of it.

What I mentioned exists in the realm of very blatant narrative handouts from Hagoromo\u2019s early birthday present to Naruto & Sasuke, to Kurama being Naruto\u2019s safety net and lifeblood, to ghost parents guiding Naruto, to him being born in a powerful clan, esc. \n\nThese are unnatural, outside influences given to Naruto. It\u2019s not the same as you thinking she shouldn\u2019t be able to hit so hard, because by that logic, neither should base Naruto against Neji or even Karui when she beat Naruto down.\n\nThe entire bottom line of the Naruto series is that the protagonists must win against powerful foes, the average Shounen foundation, so the entire plot is forced in that sense.",

That was naruto enhanced by Kurama that one shotted neji as naruto couldn't even access his Chakra at that pt due to neji sealing off his Chakra pts. You can argue that's not really a plot buff too. That's the first time we see neji get a clean hit landed on him during that entire fight and he had been exhausting his Chakra up to that pt using the rotation and defending himself from naruto. If anything, that's just an anti feat for neji's durability and Chakra reserves because we know that ninja cannot continue to move with low Chakra and if they exhaust their low Chakra even further they'll die",

Yeah they're stated to have large amounts of Chakra and a large life-force but if you're going to complain about that than non of the clans get to have anything unique besides their names.",

As a matter of fact, anyone near that level has been given powers ups in some fashion, but Sakura is able to temporarily reach that power with no explanation.

Royalty is used to describe people and objects related to a monarch, who rules a monarchy. So Princess Diana was royalty, but then First Lady Barbara Bush was not.\n\nThe Kazekage is elected by the village's council. Also, the village(honestly it should be called a city) is really still just a human settlement, a part of the actual nation called Land of Wind ruled by the Daimyo, and none any higher than him.\n\nBut I hesitate to call the Daimyo the royalty either. Historically (as in irl history) Daimyo is still two positions below an individual known as the Emperor, whom he and his family would be called Royal or even Imperial. But Emperors and Shoguns do not seem to be a thing in this world, as seen in the 4th Shinobi War where Daimyos were the highest priorty.\n\nSo, it seems like 'Royalty' in the strictest sense of the word, is not even a thing in this world.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

Sakura who was not shown or stated to be training at all post 2nd bell exam with naruto was suddenly buffed to an extreme degree able to hurt Kaguya who I think was stated to be immortal. \n\nI\u2019m not a Sakura hater I like the character and I don\u2019t even mind that she had a hand in defeating Kaguya. It was just definitely a plot thing exclusively. Even her standing with them and saying she can hold her own was more like a callback to the Sanin and an acknowledgment that the Sakura who couldn\u2019t do anything was gone.

Hagoromo showed he can\u2019t stay in their world forever and his powers would run out eventually and he\u2019d have to return to the pure lands. It\u2019s the exact same thing Obito did but Obito could only do it for a much much shorter amount of time. So no kakashi did make sense throughout the war arc. You may not have liked it. A lot of people may not have liked it but a lot of what happens is explainable. Things like Sakura with low chakra being able to damage the immortal Kaguya doesn\u2019t make much sense at all.

You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed.

But I still think it's nonsensical for Sakura to be anywhere near kaguya's level. As a matter of fact, anyone near that level has been given powers ups in some fashion, but Sakura is able to temporarily reach that power with no explanation. Like someone before me said, it would of been better if Sakura had actually received some type of power up or at least been shown training more than to have it be the way the series portrayed it because the whole thing is non sensical.",

So Princess Diana was royalty, but then First Lady Barbara Bush was not.\n\nThe Kazekage is elected by the village's council. Also, the village(honestly it should be called a city) is really still just a human settlement, a part of the actual nation called Land of Wind ruled by the Daimyo, and none any higher than him.\n\nBut I hesitate to call the Daimyo the royalty either. Historically (as in irl history) Daimyo is still two positions below an individual known as the Emperor, whom he and his family would be called Royal or even Imperial. But Emperors and Shoguns do not seem to be a thing in this world, as seen in the 4th Shinobi War where Daimyos were the highest priorty.\n\nSo, it seems like 'Royalty' in the strictest sense of the word, is not even a thing in this world.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

He didn\u2019t have nearly the same amount or mastery over it. But Hagoromo gave Sasuke an eye and gave naruto sage powers. Hagoromo showed he can\u2019t stay in their world forever and his powers would run out eventually and he\u2019d have to return to the pure lands. It\u2019s the exact same thing Obito did but Obito could only do it for a much much shorter amount of time. So no kakashi did make sense throughout the war arc. You may not have liked it. A lot of people may not have liked it but a lot of what happens is explainable. Things like Sakura with low chakra being able to damage the immortal Kaguya doesn\u2019t make much sense at all. There\u2019s a huge difference.",

What I mentioned exists in the realm of very blatant narrative handouts from Hagoromo\u2019s early birthday present to Naruto & Sasuke, to Kurama being Naruto\u2019s safety net and lifeblood, to ghost parents guiding Naruto, to him being born in a powerful clan, esc. \n\nThese are unnatural, outside influences given to Naruto. It\u2019s not the same as you thinking she shouldn\u2019t be able to hit so hard, because by that logic, neither should base Naruto against Neji or even Karui when she beat Naruto down.\n\nThe entire bottom line of the Naruto series is that the protagonists must win against powerful foes, the average Shounen foundation, so the entire plot is forced in that sense.",

That was naruto enhanced by Kurama that one shotted neji as naruto couldn't even access his Chakra at that pt due to neji sealing off his Chakra pts. You can argue that's not really a plot buff too. That's the first time we see neji get a clean hit landed on him during that entire fight and he had been exhausting his Chakra up to that pt using the rotation and defending himself from naruto. If anything, that's just an anti feat for neji's durability and Chakra reserves because we know that ninja cannot continue to move with low Chakra and if they exhaust their low Chakra even further they'll die",

Uchia aren't just born gods and neither are the uzumaki, what makes the uzumaki so dangerous (to the point where they were literally wiped out while the uchia were allowed to continue) is that they have just absolutely absurd amounts of chakra (which is why they were always chosen to be the villages jinchuriki since they were the only ones who wouldn't die if the beast was extracted), and iirc they have an affinity for sage mode, but that second one could be me mixing up the uzumaki and the senju.",

Also, the village(honestly it should be called a city) is really still just a human settlement, a part of the actual nation called Land of Wind ruled by the Daimyo, and none any higher than him.\n\nBut I hesitate to call the Daimyo the royalty either. Historically (as in irl history) Daimyo is still two positions below an individual known as the Emperor, whom he and his family would be called Royal or even Imperial. But Emperors and Shoguns do not seem to be a thing in this world, as seen in the 4th Shinobi War where Daimyos were the highest priorty.\n\nSo, it seems like 'Royalty' in the strictest sense of the word, is not even a thing in this world.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

But assuming it's correct.\n\n[Here's a mirror.](https://i.imgur.com/eyPC6yV.jpg)\n\n>Why would Kishimoto draw all the characters with their respective clan symbols behind them, but put a random symbol on Sakura?\n\nI addressed this in point 1 of my response.\n\n>And it would be a random symbol, all the characters have their specific clan symbols, and she would just have a random design in this scene, which would make no sense.\n\nAgain, you've ignored my point and simply repeated yourself: *it's not random.* It's part of her character design. You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

I\u2019m not sure if I had seen any Close Combat compared to say Madara fights.  You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed. Because that was only the solution mainly due to the Charles fruit.\n\nThe only Otushiki to be defeated and killed are Momoshiki and Isshin. Momoshiki due to Boruto. Which lets be fair Momo was seriously weak considering how Naruto and Sasuke were kicking his butt. \n\nIsshin took Sasuke\u2019s Rinnesharigan, Baryon Mode, and Kawaki\u2019s quick thinking with clone jutsu.  \n\n\nI\u2019m curious how a Baryon mode Naruto would fair against Kaguya.",

What I mentioned exists in the realm of very blatant narrative handouts from Hagoromo\u2019s early birthday present to Naruto & Sasuke, to Kurama being Naruto\u2019s safety net and lifeblood, to ghost parents guiding Naruto, to him being born in a powerful clan, esc. \n\nThese are unnatural, outside influences given to Naruto. It\u2019s not the same as you thinking she shouldn\u2019t be able to hit so hard, because by that logic, neither should base Naruto against Neji or even Karui when she beat Naruto down.\n\nThe entire bottom line of the Naruto series is that the protagonists must win against powerful foes, the average Shounen foundation, so the entire plot is forced in that sense.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design.

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

I\u2019m not sure if I had seen any Close Combat compared to say Madara fights.  You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed. Because that was only the solution mainly due to the Charles fruit.\n\nThe only Otushiki to be defeated and killed are Momoshiki and Isshin. Momoshiki due to Boruto. Which lets be fair Momo was seriously weak considering how Naruto and Sasuke were kicking his butt. \n\nIsshin took Sasuke\u2019s Rinnesharigan, Baryon Mode, and Kawaki\u2019s quick thinking with clone jutsu.  \n\n\nI\u2019m curious how a Baryon mode Naruto would fair against Kaguya.",

What I mentioned exists in the realm of very blatant narrative handouts from Hagoromo\u2019s early birthday present to Naruto & Sasuke, to Kurama being Naruto\u2019s safety net and lifeblood, to ghost parents guiding Naruto, to him being born in a powerful clan, esc. \n\nThese are unnatural, outside influences given to Naruto.

I don't see why families with that much power and history wouldn't be considered nobles when they very often were in real life.\n\n>You wouldn't call the daugher of a mayor \"princess\" would you.\n\n1. I didn't say they'd be royalty, I said they'd be nobles; the \"princess\" thing is probably just a colloquialism.\n\n2. Mayors are usually an aspect of post-feudal societies, and are usually elected or appointed by an elected representative, so it obviously wouldn't apply.\n\nAlso - not important to the point - but it's funny you bring up mayors in particular: the City of London's mayor is actually called the **Lord** Mayor. The post is elected and mostly ceremonial now, but it used to have significant power, and was usually reserved for those who were already rich and powerful, and indeed were often Lords as well.",

That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\nI personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nYou're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

At a stretch, I'd call that supporting evidence, but given that there is literally nothing in canon to go along with it, it's not enough for me.",

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

I\u2019m not sure if I had seen any Close Combat compared to say Madara fights.  You could probably say Kaguya was a Glass Cannon in the sense that she hits like a truck, but she doesn\u2019t have any real defense like Madara does. Even if Kaguya can heal fast, Sakura\u2019s hit on Kaguya was to prevent her from escaping from being sealed. Because that was only the solution mainly due to the Charles fruit.\n\nThe only Otushiki to be defeated and killed are Momoshiki and Isshin. Momoshiki due to Boruto. Which lets be fair Momo was seriously weak considering how Naruto and Sasuke were kicking his butt. \n\nIsshin took Sasuke\u2019s Rinnesharigan, Baryon Mode, and Kawaki\u2019s quick thinking with clone jutsu.  \n\n\nI\u2019m curious how a Baryon mode Naruto would fair against Kaguya.",

Given the militaristic nature of the role - being more analogous a general than anything else - it makes sense that it's not restricted solely to nobility; one of the Kage's most important functions is to be a deterrent to attacks from outside forces, which would be compromised if the office was filled by some noble with no notoriety.\n\nThat said, it wasn't until the Fourth Hokage that a commoner was selected for the position; the first two were Senju, and the Third was from one of the first clans to join Konoha, a student of the previous two Hokage, and had a son in the diamyo's personal guard. In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society? I believe the position of a mayor with all their rights and duties is a rather new one that came to be in our countries thanks to the development of democracy.\n\n... Yes? This is what I was saying - mayors are hallmarks of post-feudal societies, such as democracies. I don't see a contradiction here.\n\n>I personally can vote who gets elected mayor. You can't?\n\nIf you read my comment again, you'll see that I said that while it's an elected position *now*, it wasn't always.\n\n>You're telling me the position of mayor in London is mostly ceremonial? You don't have an actual active mayor who is responsible for the city?\n\n1. I'm not from London, I just mentioned it as an interesting example.  \n2. Lord Mayor of the City of London is a different office from Mayor of London; this is because the City of London is a different jurisdiction within the geographical area of London but administratively separate from what is commonly known as London.

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

In the Fourth's case, he was one of the contributing factors to the Third War ending, and was easily the village's most valuable military asset, so it makes sense that he was chosen.\n\n>That a major is an aspect of a post-feudal society?

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

But assuming it's correct.\n\n[Here's a mirror.](https://i.imgur.com/eyPC6yV.jpg)\n\n>Why would Kishimoto draw all the characters with their respective clan symbols behind them, but put a random symbol on Sakura?\n\nI addressed this in point 1 of my response.\n\n>And it would be a random symbol, all the characters have their specific clan symbols, and she would just have a random design in this scene, which would make no sense.\n\nAgain, you've ignored my point and simply repeated yourself: *it's not random.* It's part of her character design. You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

If so, this really doesn't prove anything, for three reasons:\n\n1. As I mentioned already, the logo could just be there because that's what she has on her dress, and we can assume that she has it on her dress because her mother has something similar too. Why does her mother have it? Two possible reasons: a) it's a clan logo, or b) she just likes the design, or it has some other significance to her. Given that there is literally nothing else in canon or filler that supports option A - not even a throwaway line of dialog referring to Haruno as a clan, which even Jugo's unnamed clan got - option B seems overwhelmingly more likely.\n\n2. The designs are clearly drawn by the characters themselves, and at the time, Naruto has no idea he's part of a clan or that he has any family worth mentioning at all. He likely chose it because it's what's on the Konoha flak jackets, and - more importantly - because it's on his outfit as well. This means that they weren't all drawing clan logos, they were drawing random stuff they liked.\n\n3. The logo in that image isn't even what's on her dress, or her mother's - neither of them have a solid disc in the middle of the circle, and AFAIK none of the iterations of Sakura's outfit have that; if it truly were a clan logo, wouldn't they take more care to render it correctly and more recognizably?\n\nThis isn't even getting into the dubious internal logic of choosing a simple circle for your clan logo - they're supposed to differentiate you from other clans and be instantly recognisable as yours, and this design would completely fail at that.\n\n>Like, Kishimoto correctly and specifically drew the Uchiha and Uzumki symbol behind each character and for Sakura he just put something random?\n\nIt's not random - it's been a consistent part of her character design. That doesn't mean it's emblematic of a clan.",

You're trying to say that it's part of her character design because it's a clan logo, and the reason you give for it being a clan logo is that it's featured prominently in her character design - that's not an argument, that's a tautology.\n\n>No, he's wearing clothes with the correct symbol because Kishimoto drew him, that's pretty simple, what are the chances of him ending up with the wrong symbol? Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",

Extremely high, but he still ends up with the correct choice.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's starting to feel like you didn't read my comment at all. As I said, Naruto drew the symbol because it's on his own clothes and has been since he was a kid, which would make sense to him in-universe because it's part of the jonin uniform, and he's looked up to them and wanted to be part of them all his life. It has nothing to do with it being the Uzumaki clan logo. They're not drawing strictly clan symbols, they're drawing symbols they identify with in some way.\n\nIn fact, this is early enough in the series (chapter 7) that he may not even have conceived of the Uzumaki clan as we currently know it (which would explain the plot hole caused by Naruto being given that name instead of Namikaze).\n\nAlso, this is a nitpick, but if you look at the image, Naruto actually did get the logo slightly wrong, in exactly the way that you'd expect a kid like him to get it wrong, giving further weight to its diegetic nature i.e. not telegraphing from Kishi. If it were messaging of that kind, you'd think he'd have drawn it correctly.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, you still haven't addressed the complete lack of other evidence to support this claim. Do you not think you're ascribing too much meaning to a single early illustration by Kishi? If his intention truly was to establish Haruno as a clan, why wouldn't he have done literally anything else to support that in its 15 years of serialisation? He's thrown out a thousand world-building details about inconsequential nonsense, but ignores this detail about one of the main characters without even giving it lip service? Even when talking specifically about her family in interviews, he's never mentioned the idea of them being a clan.\n\nSo across the manga, anime, filler, spin-offs, games, and Word of God, not once has he ever indicated that that was his intention, but a single drawing with a logo that doesn't even match the one that she usually uses is enough to definitively prove the existence of the Haruno clan? Do you not see how shaky that logic is?\n\n>It has design as bad as this one within the series. This isn't really an argument.\n\nSuch as? Not one other clan design that I'm aware of is anywhere near as generic, except for the Kaguya one, and given its status as (probably) the first ninja clan ever, it makes sense that it doesn't take other clans into account.",
