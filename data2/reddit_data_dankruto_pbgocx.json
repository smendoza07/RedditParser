Anything that happens after that is not part of the fight anymore, it\u2019s just a sneaky move equivalent to Sasuke sneaking on Naruto\u2019s apartment at night and killing him in his sleep or something lol\n\nSasuke just happened to wake up first. I give him credit for the maturity and character integrity of deciding to not do anything to an asleep-Naruto, but I wouldn\u2019t say that means he won the fight.\n\nIdk, that\u2019s just the way I see it lol. But also, if you\u2019re giving Sasuke the victory in part 1 because of that then, for the sake of consistency, you\u2019d have to give Naruto the victory in their last fight lol",

Sasukes feats in shipudden are all mostly old or weakened foes until war arc. Naruto beat nagato at full strength and kakazu is much more dangerous than deidara except for maybe the ultra suicide attack.",

Inazami is in his arsenal too.\n\nItachi has been known to cast genjitsu without actually making eye contact or even weaving hand signs. \n\nRaikage is fast yes, but Sasuke directed REAL lightning at Itachi who was on his deathbed and he managed to counter a lightning strike moving at 1/1000 of a second. \n\nOrochimaru literally was behind him and had the drop on him,  he was going to steal the sharingan. This was the most gifted of Sannin and collector of exotic of forbidden jutsus. ITACHI took his arm instead. \n\nI firmly believe had itachi not fallen I'll he would have continued to be the greatest ninja of all time but even better than that.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Naruto saw that attack and entered panic mode cause he knew he couldn\u2019t defend against it himself. For the first time Kuruma gave Naruto so much chakra he had to hibernate after\u2026 you do know they share chakra right? If Kuruma is done that means Naruto is reaching his limits too. You was probably expecting Naruto to pull another power from out his ass and win huh? If he was really holding back at that moment there would\u2019ve been no need too he could\u2019ve won the clash Sasuke prolly wouldn\u2019t have died since they both managed to survive that explosion and that would\u2019ve been it.

Anything that happens after that is not part of the fight anymore, it\u2019s just a sneaky move equivalent to Sasuke sneaking on Naruto\u2019s apartment at night and killing him in his sleep or something lol\n\nSasuke just happened to wake up first. I give him credit for the maturity and character integrity of deciding to not do anything to an asleep-Naruto, but I wouldn\u2019t say that means he won the fight.\n\nIdk, that\u2019s just the way I see it lol.

It's was supposed to show the strength of Orochimarus power and this was only the start. He gained this immense power by getting carried in a box for a day. How much could he gain in 2 years? It was the reason he thought he has to go to Oro for power, as he won the fight against his counterpart who d rather stay in the leaf.",

Sasukes feats in shipudden are all mostly old or weakened foes until war arc. Naruto beat nagato at full strength and kakazu is much more dangerous than deidara except for maybe the ultra suicide attack.",

Most likely the the moment the Raikage blitzed Itachi , would be the moment before he realized itachi had him in a genjitsu from the time he arrived and noticed Itachi. He loves doing that shit. Dude expects shit years In advance and makes plans.\n\nHow does raikage deal with Yata mirror and sword of tosuka? Inazami is in his arsenal too.\n\nItachi has been known to cast genjitsu without actually making eye contact or even weaving hand signs. \n\nRaikage is fast yes, but Sasuke directed REAL lightning at Itachi who was on his deathbed and he managed to counter a lightning strike moving at 1/1000 of a second. \n\nOrochimaru literally was behind him and had the drop on him,  he was going to steal the sharingan. This was the most gifted of Sannin and collector of exotic of forbidden jutsus. ITACHI took his arm instead. \n\nI firmly believe had itachi not fallen I'll he would have continued to be the greatest ninja of all time but even better than that.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

You can either say both were a tie, or give Sasuke the win in part 1 and Naruto the win in the second fight.\n\nThe ending was literally exactly the same in both fights. They both use their final move and then get completely knocked out. In part 1, Sasuke wakes up first. In the second fight, Naruto wakes up first.\n\nIt\u2019s literally the same thing. Giving any of them a win in one fight and then saying the other fight was a tie is just a fanboy move.",

Sasukes feats in shipudden are all mostly old or weakened foes until war arc. Naruto beat nagato at full strength and kakazu is much more dangerous than deidara except for maybe the ultra suicide attack.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Naruto saw that attack and entered panic mode cause he knew he couldn\u2019t defend against it himself. For the first time Kuruma gave Naruto so much chakra he had to hibernate after\u2026 you do know they share chakra right? If Kuruma is done that means Naruto is reaching his limits too. You was probably expecting Naruto to pull another power from out his ass and win huh? If he was really holding back at that moment there would\u2019ve been no need too he could\u2019ve won the clash Sasuke prolly wouldn\u2019t have died since they both managed to survive that explosion and that would\u2019ve been it.

Anything that happens after that is not part of the fight anymore, it\u2019s just a sneaky move equivalent to Sasuke sneaking on Naruto\u2019s apartment at night and killing him in his sleep or something lol\n\nSasuke just happened to wake up first. I give him credit for the maturity and character integrity of deciding to not do anything to an asleep-Naruto, but I wouldn\u2019t say that means he won the fight.\n\nIdk, that\u2019s just the way I see it lol.

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

For the first time Kuruma gave Naruto so much chakra he had to hibernate after\u2026 you do know they share chakra right? If Kuruma is done that means Naruto is reaching his limits too. You was probably expecting Naruto to pull another power from out his ass and win huh? If he was really holding back at that moment there would\u2019ve been no need too he could\u2019ve won the clash Sasuke prolly wouldn\u2019t have died since they both managed to survive that explosion and that would\u2019ve been it.

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

For the first time Kuruma gave Naruto so much chakra he had to hibernate after\u2026 you do know they share chakra right? If Kuruma is done that means Naruto is reaching his limits too. You was probably expecting Naruto to pull another power from out his ass and win huh? If he was really holding back at that moment there would\u2019ve been no need too he could\u2019ve won the clash Sasuke prolly wouldn\u2019t have died since they both managed to survive that explosion and that would\u2019ve been it.

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

It's coherent, unlike that theory you're trying to prove true. We can talk later if you want lol but now I'll be busy",

For the first time Kuruma gave Naruto so much chakra he had to hibernate after\u2026 you do know they share chakra right? If Kuruma is done that means Naruto is reaching his limits too. You was probably expecting Naruto to pull another power from out his ass and win huh? If he was really holding back at that moment there would\u2019ve been no need too he could\u2019ve won the clash Sasuke prolly wouldn\u2019t have died since they both managed to survive that explosion and that would\u2019ve been it.

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan.

The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Naruto saw that attack and entered panic mode cause he knew he couldn\u2019t defend against it himself. For the first time Kuruma gave Naruto so much chakra he had to hibernate after\u2026 you do know they share chakra right? If Kuruma is done that means Naruto is reaching his limits too. You was probably expecting Naruto to pull another power from out his ass and win huh? If he was really holding back at that moment there would\u2019ve been no need too he could\u2019ve won the clash Sasuke prolly wouldn\u2019t have died since they both managed to survive that explosion and that would\u2019ve been it.

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Hagoromo literally used the Sharingan against his mother, before achieving the Rinnegan awakening.

It's coherent, unlike that theory you're trying to prove true. We can talk later if you want lol but now I'll be busy",

Hagoromo literally used the Sharingan against his mother, before achieving the Rinnegan awakening.

Sasuke got something better, the power of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan in the same eye, while keeping the power of the ems on the other. It's superior, just read it",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Sasuke got something better, the power of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan in the same eye, while keeping the power of the ems on the other. It's superior, just read it",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Hagoromo literally used the Sharingan against his mother, before achieving the Rinnegan awakening. Also, that fake jutsus thing is a lie lmao, you're talking about the unofficial movie kekkei genkais and jutsus that never got confirmed, and when nothing is confirmed, THEY SPECIFY IT. It's coherent, unlike that theory you're trying to prove true. We can talk later if you want lol but now I'll be busy",

            "body": "That's not how it works, that's not how any of this works, Rinnegan never had the power of the Sharingan, nor of the ems, hagoromo couldn't use his Rinnegan as a Sharingan, and neither could kaguya cause she had a rinne Sharingan, an unachievable kekkei mora that didn't have the powers of a simple Rinnegan. The Sharingan was born and passed down from indra and the Rinnegan was passed down through ashura.\n\nWe're looking at completely different lines of evolution that started from individuals that didn't even achieve the power of the fusion of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. It's something that came later with indra's reincarnation fusing its chakra with hagoromo's. The powers of the Tomoe Rinnegan are completely different from perfect Rinnegans like hagoromo's and madara's.\n\nCan't you just inform yourself? I sent you a link that explains it, Jesus christ.",

Also, that fake jutsus thing is a lie lmao, you're talking about the unofficial movie kekkei genkais and jutsus that never got confirmed, and when nothing is confirmed, THEY SPECIFY IT. It's coherent, unlike that theory you're trying to prove true. We can talk later if you want lol but now I'll be busy",
