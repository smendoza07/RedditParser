    "body": "THIS IS LONG, SORRY. Tl;dr--I got so fucking lucky meeting the perfect Daddy at the worst point in my life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have had an exceedingly awful/trying 2020 and 2019. I dated someone who was charming and charismatic, that slowly crept into mental, and then physical abuse. These last two years have eroded my personality and my self-confidence--whittled me down into being a mouse. I have been taught to walk with my eyes downcast, as to look at someone in his presence was disrespectful. I have had monitoring software on my phone that is so pervasive I have given up speaking to friends and family. I had been giving him my paychecks to prove my trust and worthiness. I was nothing; I was no-one. \n\nWhen I was at my lowest, and mentally detached, I joined Seeking to see if there was someone out there who might help me find an apartment. I had no one here. I have no family. I had just moved to California with my (ex) bf. \n\nOver the last two years I have been on Seeking on and off when my ex wanted 'breaks', or when we were over. I have had quite a few lunches and dinners. Some were pleasant, some were not--we all know wading through the dross on seeking is tiresome and defeating sometimes. I had not moved forward with a physical relationship with any of my POT's... none struck me as the kind of relationship I wanted (besides someone I was messaging here on reddit who was a few states north of me). I wanted someone who would be a genuine friend, who would add to my life, not detract from it. I didn't want to be treated as a lesser person, or to be pandered to, or spoken down to. I didnt want to put on an act for a few hours with someone I didnt genuinely like. I have quite enough of that in my personal life. \n\nEnter Nathan (fake name!, I respect his privacy). He lived  north of me, but took the time out of his busy corporate day to drive 45 minutes (one way!) simply to have lunch with me. Over, and over. This stunning, fit man with a foreign accent and piercing blue eyes. He listened to me. He respected that I could not text him at night. He empathized. He helped me realize that my normal was not normal. He was patient. He was my friend. He didn't have to do any of it--he could have simply washed his hands, and in all fairness I wouldn't have blamed him. \n\nHe helped me find an apartment. He sent me $$$$ to help with the down payment. He opened the door to his porsche for me--I sobbed after he did it the first time. I have never had these small kindnesses in my life before... ever. He literally told me \"Listen, Nat, I'm going to remove every barrier you have to leaving this jerk... the only one left will be \\*there\\*\", and gently poked my forehead. \n\n... And that's what he did. I'm half in tears typing this. He celebrates my victories with me. He commiserates over my small defeats. He freely and willingly gives me my fairly high PPM without negotiating me down or making me feel badly about it. He gifts me small things--- He told me recently \"SB's shouldn't be texting their Daddies with green bubbles\" and brought me an iPhone 12. I ride a motorcycle, and am a vehicle enthusiast, and this INCREDIBLE man taught me how to drive a manual in his Porsche 911 as my second  birthday gift. \n\nThis man scooped me up in his truck and DROVE me 6 hours south to have surgery. I was formerly obese, and had saved up money to have implants because I struggle with deflated breasts. I had booked surgery to be one day after my birthday (happy birthday to me!), and my ex was being an asshole to me about it. Nathan booked the hotel, took me to surgery, and then SURPRISE for my birthday... paid for it all. Which is extremely generous, but then spent DAYS with me taking care of me in the sweetest way--much more meaningful to me than just the money. He choo-choo trained me my food when I was in pain and couldnt move. \n\nI can't even, yall. I can't tell you how much this incredibly special man means to me. I'm off to go cry thinking about it. Thank you for reading, thank you for celebrating with me, and if you have any doubts... keep looking. Your person is out there.",
