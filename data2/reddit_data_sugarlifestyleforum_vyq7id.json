    "body": "So I met a guy on Seeking who offered to meet me in a cafe for a M&G and give me $XXX just for the M&G. I was skeptical and didn\u2019t respond to his messages for a while. But then I finally took the leap and met him a few days ago. We connected SO well\u2026fuck\u2026and he said he\u2019d provide XXXX PPM without me even bringing up PPM. \n\nI was super excited after the M&G bc he followed through on the XXX he promised for the M&G. I wanted to share about it earlier but didn\u2019t want to speak too soon.\n\nWell, the next day (literally yesterday lol) we met up for cocktails & a good time and he gave me the XXXX PPM. On top of that, our sexual chemistry - in and out of the bedroom - was off the charts. Then he hit me up AGAIN today and we did cocktails & a good time all over again. And I got ANOTHER XXXX PPM. I didn\u2019t think I was gonna see him for another week, but this was a wonderful surprise.\n\nAll I can say is I\u2019m on a sugar high extraordinaire right now and just wanted to share with people who would be equally excited about this kind of thing. Besides the financial aspect, I find him ridiculously brilliant, engaging, attractive, surprising, and KINKY (lol).  To be mf continued (thank you Seeking??)\u2026 \u2764\ufe0f",

Then maybe three years is a possibility. Do the numbers for yourself.  However a good amount of luck is the third leg of that sugar story and I wish you much of that too. Altogether a great SR can be a very meaningful life relationship despite the cultural frowning. Happy for you!!!",
