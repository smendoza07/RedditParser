    "body": "I have been a long time lurker here and finally decided to make a separate account to post something scary that happened to me. A bit of background, I am a 32 year oldSD that has had a light form of autism and been using SRs as a way to boost my confidence but also gain social interaction skills.\n\nWell I found an SB that is 1 year younger than me who I have met up with and everything seemed to go fine. She was quick to pick up that I am socially challenged and began a slow drip of poison that I didn't pick up on immediately. It was pretty light initially, starting with talking about the difficulties people with autism have when it comes to relationships. It built from there saying how people with autism cannot have friends with neurotypical individuals. To what she said today that autistic individual's best hope was seeking euthanasia. Which at this point I cut my contact with her, including deleting the Google account where my Google Voice number was attached to and starting from new. I began to feel like she wanted to Michelle Carter me. \n\nBefore anyone freaks out, I am not suicidal. Just sharing a recent experience.",

You did this in spite of your disadvantages: autism, and any others you might have that you didnt mention. That's fantastic. Many of us \"normies\" struggle in our careers, love life, and otherwise, despite the fact that we have different advantages and disadvantages.  \n#\nPeople, both in and out of sugar dating will always try to manipulate you. Sometimes its micro level (e.g. getting you to buy something you dont need), and sometimes it will be life threatening.  In or out of sugar dating, dont let the bad guys win man, and take good care of your fellow-traveller good people (sbs and otherwise).",
