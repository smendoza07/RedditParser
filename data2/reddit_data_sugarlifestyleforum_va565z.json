    "body": "Listen, if you\u2019re a SB and you\u2019re sending messages like \u201cmy rate is xxx per hour\u201d you\u2019re going to attract Johns, plain and simple. You won\u2019t be able to find a genuine connection with someone who wants to support you because they care about you. \n\nIn the reverse, if you\u2019re a SD and your attitude is \u201cdinner and hotel for 5 hours for xxx, no extra gifts\u201d the SB you end up with isn\u2019t going to view you as anything more than an ATM, because you\u2019re acting like an ATM. \n\nDon\u2019t come on here and complain that the SB/SD you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t treating you right, when you\u2019re not treating them right either. That\u2019s not how this works. If you\u2019re both in it because you care for the other person, you care about their well-being, and you enjoy your time with them, then you can find really great sugar relationships. If either of you are treating it like a John/Escort thing, that\u2019s what it\u2019ll feel like, that\u2019s what it\u2019ll be. There\u2019s nothing wrong with escorting! But if that\u2019s not the relationship you\u2019re looking for, be careful with how you treat your partner.",
