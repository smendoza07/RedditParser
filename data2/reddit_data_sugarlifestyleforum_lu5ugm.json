    "body": "Hi everyone. I am a 24yr old, 5'7\" slim, attractive female.\nI would've never thought finding a real, legit, (wealthy), sugar daddy would've been so hard considering the amount of messages I get a day. To say it is easy work, is a slap in the face.\n\nLet me give you my take on the site we all probably know and my personal experience, Seeking Arrangements.\nI have exchanged a lot of messages and M&G's with POT daddies over the last two years.\n\nOld Photos, No Photos, Refuse to Show Photos.\nFirst of all, about 50% or more don't have a photo. When asked to provide before speaking more in term of arrangement, I have received responses such as; I don't have photos, but I am definitely attractive or It's better to wait till the M&G (...No.) I've even had one tell me it'll be fun not knowing what he looked like wanting me to show up at his house. The very few others have sent photos through text, but most photos used are atleast 10-20yr old I have noticed when meeting.\n\nPhoto Collectors.\nAnother good chunk of the men are solely photo collectors.\nThey will message you acting as if they are interested in an arrangement, lack to discuss details, start requesting photos, then more, and more. How many photos until you are satisfied?! One in particular I actually somehow managed to meet looking back now. We met for a M&G drinks, hit it off, then got a hotel shortly after. Made plans to see each other again but the very next day he started asking for photos.. not once but twice.. It carried on for days until it was pushing the one week mark with no next meetup planned. I had to stop responding. I don't know about you, but taking \"sexy\" photos all day is the last thing I want to be doing with my \"free time\".\n\nSalt Daddies.\nI'm from North Carolina. From my experience about 99% of the men on the site are about as broke as me. I have been asked to have a quicky in an office for lower than I made in two days at Food Lion with strict instructions, I have been asked to have car sex in a parking lot for a little more than the office dude without even met, I have been asked to use my discussed PPM to pay for the hotel, I have been asked to travel AND have sexual relations without any PPM or allowance, he said in return I'd receive a free trip and a back rub.\nOne lesson/tip I have learned is ALWAYS SET YOUR PPM/ALLOWANCE BEFORE MEETING!! I haven't yet met anyone without discussing this prior, but when I was new I had became a victim of the ole (for example): \"I'll do $$$ to $$$ per meet\", but then gifted the far lower end after, and than again after that. Set your amount and stick to it. Their is no reason you should be gave less than discussed. The ONLY two times I did not, I was burned by receiving less. (my fault for trusting them.)\n\nUnrealistic Expectations.\nI work 35hrs a week and live with my mother in a 2 bedroom single wide. I don't have the time of day, privacy, service/signal, or stamina to FaceTime, Snapchat, call, or text... All. Day. Long.\nMy longest SD relationship was with the most clingiest man I have ever met. He was a singer / song writer and truly insane. I wish I could post his name, but I don't want to be sued like he lived to threaten me. I had to get a second phone to avoid being spammed at work. If I had worked over late and not reply he'd curse me, tell me he was going to sue me for what he had gave, told me he had HIV, awful shit. He'd act as if everything was fine the next day. I could write a novel on the experience with him. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nBoundaries.\nI always set boundaries. In my experience that doesn't mean they won't be crossed, but you definitely should too. I am not comfortable with raw sex or anal sex. That's all. I didn't think it was much or would be a problem. The amount of men that expect raw sex is ridiculous. Anal sex and wanting a 3 way with an imaginary girl I'm supposed to find is tied for second. I just can't. What is so appealing about anal sex? You have your own asshole go play with it! If I state I am not comfortable with it why not find somebody else vs crossing my boundaries or repeatedly asking knowing what I already said. If you have such a big need for it to cross a boundary I think the smart and most logical thing to do would be to find a SB willingly that does it.\n\nTime Wasters.\nThe amount of men that are just looking for drinks, dinner, vanilla dating, with sex added is overflowing as well. It should not take weeks to get to the point. It's almost as annoying as the photo collectors or men thinking you're gonna f*** them for pennies, or in my case, nothing.\n\n\nI can't think of anything else to add, I hope I covered everything I can recall. It may just be where I live.\nI'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable, not putting in enough effort, selfish, or if I just don't have the time or energy to accompany these men the way they need to be.. but this is my take on Sugaring and the website it's self. It's not easy.",

Most of the men in my area that actually are looking to meet in person (excluding all time wasters I mentioned above) either want it free, $150 for in the backseat of a car \"because it's quick\", or an on call emotional support system 24/7. It's just not worth it as the time invested for what 99% of the men in my area can afford I'd make more and save more sanity and time at work, and that's the cold hard truth.",

I expected more maturity from an MD in his 40s",

We will go to a nice restaurant for food and drinks, and I never pressure her to stay over. The guys who do - red flag all around. But yes, I think you should set your PPM before meeting. I personally prefer this because I don\u2019t want her to later hit me with a number that\u2019s unreasonable. \n\nAll in all it comes down to compatibility. I\u2019m not compatible with most SB because many of them want a mega hot guy to pay them just for existing. The ones who I am compatible with, we wind up both happy.",

The quality of men of sugaring sites is generally very poor because they\u2019re not actually interested in sugar dating in any real way. \n\nI had one SD that took me hiking in the mountains and expected intimacy because of it. I\u2019ve been hiking hundreds of times, I can drive to the mountains any time I want and I don\u2019t need a chaperone who I have to pretend is god\u2019s gift to humanity. \n\nCouldn\u2019t move in fast enough after this, but it is very typical of the type of thinking that many men have. \n\nThere is a lot of rude remarks from SDs on SLF who see the words \u201cI know/understand my worth,\u201d as a red flag. In this lifestyle, it is imperative to understand your own worth; otherwise if you define your worth by how men in the bowl treat you...more often than not, you would be worthless. There is never any effort made to understand where this type of language comes from. \n\nLike the man I had a very respectful convo with until he asked me to meet up at a local coffee shop for coffee and a bj. When I declined politely, I was chastised for being a whore and a tease...for not wanting to give a stranger a bj for a cup of coffee. If I wasn\u2019t sure of who I am and what my value is than maybe I would believe the type of things men say in the bowl all the time. \n\nWhen I took the time to figure out what I wanted out of the bowl, I also took the time to figure out what I have to offer an SD. I made an inventory of the qualities that I possess that are of value to the type of men I want an SR with. (I won\u2019t list those because they\u2019re of course subjective.) I know I\u2019m beautiful (to some), but so are so many women in the bowl, so I really had to determine where my value lies in this lifestyle. I\u2019m not an SB in her 20s, so I know that my game and my value must be substantial to shine over the youth of younger SBs. I now therefor understand my value, and I only interact with people who are able to appreciate that value. \n\nMy two cents :)\n\nThanks for posting!!!",

I have have most of my best sugar relationships based off blind dates, because of privacy. I didn\u2019t even share photos of my full face bc it\u2019s not worth risking anyone in my real life finding out about this. If you really want to know to get a clue about what the non- photo sharing POT looks like ask him which celebrity he resembles to get an idea of him. But, I really would not completely cut these guys out.\n\nI suggest you give one of these no picture POTs a chance before you quit the bowl.",

Finding an SB open to intimacy is a million times easier than finding a genuine SD who is not a psycho. Cry me a river\n\nSame for the SDs. Do you know how many babies hop of the rails into crazy town once they settle in? Blackmail, entrapment, false rape accusations. Painting babies as perpetual martyrs are why they are so often taken advantage of. You need to stop spreading this BS and show that we have backbones. We have risks and they do too.

Especially since most are in college so there is always that added risk of flakiness, rinsers, not to mention blackmail/extortion etc.\n\nAnd with the rise of the TikTok babies, these scams are only getting more and more popular thus saturating the bowl with more fake SDs and SBs and making it even more difficult for the genuine ones to find one another.\n\n>I don\u2019t think fighting about who has it worse really helps\n\nYeah, my point was not about who has it better or worse, had he used a different example (such as TSD's unfortunate incident of being robbed at knife point) I would not have left the comment that I did.
