She trained with Neji most of her life, was in the best tracking team for a little while alongside Shino who\u2019s tactical as shit, I\u2019m sure she learned a lot. Pair that up with the fact she survived the war, actually helped Naruto against Pain, knows rotation, air palm and has the god damn byakugan; Sakura would NOT have an easy time dealing with Hinata, cause she is no pushover. At all. I mean she\u2019s the Hokage\u2019s wife and Sakura is the wife of one of the most powerful shinobi. Like I said before it would be a really good fight, the only edge I see for Sakura is her 100healings jutsu and it\u2019s not even a battle power.",

At least Shizune has access to Chakra Scalpels and Poison Mist Jutsu(s?), which is at least a start.\n\n- Kushina has access to Chakra Chains, which are strong enough to capture *bijuu*, if her usage on Kurama in Naruto\u2019s head states anything about how OP they are. And that\u2019s the main thing Sakura struggles with: range. If she can\u2019t get to Kushina, she has no means of dealing with her.

The seal is basically a last-ditch effort to survive, but has a *massive* cooldown due to how much chakra is needed to charge that battery.\n\nAnd sensory jutsu? Really?

Sakura NEEDS to stay melee range to win, her moving away will give Itachi even more advantages. We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi.

She trained with Neji most of her life, was in the best tracking team for a little while alongside Shino who\u2019s tactical as shit, I\u2019m sure she learned a lot. Pair that up with the fact she survived the war, actually helped Naruto against Pain, knows rotation, air palm and has the god damn byakugan; Sakura would NOT have an easy time dealing with Hinata, cause she is no pushover. At all. I mean she\u2019s the Hokage\u2019s wife and Sakura is the wife of one of the most powerful shinobi. Like I said before it would be a really good fight, the only edge I see for Sakura is her 100healings jutsu and it\u2019s not even a battle power.",

At least Shizune has access to Chakra Scalpels and Poison Mist Jutsu(s?), which is at least a start.\n\n- Kushina has access to Chakra Chains, which are strong enough to capture *bijuu*, if her usage on Kurama in Naruto\u2019s head states anything about how OP they are. And that\u2019s the main thing Sakura struggles with: range. If she can\u2019t get to Kushina, she has no means of dealing with her. Not to mention, they both have access to super strength, so Kushina can handle herself in close combat and ranged combat, something Sakura will undoubtedly struggle against.",

The seal is basically a last-ditch effort to survive, but has a *massive* cooldown due to how much chakra is needed to charge that battery.\n\nAnd sensory jutsu? Really? Is that really that impressive? If Ino of all people can use it, and both Naruto and Sasuke have permanent access to it in the form of their Six Paths forms, it isn\u2019t very noteworthy or useful if she can\u2019t react to what she senses fast enough.",

Sakura have no endurance or chakra problems she was able to dodge a bijuu bomb heal the whole shinobi alliance and replenish their chakra reserve\nI dont think dodging a slow sword is going to be a problem\nAmaterasu need to be charged and again sakura could dodge it with no problem since she was able to react to a bijuu bomb and kaguya chakra arm who was considered fast by SPSM naruto\nShe can also destroy the susano with 3 punchs maximum",

The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

She trained with Neji most of her life, was in the best tracking team for a little while alongside Shino who\u2019s tactical as shit, I\u2019m sure she learned a lot. Pair that up with the fact she survived the war, actually helped Naruto against Pain, knows rotation, air palm and has the god damn byakugan; Sakura would NOT have an easy time dealing with Hinata, cause she is no pushover. At all. I mean she\u2019s the Hokage\u2019s wife and Sakura is the wife of one of the most powerful shinobi. Like I said before it would be a really good fight, the only edge I see for Sakura is her 100healings jutsu and it\u2019s not even a battle power.",

The seal is basically a last-ditch effort to survive, but has a *massive* cooldown due to how much chakra is needed to charge that battery.\n\nAnd sensory jutsu? Really? Is that really that impressive? If Ino of all people can use it, and both Naruto and Sasuke have permanent access to it in the form of their Six Paths forms, it isn\u2019t very noteworthy or useful if she can\u2019t react to what she senses fast enough.",

She trained with Neji most of her life, was in the best tracking team for a little while alongside Shino who\u2019s tactical as shit, I\u2019m sure she learned a lot. Pair that up with the fact she survived the war, actually helped Naruto against Pain, knows rotation, air palm and has the god damn byakugan; Sakura would NOT have an easy time dealing with Hinata, cause she is no pushover. At all. I mean she\u2019s the Hokage\u2019s wife and Sakura is the wife of one of the most powerful shinobi. Like I said before it would be a really good fight, the only edge I see for Sakura is her 100healings jutsu and it\u2019s not even a battle power.",

The seal is basically a last-ditch effort to survive, but has a *massive* cooldown due to how much chakra is needed to charge that battery.\n\nAnd sensory jutsu? Really? Is that really that impressive? If Ino of all people can use it, and both Naruto and Sasuke have permanent access to it in the form of their Six Paths forms, it isn\u2019t very noteworthy or useful if she can\u2019t react to what she senses fast enough.",

Sakura NEEDS to stay melee range to win, her moving away will give Itachi even more advantages. We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi.

Pair that up with the fact she survived the war, actually helped Naruto against Pain, knows rotation, air palm and has the god damn byakugan; Sakura would NOT have an easy time dealing with Hinata, cause she is no pushover. At all. I mean she\u2019s the Hokage\u2019s wife and Sakura is the wife of one of the most powerful shinobi. Like I said before it would be a really good fight, the only edge I see for Sakura is her 100healings jutsu and it\u2019s not even a battle power.",

Sakura is strong but Itachi is basically her perfect counter.",

For the last time IT DOESNT TAKE WEEKS to heal since tsunade did in 5 SECOND in naruto\n100 healings is a healing jutsu except it does it automatically as long as the user \nIf she is knocked out katsuyu can just absorb her\n\n2. She can obviously stay in long range and throw rocks and use katsuyu acide she will outlast him due to the fact she have more endurance and chakra\nShe can also put smalll katsuyu on herself to protect herself from amaterasu the burn of amaterasu before they even land\nShe can summon katsuyu who will divise and split acid from all direction distracting itachl\n\nItachi need to be in close range to land the amaterasu and even if he did land it on sakura that would leave a window for her to one shot his susano and kill him before amaterasu kill her\n\nSakura used a substitution jutsu in part 1 and in her fight against sarada",

At all. I mean she\u2019s the Hokage\u2019s wife and Sakura is the wife of one of the most powerful shinobi.

Assuming he lands a Tsukiyomi the fight is over instantly, but Sakura is smart enough to avoid looking into his eyes. However this will mean she is fighting blind.\n\n2. Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

For the last time IT DOESNT TAKE WEEKS to heal since tsunade did in 5 SECOND in naruto\n100 healings is a healing jutsu except it does it automatically as long as the user \nIf she is knocked out katsuyu can just absorb her\n\n2. She can obviously stay in long range and throw rocks and use katsuyu acide she will outlast him due to the fact she have more endurance and chakra\nShe can also put smalll katsuyu on herself to protect herself from amaterasu the burn of amaterasu before they even land\nShe can summon katsuyu who will divise and split acid from all direction distracting itachl\n\nItachi need to be in close range to land the amaterasu and even if he did land it on sakura that would leave a window for her to one shot his susano and kill him before amaterasu kill her\n\nSakura used a substitution jutsu in part 1 and in her fight against sarada",

Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

Sakura NEEDS to stay melee range to win, her moving away will give Itachi even more advantages. We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi.

Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

Sakura NEEDS to stay melee range to win, her moving away will give Itachi even more advantages. We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi.

Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

Sakura NEEDS to stay melee range to win, her moving away will give Itachi even more advantages. We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi.

Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes.

Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi. Sakura is strong but Itachi is basically her perfect counter.",

Yea, this is the only way she can win. She has a lot of chakra due to 100 healings and perfect control over it.\n\n3. The difference is Ameterasu is invisible until it lands, so unless she knows what she is up against (which she likely will not) it will be nearly impossible for her to dodge it, since she a) cannot see the threat and b) will not be able to track it bcs looking at where Itachi\u2019s line of sight is would mean getting caught in Tsukiyomi and losing the fight",

We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes.

We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi. Sakura is strong but Itachi is basically her perfect counter.",

She can obviously stay in long range and throw rocks and use katsuyu acide she will outlast him due to the fact she have more endurance and chakra\nShe can also put smalll katsuyu on herself to protect herself from amaterasu the burn of amaterasu before they even land\nShe can summon katsuyu who will divise and split acid from all direction distracting itachl\n\nItachi need to be in close range to land the amaterasu and even if he did land it on sakura that would leave a window for her to one shot his susano and kill him before amaterasu kill her\n\nSakura used a substitution jutsu in part 1 and in her fight against sarada",

Even if she is out for a minute she\u2019ll be dead bcs of the Totsuka blade.\n\n\n2. Mate seriously? Sakura NEEDS to stay melee range to win, her moving away will give Itachi even more advantages. We have never seen Sakura use a substitution. Ameterasu is invisible until it lands. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it bcs in order to do so you need to be carefully watching your opponents eyes. This would make her instantly lose to Tsukiyomi. Sakura is strong but Itachi is basically her perfect counter.",
