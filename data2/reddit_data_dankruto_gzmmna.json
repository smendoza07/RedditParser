Boruto's character isn't alike a ordinary shonen protagonist as well, he doesn't has a cliche goal to become the greatest of that or willing to make alot of friends, his way is complex and realistic.\n\nTldr; Boruto stopped being a spoiled brat since the Chunin Exam and the current arc showed how much he've changed,  he's completely different than his father was in the same age.",

Also, don\u2019t keep assuming I didn\u2019t watch just because I disagree with you. You are so desperate to prove that your own opinion is valid that you feel the need to make baseless claims about others so you can feel like your opinion has more weight. There are 2 points i want to address: 1. Look at the time travel arc, they literally make jokes about them acting the same, also, he acts exactly like naruto would in the arc with ohnoki, juugo,And in the sand village area. Also, i while he may not be as bad after episode 65, i still find him irritating. again, this is how i see him. It really doesn\u2019t matter to me if you don\u2019t agree, but don\u2019t try to invalidate other peoples opinions because they disagree with you.",

It had a modern feel that is portrayed relatively well, while still keeping that ninja vibe. One thing I cant say I'm a fan of is the completely useless arc we had for ages, the time travel arc.

Now that he finally has it we find out that it has only led to hardship for his family. Narutos dream and the things everyone wanted him to achieve is being portrayed as a negative in this story. \n\n>2. Never had an actual family so doesn't have those childhood experiences to bounce off as an adult \n\nThat doesn't make sense at all. He knows more than anyone how much loneliness sucks and how important a father figure is in your life. He was apparently a good dad before he became hokage, but after that he just got too caught up on work, which doesn't make sense because none of the other hokage had as much and naruto can also just use clones to get the work done quicker, but he doesn't because boruto needs a bad father for some reason.\n\n>Still has his save the world, do everything by my self but maybe my friends can tag along attitude. \n\nNo he doesn't. The whole point of Indra/ashura, sasuke/naruto was comparing the difference between natural talent and working together with other. Naruto had that mindset at the beginning of the war until Itachi reminded him to work with his comrades.\n\n>As for Boruto needs a bad dad for development no he doesn't, but that's the route they've gone for and as far as I'm concerned it's pretty compelling.\n\nThat's pretty subjective. There's plenty of people out there (tbh it looks like the majority) who hate how naruto is portrayed in boruto. If they don't need naruto to be a bad dad, then there's no reason to make him like that. It's something that could've easily been avoided but they chose to make him like that.",

I adore my dad but it was hard to deal with and process as a kid.\n\nNow Boruto on the other hand, his dad's literally Jesus, and to top it off probably the most famous person in the world. Sprinkle that with the rarely getting to see his rockstar Jesus dad and resentment is bound to grow.\n\nJust going to answer one of your other points here as well. Boruto absolutely does not have the best dad. I'd go as far as to say (in the first 50 or so episodes I've seen) that Naruto is a pretty shitty parent which I guess you could blame on him never really having a family to gleam experience off but it doesn't make it any easier for the kids who feel neglected.\n\nLike shit this is probably one of the most emotionally complex relationship's that the Naruto franchise has attempted. I'd go as far as to say it's the most compelling part of Boruto's character. \n\nI'm obviously routing for Naruto because Kishimoto has spent 700 episodes ramming this spazy little shite down my throat till I've gained Stockholm syndrome for him, but I'd have to have the emotional awareness of a spoon to not recognize how incredibly fucked his relationship with Boruto, and his family is. He needs to get over his \"I'm going to save everyone\" complex, hire some people to start dealing with paper work other than shikamaru and spend a bit of quality time with his god damn family.\n\nAlso I'm probably going to get crucified for this but I find Boruto a far more compelling character in those first 50 episodes than I ever did for Naruto in the original anime and I think it's mostly because of the interesting relationship he has with his family where as I mostly never felt that existed to the same extent in the original and Shippuden. \n\nUsually Naruto just punches someone, gets absolutely trounced then uses his Jesus powers to both hypnotize the person into believing he is undoubtedly correct in all matters of heaven and earth for all time ever so that they will defer to him in future as well as hitting them with an explosion so massive that both they and any plant or animal caught in the blast radius would be dead. This is how almost everything in Naruto gets resolved. It gets dull after awhile. \n\nAt least now he has actual stakes aside from stalk emo boy, hit on pink haired asshole and save the world. I actually care about the main characters for a change in this franchise and want to see them succeed in their family life and explore these flaws & relationships as well as watch massive fucking explosions, but shockingly the former is usually better for character development.",

Boruto's character isn't alike a ordinary shonen protagonist as well, he doesn't has a cliche goal to become the greatest of that or willing to make alot of friends, his way is complex and realistic.\n\nTldr; Boruto stopped being a spoiled brat since the Chunin Exam and the current arc showed how much he've changed,  he's completely different than his father was in the same age.",

There are 2 points i want to address: 1. Look at the time travel arc, they literally make jokes about them acting the same, also, he acts exactly like naruto would in the arc with ohnoki, juugo,And in the sand village area. Also, i while he may not be as bad after episode 65, i still find him irritating. again, this is how i see him.

I  personally think it's a shame to change it too moderny time.

Most children/teenagers like what's in the now, especially the electronic aspect, which boruto portrays well. Has the group playing video games One of the NINJA is using a computer, which I find mildly entertaining to see how his future will unfold. In synopsis: I actually sorta like boruto. It had a modern feel that is portrayed relatively well, while still keeping that ninja vibe. One thing I cant say I'm a fan of is the completely useless arc we had for ages, the time travel arc. Other than that.. its alright",

Now that he finally has it we find out that it has only led to hardship for his family. Narutos dream and the things everyone wanted him to achieve is being portrayed as a negative in this story. \n\n>2. Never had an actual family so doesn't have those childhood experiences to bounce off as an adult \n\nThat doesn't make sense at all. He knows more than anyone how much loneliness sucks and how important a father figure is in your life. He was apparently a good dad before he became hokage, but after that he just got too caught up on work, which doesn't make sense because none of the other hokage had as much and naruto can also just use clones to get the work done quicker, but he doesn't because boruto needs a bad father for some reason.\n\n>Still has his save the world, do everything by my self but maybe my friends can tag along attitude. \n\nNo he doesn't. The whole point of Indra/ashura, sasuke/naruto was comparing the difference between natural talent and working together with other. Naruto had that mindset at the beginning of the war until Itachi reminded him to work with his comrades.\n\n>As for Boruto needs a bad dad for development no he doesn't, but that's the route they've gone for and as far as I'm concerned it's pretty compelling.\n\nThat's pretty subjective. There's plenty of people out there (tbh it looks like the majority) who hate how naruto is portrayed in boruto. If they don't need naruto to be a bad dad, then there's no reason to make him like that. It's something that could've easily been avoided but they chose to make him like that.",

Both characters are far better off and more interesting for it. Magical explosions =/= character development.\n\nMate, as someone that had a dad who all my friends would comment on how cool he was, I can sympathize with N\nBoruto because it gets annoying as shit, you feel like your worth is less of that than what your dad has to your peers and that's an immensely shitty feeling which makes you say and think things you don't mean. I adore my dad but it was hard to deal with and process as a kid.\n\nNow Boruto on the other hand, his dad's literally Jesus, and to top it off probably the most famous person in the world. Sprinkle that with the rarely getting to see his rockstar Jesus dad and resentment is bound to grow.\n\nJust going to answer one of your other points here as well. Boruto absolutely does not have the best dad. I'd go as far as to say (in the first 50 or so episodes I've seen) that Naruto is a pretty shitty parent which I guess you could blame on him never really having a family to gleam experience off but it doesn't make it any easier for the kids who feel neglected.\n\nLike shit this is probably one of the most emotionally complex relationship's that the Naruto franchise has attempted. I'd go as far as to say it's the most compelling part of Boruto's character. \n\nI'm obviously routing for Naruto because Kishimoto has spent 700 episodes ramming this spazy little shite down my throat till I've gained Stockholm syndrome for him, but I'd have to have the emotional awareness of a spoon to not recognize how incredibly fucked his relationship with Boruto, and his family is. He needs to get over his \"I'm going to save everyone\" complex, hire some people to start dealing with paper work other than shikamaru and spend a bit of quality time with his god damn family.\n\nAlso I'm probably going to get crucified for this but I find Boruto a far more compelling character in those first 50 episodes than I ever did for Naruto in the original anime and I think it's mostly because of the interesting relationship he has with his family where as I mostly never felt that existed to the same extent in the original and Shippuden. \n\nUsually Naruto just punches someone, gets absolutely trounced then uses his Jesus powers to both hypnotize the person into believing he is undoubtedly correct in all matters of heaven and earth for all time ever so that they will defer to him in future as well as hitting them with an explosion so massive that both they and any plant or animal caught in the blast radius would be dead. This is how almost everything in Naruto gets resolved. It gets dull after awhile. \n\nAt least now he has actual stakes aside from stalk emo boy, hit on pink haired asshole and save the world. I actually care about the main characters for a change in this franchise and want to see them succeed in their family life and explore these flaws & relationships as well as watch massive fucking explosions, but shockingly the former is usually better for character development.",

Boruto  & Naruto at his youth are not alike, you would know this if you had truly caught up In the anime, I won't even get to the part because I can make a long reasons of their difference.\n\nBoruto isn't a ordinary protagonist in comparison to other's, his story and lifestyle is very different than commons, he doesn't start as a underdog or ostriszed but as a genius and prodigy whose adored by other's along having a family. Boruto's character isn't alike a ordinary shonen protagonist as well, he doesn't has a cliche goal to become the greatest of that or willing to make alot of friends, his way is complex and realistic.\n\nTldr; Boruto stopped being a spoiled brat since the Chunin Exam and the current arc showed how much he've changed,  he's completely different than his father was in the same age.",

There are 2 points i want to address: 1. Look at the time travel arc, they literally make jokes about them acting the same, also, he acts exactly like naruto would in the arc with ohnoki, juugo,And in the sand village area. Also, i while he may not be as bad after episode 65, i still find him irritating. again, this is how i see him.

What i saw and was annoyed by was when you claimed that because I don\u2019t see it the way you do, i must be lying about being caught up. And i agree that boruto was def smarter than kid naruto (in some sense) but i was talking more about ideology, like naruto wouldn\u2019t have left juugo alone either.",

It had a modern feel that is portrayed relatively well, while still keeping that ninja vibe. One thing I cant say I'm a fan of is the completely useless arc we had for ages, the time travel arc.

Never had an actual family so doesn't have those childhood experiences to bounce off as an adult \n\nThat doesn't make sense at all. He knows more than anyone how much loneliness sucks and how important a father figure is in your life. He was apparently a good dad before he became hokage, but after that he just got too caught up on work, which doesn't make sense because none of the other hokage had as much and naruto can also just use clones to get the work done quicker, but he doesn't because boruto needs a bad father for some reason.\n\n>Still has his save the world, do everything by my self but maybe my friends can tag along attitude. \n\nNo he doesn't. The whole point of Indra/ashura, sasuke/naruto was comparing the difference between natural talent and working together with other. Naruto had that mindset at the beginning of the war until Itachi reminded him to work with his comrades.\n\n>As for Boruto needs a bad dad for development no he doesn't, but that's the route they've gone for and as far as I'm concerned it's pretty compelling.\n\nThat's pretty subjective. There's plenty of people out there (tbh it looks like the majority) who hate how naruto is portrayed in boruto. If they don't need naruto to be a bad dad, then there's no reason to make him like that. It's something that could've easily been avoided but they chose to make him like that.",

Both characters are far better off and more interesting for it. Magical explosions =/= character development.\n\nMate, as someone that had a dad who all my friends would comment on how cool he was, I can sympathize with N\nBoruto because it gets annoying as shit, you feel like your worth is less of that than what your dad has to your peers and that's an immensely shitty feeling which makes you say and think things you don't mean. I adore my dad but it was hard to deal with and process as a kid.\n\nNow Boruto on the other hand, his dad's literally Jesus, and to top it off probably the most famous person in the world. Sprinkle that with the rarely getting to see his rockstar Jesus dad and resentment is bound to grow.\n\nJust going to answer one of your other points here as well. Boruto absolutely does not have the best dad. I'd go as far as to say (in the first 50 or so episodes I've seen) that Naruto is a pretty shitty parent which I guess you could blame on him never really having a family to gleam experience off but it doesn't make it any easier for the kids who feel neglected.\n\nLike shit this is probably one of the most emotionally complex relationship's that the Naruto franchise has attempted. I'd go as far as to say it's the most compelling part of Boruto's character. \n\nI'm obviously routing for Naruto because Kishimoto has spent 700 episodes ramming this spazy little shite down my throat till I've gained Stockholm syndrome for him, but I'd have to have the emotional awareness of a spoon to not recognize how incredibly fucked his relationship with Boruto, and his family is. He needs to get over his \"I'm going to save everyone\" complex, hire some people to start dealing with paper work other than shikamaru and spend a bit of quality time with his god damn family.\n\nAlso I'm probably going to get crucified for this but I find Boruto a far more compelling character in those first 50 episodes than I ever did for Naruto in the original anime and I think it's mostly because of the interesting relationship he has with his family where as I mostly never felt that existed to the same extent in the original and Shippuden. \n\nUsually Naruto just punches someone, gets absolutely trounced then uses his Jesus powers to both hypnotize the person into believing he is undoubtedly correct in all matters of heaven and earth for all time ever so that they will defer to him in future as well as hitting them with an explosion so massive that both they and any plant or animal caught in the blast radius would be dead. This is how almost everything in Naruto gets resolved. It gets dull after awhile. \n\nAt least now he has actual stakes aside from stalk emo boy, hit on pink haired asshole and save the world. I actually care about the main characters for a change in this franchise and want to see them succeed in their family life and explore these flaws & relationships as well as watch massive fucking explosions, but shockingly the former is usually better for character development.",

Boruto's character isn't alike a ordinary shonen protagonist as well, he doesn't has a cliche goal to become the greatest of that or willing to make alot of friends, his way is complex and realistic.\n\nTldr; Boruto stopped being a spoiled brat since the Chunin Exam and the current arc showed how much he've changed,  he's completely different than his father was in the same age.",

You are so desperate to prove that your own opinion is valid that you feel the need to make baseless claims about others so you can feel like your opinion has more weight. There are 2 points i want to address: 1. Look at the time travel arc, they literally make jokes about them acting the same, also, he acts exactly like naruto would in the arc with ohnoki, juugo,And in the sand village area. Also, i while he may not be as bad after episode 65, i still find him irritating. again, this is how i see him. It really doesn\u2019t matter to me if you don\u2019t agree, but don\u2019t try to invalidate other peoples opinions because they disagree with you.",

Narutos dream and the things everyone wanted him to achieve is being portrayed as a negative in this story. \n\n>2. Never had an actual family so doesn't have those childhood experiences to bounce off as an adult \n\nThat doesn't make sense at all. He knows more than anyone how much loneliness sucks and how important a father figure is in your life. He was apparently a good dad before he became hokage, but after that he just got too caught up on work, which doesn't make sense because none of the other hokage had as much and naruto can also just use clones to get the work done quicker, but he doesn't because boruto needs a bad father for some reason.\n\n>Still has his save the world, do everything by my self but maybe my friends can tag along attitude. \n\nNo he doesn't. The whole point of Indra/ashura, sasuke/naruto was comparing the difference between natural talent and working together with other. Naruto had that mindset at the beginning of the war until Itachi reminded him to work with his comrades.\n\n>As for Boruto needs a bad dad for development no he doesn't, but that's the route they've gone for and as far as I'm concerned it's pretty compelling.\n\nThat's pretty subjective. There's plenty of people out there (tbh it looks like the majority) who hate how naruto is portrayed in boruto. If they don't need naruto to be a bad dad, then there's no reason to make him like that. It's something that could've easily been avoided but they chose to make him like that.",

Magical explosions =/= character development.\n\nMate, as someone that had a dad who all my friends would comment on how cool he was, I can sympathize with N\nBoruto because it gets annoying as shit, you feel like your worth is less of that than what your dad has to your peers and that's an immensely shitty feeling which makes you say and think things you don't mean. I adore my dad but it was hard to deal with and process as a kid.\n\nNow Boruto on the other hand, his dad's literally Jesus, and to top it off probably the most famous person in the world. Sprinkle that with the rarely getting to see his rockstar Jesus dad and resentment is bound to grow.\n\nJust going to answer one of your other points here as well. Boruto absolutely does not have the best dad. I'd go as far as to say (in the first 50 or so episodes I've seen) that Naruto is a pretty shitty parent which I guess you could blame on him never really having a family to gleam experience off but it doesn't make it any easier for the kids who feel neglected.\n\nLike shit this is probably one of the most emotionally complex relationship's that the Naruto franchise has attempted. I'd go as far as to say it's the most compelling part of Boruto's character. \n\nI'm obviously routing for Naruto because Kishimoto has spent 700 episodes ramming this spazy little shite down my throat till I've gained Stockholm syndrome for him, but I'd have to have the emotional awareness of a spoon to not recognize how incredibly fucked his relationship with Boruto, and his family is. He needs to get over his \"I'm going to save everyone\" complex, hire some people to start dealing with paper work other than shikamaru and spend a bit of quality time with his god damn family.\n\nAlso I'm probably going to get crucified for this but I find Boruto a far more compelling character in those first 50 episodes than I ever did for Naruto in the original anime and I think it's mostly because of the interesting relationship he has with his family where as I mostly never felt that existed to the same extent in the original and Shippuden. \n\nUsually Naruto just punches someone, gets absolutely trounced then uses his Jesus powers to both hypnotize the person into believing he is undoubtedly correct in all matters of heaven and earth for all time ever so that they will defer to him in future as well as hitting them with an explosion so massive that both they and any plant or animal caught in the blast radius would be dead. This is how almost everything in Naruto gets resolved. It gets dull after awhile. \n\nAt least now he has actual stakes aside from stalk emo boy, hit on pink haired asshole and save the world. I actually care about the main characters for a change in this franchise and want to see them succeed in their family life and explore these flaws & relationships as well as watch massive fucking explosions, but shockingly the former is usually better for character development.",

Boruto's character isn't alike a ordinary shonen protagonist as well, he doesn't has a cliche goal to become the greatest of that or willing to make alot of friends, his way is complex and realistic.\n\nTldr; Boruto stopped being a spoiled brat since the Chunin Exam and the current arc showed how much he've changed,  he's completely different than his father was in the same age.",

Look at the time travel arc, they literally make jokes about them acting the same, also, he acts exactly like naruto would in the arc with ohnoki, juugo,And in the sand village area. Also, i while he may not be as bad after episode 65, i still find him irritating. again, this is how i see him. It really doesn\u2019t matter to me if you don\u2019t agree, but don\u2019t try to invalidate other peoples opinions because they disagree with you.",

Now that he finally has it we find out that it has only led to hardship for his family. Narutos dream and the things everyone wanted him to achieve is being portrayed as a negative in this story. \n\n>2. Never had an actual family so doesn't have those childhood experiences to bounce off as an adult \n\nThat doesn't make sense at all. He knows more than anyone how much loneliness sucks and how important a father figure is in your life. He was apparently a good dad before he became hokage, but after that he just got too caught up on work, which doesn't make sense because none of the other hokage had as much and naruto can also just use clones to get the work done quicker, but he doesn't because boruto needs a bad father for some reason.\n\n>Still has his save the world, do everything by my self but maybe my friends can tag along attitude. \n\nNo he doesn't. The whole point of Indra/ashura, sasuke/naruto was comparing the difference between natural talent and working together with other. Naruto had that mindset at the beginning of the war until Itachi reminded him to work with his comrades.\n\n>As for Boruto needs a bad dad for development no he doesn't, but that's the route they've gone for and as far as I'm concerned it's pretty compelling.\n\nThat's pretty subjective. There's plenty of people out there (tbh it looks like the majority) who hate how naruto is portrayed in boruto. If they don't need naruto to be a bad dad, then there's no reason to make him like that. It's something that could've easily been avoided but they chose to make him like that.",

Magical explosions =/= character development.\n\nMate, as someone that had a dad who all my friends would comment on how cool he was, I can sympathize with N\nBoruto because it gets annoying as shit, you feel like your worth is less of that than what your dad has to your peers and that's an immensely shitty feeling which makes you say and think things you don't mean. I adore my dad but it was hard to deal with and process as a kid.\n\nNow Boruto on the other hand, his dad's literally Jesus, and to top it off probably the most famous person in the world. Sprinkle that with the rarely getting to see his rockstar Jesus dad and resentment is bound to grow.\n\nJust going to answer one of your other points here as well. Boruto absolutely does not have the best dad. I'd go as far as to say (in the first 50 or so episodes I've seen) that Naruto is a pretty shitty parent which I guess you could blame on him never really having a family to gleam experience off but it doesn't make it any easier for the kids who feel neglected.\n\nLike shit this is probably one of the most emotionally complex relationship's that the Naruto franchise has attempted. I'd go as far as to say it's the most compelling part of Boruto's character. \n\nI'm obviously routing for Naruto because Kishimoto has spent 700 episodes ramming this spazy little shite down my throat till I've gained Stockholm syndrome for him, but I'd have to have the emotional awareness of a spoon to not recognize how incredibly fucked his relationship with Boruto, and his family is. He needs to get over his \"I'm going to save everyone\" complex, hire some people to start dealing with paper work other than shikamaru and spend a bit of quality time with his god damn family.\n\nAlso I'm probably going to get crucified for this but I find Boruto a far more compelling character in those first 50 episodes than I ever did for Naruto in the original anime and I think it's mostly because of the interesting relationship he has with his family where as I mostly never felt that existed to the same extent in the original and Shippuden. \n\nUsually Naruto just punches someone, gets absolutely trounced then uses his Jesus powers to both hypnotize the person into believing he is undoubtedly correct in all matters of heaven and earth for all time ever so that they will defer to him in future as well as hitting them with an explosion so massive that both they and any plant or animal caught in the blast radius would be dead. This is how almost everything in Naruto gets resolved. It gets dull after awhile. \n\nAt least now he has actual stakes aside from stalk emo boy, hit on pink haired asshole and save the world. I actually care about the main characters for a change in this franchise and want to see them succeed in their family life and explore these flaws & relationships as well as watch massive fucking explosions, but shockingly the former is usually better for character development.",

Boruto  & Naruto at his youth are not alike, you would know this if you had truly caught up In the anime, I won't even get to the part because I can make a long reasons of their difference.\n\nBoruto isn't a ordinary protagonist in comparison to other's, his story and lifestyle is very different than commons, he doesn't start as a underdog or ostriszed but as a genius and prodigy whose adored by other's along having a family. Boruto's character isn't alike a ordinary shonen protagonist as well, he doesn't has a cliche goal to become the greatest of that or willing to make alot of friends, his way is complex and realistic.\n\nTldr; Boruto stopped being a spoiled brat since the Chunin Exam and the current arc showed how much he've changed,  he's completely different than his father was in the same age.",
