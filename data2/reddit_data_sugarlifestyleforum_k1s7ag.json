She almost always agrees to continue our time together for a meal, and often requests it, when sometimes I'm and unavailable. It is just not how the purists define an SR. Being old, fat, bald, and paralyzed makes me an unattractive human by most standards of any relationship that involves sexual interaction. For me it is similar to looking at steps where the view is best at the top. I know what is at the top. I have been at the top before. I cannot get there now. Does that mean that I do not get out? Does that mean that I do not look at the obstructed view because it is less than that which is available at the top? No. I suck it up. I understand and accept my limitations. I enjoy the obstructed, lesser view, because I accept that it is the best that I can get.",

I'm far too arrogant to think that they can help me, considering that as a physician, I am trained more extensively and know more in general than they. As the admission to medical school is so competitive, it tends to weed out the mentally weak, the unintelligent, and the poorly educated. I consider those that seek advise from motivational speakers as weak, uneducated, and too easily manipulated. I'm unfamiliar with Kona University and it's admission standards & competitiveness.\n I went to psychotherapy after breaking my neck for depression, and with my wife to try to salvage our sex life/marriage. I found the therapists unintelligent, uneducated, poorly trained, and manipulative. Their goal was less to treat & heal, but to extend the therapy of a paying client who showed up to his/their appointments. I grew up with a mother who was a physician, who's specialty was psychiatry. I was constantly being analysed and evaluated. I learned her techniques, and how to be manipulative myself.\nMr. Stephenson was likely better off than I have been for the last 16 years, but less well off than I was for my first 35 years. I have little sensation below my neck. I have no bowel, bladder or ejaculatory function. I cannot wipe my own butt. I cannot dress myself. Once in bed I'm stuck there until a woman gets me up.",

I'm far too arrogant to think that they can help me, considering that as a physician, I am trained more extensively and know more in general than they. As the admission to medical school is so competitive, it tends to weed out the mentally weak, the unintelligent, and the poorly educated. I consider those that seek advise from motivational speakers as weak, uneducated, and too easily manipulated. I'm unfamiliar with Kona University and it's admission standards & competitiveness.\n I went to psychotherapy after breaking my neck for depression, and with my wife to try to salvage our sex life/marriage. I found the therapists unintelligent, uneducated, poorly trained, and manipulative. Their goal was less to treat & heal, but to extend the therapy of a paying client who showed up to his/their appointments. I grew up with a mother who was a physician, who's specialty was psychiatry. I was constantly being analysed and evaluated. I learned her techniques, and how to be manipulative myself.\nMr. Stephenson was likely better off than I have been for the last 16 years, but less well off than I was for my first 35 years. I have little sensation below my neck. I have no bowel, bladder or ejaculatory function. I cannot wipe my own butt. I cannot dress myself. Once in bed I'm stuck there until a woman gets me up.",

I do not presume to be smarter than everyone else. I do realize that I do not know everything, nor have I claimed that I do. Even in my field, I am mediocre at best. But this is to me all irrelevant to my discussion. \nHow is my pessimism holding me back? From what is it holding me back?\nHow would I benefit from not calling others weak and unintelligent? And I'm calling them that here in this post, not to their faces. I usually, but not always, refrain from exposing my disdain, and feelings of superiority towards others, unless their knowledge of my opinion of them is irrelevant to my life.  All of these posts in this thread arise from my experience with my SB. We are honest and open with each other. I respect her intellect, academic accomplishments, job, athletic accomplishments, and who she is. As my comments about her not expressing appreciation of me initiated this thread, please explain how me changing in the ways that you have suggested would alter the outcome of my SB expressing appreciation of me?",

I'm far too arrogant to think that they can help me, considering that as a physician, I am trained more extensively and know more in general than they. As the admission to medical school is so competitive, it tends to weed out the mentally weak, the unintelligent, and the poorly educated. I consider those that seek advise from motivational speakers as weak, uneducated, and too easily manipulated. I'm unfamiliar with Kona University and it's admission standards & competitiveness.\n I went to psychotherapy after breaking my neck for depression, and with my wife to try to salvage our sex life/marriage. I found the therapists unintelligent, uneducated, poorly trained, and manipulative. Their goal was less to treat & heal, but to extend the therapy of a paying client who showed up to his/their appointments. I grew up with a mother who was a physician, who's specialty was psychiatry. I was constantly being analysed and evaluated. I learned her techniques, and how to be manipulative myself.\nMr. Stephenson was likely better off than I have been for the last 16 years, but less well off than I was for my first 35 years.

What am I down from. How is my attitude not realistic. I'm completely open and honest to my therapists. As I feel superior to them, I fail to see how hiding a truth from them can benefit myself. If anything, I reveal everything to show their ineptness. I disagree that there is something to be learned from everyone. I have too high an opinion of myself. I do not understand what \"emotional intelligence\" is. How is having that going to evoke emotion from my SB? Considering that I'm a quadriplegic, I think that my life is pretty good. Why do you think that my life is poor, that I should change what I'm doing to make it better?",

I'm unfamiliar with Kona University and it's admission standards & competitiveness.\n I went to psychotherapy after breaking my neck for depression, and with my wife to try to salvage our sex life/marriage. I found the therapists unintelligent, uneducated, poorly trained, and manipulative. Their goal was less to treat & heal, but to extend the therapy of a paying client who showed up to his/their appointments. I grew up with a mother who was a physician, who's specialty was psychiatry. I was constantly being analysed and evaluated. I learned her techniques, and how to be manipulative myself.\nMr. Stephenson was likely better off than I have been for the last 16 years, but less well off than I was for my first 35 years. I have little sensation below my neck. I have no bowel, bladder or ejaculatory function. I cannot wipe my own butt. I cannot dress myself. Once in bed I'm stuck there until a woman gets me up.",

How is my attitude not realistic. I'm completely open and honest to my therapists. As I feel superior to them, I fail to see how hiding a truth from them can benefit myself. If anything, I reveal everything to show their ineptness. I disagree that there is something to be learned from everyone. I have too high an opinion of myself. I do not understand what \"emotional intelligence\" is. How is having that going to evoke emotion from my SB? Considering that I'm a quadriplegic, I think that my life is pretty good. Why do you think that my life is poor, that I should change what I'm doing to make it better?",

But this is to me all irrelevant to my discussion. \nHow is my pessimism holding me back? From what is it holding me back?\nHow would I benefit from not calling others weak and unintelligent? And I'm calling them that here in this post, not to their faces. I usually, but not always, refrain from exposing my disdain, and feelings of superiority towards others, unless their knowledge of my opinion of them is irrelevant to my life.  All of these posts in this thread arise from my experience with my SB. We are honest and open with each other. I respect her intellect, academic accomplishments, job, athletic accomplishments, and who she is. As my comments about her not expressing appreciation of me initiated this thread, please explain how me changing in the ways that you have suggested would alter the outcome of my SB expressing appreciation of me?",
