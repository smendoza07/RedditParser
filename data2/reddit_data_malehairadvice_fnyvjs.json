I\u2019ve got similar hair - if a bit curlier - and I\u2019ve learned that hair with a bit of a wave in it dries out a lot easier than straight hair. I\u2019d recommend not shampooing more than once every three days max. Secondly, have you tried a leave-in conditioner? I use an argan oil \u2018curl activator cr\u00e8me\u2019 which I\u2019ve found gives thickness and stops dryness without giving too much hold. The problem with waxes are they are for giving stiffness, which is not what you\u2019re after, so the amount that you would need for the look above will only weigh your hair down and make it look greasy. Good luck!",

There are certain products that you could use but I would recommend you try and dip shampooing for a bit, and use only conditioner. Use a big amount of conditioner, and condition every 2-3 days and do not shampoo. Give this a try for the next 2 weeks to see how the results go, without shampooing. You should eventually shampoo, but do not do it as often as you currently are. This is called co-washing or conditioner only washing. I would check out r/curlyhair for advice on curly hair - they go way more into depth on this than I am even able to understand.\n\n\nAlso, try leaving conditioner in for an hour and then wash it out. This would make it a little less dry.",

Next, I add about a dab or two of Brylcreem (it's like a hair cream you can get it on Amazon for like under 10 dollars with shipping) and distribute it all over my hair. Finally, I just blow-dry it straight down.  \n  \nBeen doing this only recently but I've found it leaves my hair with a similar consistency and texture like the dude on the right hand side.
