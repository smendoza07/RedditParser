She (rightly) expected the two of them would stop as soon as they saw her standing in between. What she didn't expect was that Naruto and Sasuke weren't skilled enough to stop their attack. I guess the worst she expected to happen was that she became the sacrifice but at least Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't be hurt more than necessary. \n\nDepending on the way you looked at the situation she was either incredibly gallant or stupid. Though it was probably a mix of both given that she didn't have much of a choice (given her current skill level) and that she made that split second decision that would've saved Naruto and Sasuke anyway (in expense of her life) had Kakashi not interfered.",

But it is ridiculous so many people to hate Sakura for the same silly shit a bunch of other characters in the series are guilty of. \n\nHinata did what I said above, and was even more obsessed with Naruto than Sakura was with Sasuke.

But it is ridiculous so many people to hate Sakura for the same silly shit a bunch of other characters in the series are guilty of. \n\nHinata did what I said above, and was even more obsessed with Naruto than Sakura was with Sasuke. Temari got housewifed even harder than Sakura did. Ino was just as \u2018weak\u2019 for all of the OG and Tenten had even less relevance to the plot. \n\nDislike Sakura on personal grounds if you want, but don\u2019t act like she\u2019s the pinnacle of terrible characterization when nearly all of her female counterparts in the show are either just as bad or even worse.",

But it is ridiculous so many people to hate Sakura for the same silly shit a bunch of other characters in the series are guilty of. \n\nHinata did what I said above, and was even more obsessed with Naruto than Sakura was with Sasuke. Temari got housewifed even harder than Sakura did. Ino was just as \u2018weak\u2019 for all of the OG and Tenten had even less relevance to the plot. \n\nDislike Sakura on personal grounds if you want, but don\u2019t act like she\u2019s the pinnacle of terrible characterization when nearly all of her female counterparts in the show are either just as bad or even worse.",

But it is ridiculous so many people to hate Sakura for the same silly shit a bunch of other characters in the series are guilty of. \n\nHinata did what I said above, and was even more obsessed with Naruto than Sakura was with Sasuke. Temari got housewifed even harder than Sakura did. Ino was just as \u2018weak\u2019 for all of the OG and Tenten had even less relevance to the plot. \n\nDislike Sakura on personal grounds if you want, but don\u2019t act like she\u2019s the pinnacle of terrible characterization when nearly all of her female counterparts in the show are either just as bad or even worse.",

Though it was probably a mix of both given that she didn't have much of a choice (given her current skill level) and that she made that split second decision that would've saved Naruto and Sasuke anyway (in expense of her life) had Kakashi not interfered.",

But it is ridiculous so many people to hate Sakura for the same silly shit a bunch of other characters in the series are guilty of. \n\nHinata did what I said above, and was even more obsessed with Naruto than Sakura was with Sasuke. Temari got housewifed even harder than Sakura did. Ino was just as \u2018weak\u2019 for all of the OG and Tenten had even less relevance to the plot. \n\nDislike Sakura on personal grounds if you want, but don\u2019t act like she\u2019s the pinnacle of terrible characterization when nearly all of her female counterparts in the show are either just as bad or even worse.",

Ino was just as \u2018weak\u2019 for all of the OG and Tenten had even less relevance to the plot. \n\nDislike Sakura on personal grounds if you want, but don\u2019t act like she\u2019s the pinnacle of terrible characterization when nearly all of her female counterparts in the show are either just as bad or even worse.",
