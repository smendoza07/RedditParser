It\u2019s like,  because I don\u2019t particularly want to meddle in their life for the first 4 months or so they are suddenly wanting my opinion on how to handle situations which then leads to more involvement.  I really wish to keep boundaries but I also hate seeing my girls struggle with things I can easily fix.  I\u2019m a guy,  I\u2019m wired to fix problems.  \n\nExample... I have nice size small business and I was looking at my cell phone bill.   I realized I had 7 current and past SB\u2019s on my Verizon bill.

Their justification is 'I'm too busy for a relationship so I'm on here.' More often than not you'll see it in profiles of men under 40. Sometimes they're attractive, sometimes they're not.  \n\n\nThey lead with 'I don't have a problem getting sex without paying for it' to either set an expectation anchor for the SB that she's not getting an allowance or to make them feel better about being on the site. Regardless, the conversation generally leads to the fact that they want to put in the minimum effort (paying for coffee/dinner) in order to get an on-demand booty-call girlfriend without any of the commitment or emotional expectation of an ongoing relationship.  \n\n\nThese guys may genuinely not have problems meeting women, but they want to get to sex as quickly as possible or lower the risk of multiple encounters with random women. My observation is that the really attractive and successful men have some other problem with their personality or lifestyle that prevents them from finding women who can fulfill this need in their vanilla dating life.",

Finding sexual pleasure is not hard for me and I can certainly please myself if needed. But to make some statements like above, especially on SA and/or knowing I\u2019m a SB is insulting to me and the men I have shared time with. Such statements are likely to leave that person lonely in their later years.\n\n\u201cI want to be good friends, I don\u2019t want to be like the other men in your life, what we have is special.\u201d or \u201cI will take care of your physical and emotional needs.\u201d Translation: Can I get the friends and family discount or how about Free.\n\nOne more thing... It\u2019s not really a double meaning, but a reaction to another statement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually pay, but I\u2019ll help out with a bill or emergency.\u201d. First off, I don\u2019t think any woman should rely on SB or sex work in general to pay for a bill or housing. That\u2019s a dangerous slope. One it puts the woman on an unlovely playing field. It may make her do things she\u2019s not comfortable with just to pay the rent or utilities. Second, why does a girl have to be in need? Can\u2019t she just be lovely to spend time and bring added value to your life? I really wish sex work was legal throughout America. There are women who do this out of sheer pleasure and to enhance their life. Not be dependent on it.\n\nWhew, that was a mouthful.\n\nAnd just to add, these lines are not every man... but 90% of the time if said, they mean what the SBs are writing. Furthermore, not every man would say such things in the first place. Thank you to the daddies who are honest and open!",

He has absolutely zero concept of discretion.  When he shows up he tries to kiss me because \"I've missed you so much, I just can't wait for a kiss\"... right in front of my 80+ year old neighbour's living room window.  He's generally a great SD, reliable, generous, respectful, and he treats me really well. He just has absolutely no class or concept of the idea that maybe PDA isn't appropriate in the extremely conservative neighbourhood I live in, especially not in front of the nosiest neighbour on my street (she's retired and as far as I can tell has no friends or hobbies besides spying on the entire street, lol).",

She doesn't dress like a hooker, she's giving her doctoral thesis, applying for jobs, and working. She literally needs nice clothes for her life to function correctly.\n\nI hate italian food. I tell my SB all the time I don't like \"that type\" of restaurant, yet we had a $1200 tab the last time we went out to eat.\n\nAnd yeah, less public SRs are pretty common.\n\n\nYour post grossly generalizes SDs.

To suggest wanting a private SR is some type of sin, when nearly all effective SR's have some level of discretion and privacy, is a misrepresentation of SR dating to begin with.\n\nTo suggest not wanting something to feel transactional means anything other than both parties not wanting it to feel like prostitution is dishonest. This is the hallmark of SA, and literally any conversation I have ever had with POTs. Nobody wants it to feel transactional. \n\nSuggesting to your SB you want to buy her nice clothes doesn't mean you think she dresses like a hooker, it could just mean I want to buy you something nice. \n\nAnd again, I very specifically stated that OP was generalizing SD's.

It\u2019s like,  because I don\u2019t particularly want to meddle in their life for the first 4 months or so they are suddenly wanting my opinion on how to handle situations which then leads to more involvement.  I really wish to keep boundaries but I also hate seeing my girls struggle with things I can easily fix.  I\u2019m a guy,  I\u2019m wired to fix problems.  \n\nExample... I have nice size small business and I was looking at my cell phone bill.   I realized I had 7 current and past SB\u2019s on my Verizon bill.   I have a few car leases for current SB\u2019s (cheaper VW\u2019s) .",

Their justification is 'I'm too busy for a relationship so I'm on here.' More often than not you'll see it in profiles of men under 40. Sometimes they're attractive, sometimes they're not.  \n\n\nThey lead with 'I don't have a problem getting sex without paying for it' to either set an expectation anchor for the SB that she's not getting an allowance or to make them feel better about being on the site. Regardless, the conversation generally leads to the fact that they want to put in the minimum effort (paying for coffee/dinner) in order to get an on-demand booty-call girlfriend without any of the commitment or emotional expectation of an ongoing relationship.  \n\n\nThese guys may genuinely not have problems meeting women, but they want to get to sex as quickly as possible or lower the risk of multiple encounters with random women. My observation is that the really attractive and successful men have some other problem with their personality or lifestyle that prevents them from finding women who can fulfill this need in their vanilla dating life.",

Rich men mostly marry rich women, specially because of the many assets that have to be shared.\n\nSo many women mistake having sex with a rich attractive guy for \"he will share all of his life with me\".\n\nThere just aren't enough rich men (not even countering attractive) for all the women that want to date one.",

Coffee dates are low effort and if you are in this lifestyle as a woman you put a lot into your look on a date... just for it to be coffee?

The way I made it worth my time was to book them on the same day I already had a dinner date with another POT so I didn't waste the time getting ready 'just for coffee'.",

Their justification is 'I'm too busy for a relationship so I'm on here.' More often than not you'll see it in profiles of men under 40. Sometimes they're attractive, sometimes they're not.  \n\n\nThey lead with 'I don't have a problem getting sex without paying for it' to either set an expectation anchor for the SB that she's not getting an allowance or to make them feel better about being on the site. Regardless, the conversation generally leads to the fact that they want to put in the minimum effort (paying for coffee/dinner) in order to get an on-demand booty-call girlfriend without any of the commitment or emotional expectation of an ongoing relationship.  \n\n\nThese guys may genuinely not have problems meeting women, but they want to get to sex as quickly as possible or lower the risk of multiple encounters with random women. My observation is that the really attractive and successful men have some other problem with their personality or lifestyle that prevents them from finding women who can fulfill this need in their vanilla dating life.",

Rich men mostly marry rich women, specially because of the many assets that have to be shared.\n\nSo many women mistake having sex with a rich attractive guy for \"he will share all of his life with me\".\n\nThere just aren't enough rich men (not even countering attractive) for all the women that want to date one.",

When he shows up he tries to kiss me because \"I've missed you so much, I just can't wait for a kiss\"... right in front of my 80+ year old neighbour's living room window.  He's generally a great SD, reliable, generous, respectful, and he treats me really well. He just has absolutely no class or concept of the idea that maybe PDA isn't appropriate in the extremely conservative neighbourhood I live in, especially not in front of the nosiest neighbour on my street (she's retired and as far as I can tell has no friends or hobbies besides spying on the entire street, lol).",

The way I made it worth my time was to book them on the same day I already had a dinner date with another POT so I didn't waste the time getting ready 'just for coffee'.",

Inform him that 1) you just feel awkward with the envelope exchange during the date and 2) that it helps you to have something consistent, even if it's slightly less.\n\nThe other option is to try to set the same time each week with him and schedule in advance so it's on both of your schedules to look forward to, and you know you'll be taken care of.",

More often than not you'll see it in profiles of men under 40. Sometimes they're attractive, sometimes they're not.  \n\n\nThey lead with 'I don't have a problem getting sex without paying for it' to either set an expectation anchor for the SB that she's not getting an allowance or to make them feel better about being on the site. Regardless, the conversation generally leads to the fact that they want to put in the minimum effort (paying for coffee/dinner) in order to get an on-demand booty-call girlfriend without any of the commitment or emotional expectation of an ongoing relationship.  \n\n\nThese guys may genuinely not have problems meeting women, but they want to get to sex as quickly as possible or lower the risk of multiple encounters with random women. My observation is that the really attractive and successful men have some other problem with their personality or lifestyle that prevents them from finding women who can fulfill this need in their vanilla dating life.",

He has absolutely zero concept of discretion.  When he shows up he tries to kiss me because \"I've missed you so much, I just can't wait for a kiss\"... right in front of my 80+ year old neighbour's living room window.  He's generally a great SD, reliable, generous, respectful, and he treats me really well. He just has absolutely no class or concept of the idea that maybe PDA isn't appropriate in the extremely conservative neighbourhood I live in, especially not in front of the nosiest neighbour on my street (she's retired and as far as I can tell has no friends or hobbies besides spying on the entire street, lol).",

To suggest wanting a private SR is some type of sin, when nearly all effective SR's have some level of discretion and privacy, is a misrepresentation of SR dating to begin with.\n\nTo suggest not wanting something to feel transactional means anything other than both parties not wanting it to feel like prostitution is dishonest. This is the hallmark of SA, and literally any conversation I have ever had with POTs. Nobody wants it to feel transactional. \n\nSuggesting to your SB you want to buy her nice clothes doesn't mean you think she dresses like a hooker, it could just mean I want to buy you something nice. \n\nAnd again, I very specifically stated that OP was generalizing SD's.

Sometimes they're attractive, sometimes they're not.  \n\n\nThey lead with 'I don't have a problem getting sex without paying for it' to either set an expectation anchor for the SB that she's not getting an allowance or to make them feel better about being on the site. Regardless, the conversation generally leads to the fact that they want to put in the minimum effort (paying for coffee/dinner) in order to get an on-demand booty-call girlfriend without any of the commitment or emotional expectation of an ongoing relationship.  \n\n\nThese guys may genuinely not have problems meeting women, but they want to get to sex as quickly as possible or lower the risk of multiple encounters with random women. My observation is that the really attractive and successful men have some other problem with their personality or lifestyle that prevents them from finding women who can fulfill this need in their vanilla dating life.",

To suggest wanting a private SR is some type of sin, when nearly all effective SR's have some level of discretion and privacy, is a misrepresentation of SR dating to begin with.\n\nTo suggest not wanting something to feel transactional means anything other than both parties not wanting it to feel like prostitution is dishonest. This is the hallmark of SA, and literally any conversation I have ever had with POTs. Nobody wants it to feel transactional. \n\nSuggesting to your SB you want to buy her nice clothes doesn't mean you think she dresses like a hooker, it could just mean I want to buy you something nice. \n\nAnd again, I very specifically stated that OP was generalizing SD's. I never implied his post was an attack on me, in fact, HE implied his post was an attack on me.",
