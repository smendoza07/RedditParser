The nearly immortals are together because they're the only 2 that can really fight eachother on the same level. Itachi and Kisame don't fight because Itachi is a pacifist and Kisame doesn't wanna fuck with Itachi. Sasori and Deidara is probably the only one based on abilities and fighting style. Gotta remember, none of them really WANT to work together, for the most part the only incentive they have to work together is the fact they get to fight strong ninja when trying to take the tailed beasts.",
