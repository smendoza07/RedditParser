A reoccurring theme of the universe is losing the people who are supposed to protect you, and carrying on their will. Just like Ino and Shikamaru's fathers died, just like Neji's father, Sauske's parents and shit his entire clan, Naruto lost his family the day he was born, and then went on to lose Jiraya. Lee losing his \"father figure\" would have fit in with the theme than killing off Neji. Plus, imagine Neji having an influence on Boruto in the next gen? All Guy does is be a fun nod to Shippuden. Nenji could have played a huge role seeing as he'd be directly related to the protaginist.",

A reoccurring theme of the universe is losing the people who are supposed to protect you, and carrying on their will. Just like Ino and Shikamaru's fathers died, just like Neji's father, Sauske's parents and shit his entire clan, Naruto lost his family the day he was born, and then went on to lose Jiraya. Lee losing his \"father figure\" would have fit in with the theme than killing off Neji. Plus, imagine Neji having an influence on Boruto in the next gen? All Guy does is be a fun nod to Shippuden. Nenji could have played a huge role seeing as he'd be directly related to the protaginist.",

Lee losing his \"father figure\" would have fit in with the theme than killing off Neji. Plus, imagine Neji having an influence on Boruto in the next gen? All Guy does is be a fun nod to Shippuden.

In my mind, you could have an artificial muscle be powerful from the get go, but able to adapt using similar techniques to the human body. If the whole nanobots in the bloodstream thing happens IRL id imaging just about anything is possible at that point. \n\nSo maybe if such a thing existed, Gai would take it and figure out how to push it to 3000% of spec through training and the power of middle-aged YOOOOUTHHHH!

A reoccurring theme of the universe is losing the people who are supposed to protect you, and carrying on their will. Just like Ino and Shikamaru's fathers died, just like Neji's father, Sauske's parents and shit his entire clan, Naruto lost his family the day he was born, and then went on to lose Jiraya. Lee losing his \"father figure\" would have fit in with the theme than killing off Neji. Plus, imagine Neji having an influence on Boruto in the next gen? All Guy does is be a fun nod to Shippuden. Nenji could have played a huge role seeing as he'd be directly related to the protaginist.",
