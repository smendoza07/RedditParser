    "body": "I find small things that are insanely handy on Amazon and order an extra for my SB.  So this week a power back up for her cell phone and an iphone stand.  She mentioned the one mini skirt I bought her is the first skirt she has owned since cheer squad.  So I ordered two mini skirts to bring along next date.  When I sent her pics she chose two more pieces that I ordered too.  A skirt on Amazon is like $14, crazy cheap.\n\nWe have been dating Saturdays from noon to 3 so we get a hotel and she keeps it for the night since she still lives at home.  This week she invited her girlfriends over for a pool and wine party and one of them already wants to sugar too so she may join us on a future date.  \n\nI try to always bring some small surprise along on dates.  She gets all the gift cards I receive.  Somehow it came up that she did not have enough quarters in her car or for wash so I got her two containers at Container Store and filled them with quarters. This stuff does not actually amount to much on spending but it keeps us more engaged and she enjoys the steady attention.  Not to mention she will model the skirts at the hotel for me which is not terrible.",

Target gift cards,  Gas cards,send them Dinner from Door Dash, etc.   One of my SB\u2019s has a 5 year old son so we did all his back to school shopping for clothes, shoes, backpack, etc.  He\u2019s looking fly and she was grateful.  \n\nI am very protective by nature and I live near the mountains so one of the first things I do is get them a little safety kit for their car that has flairs, chains, jumper cables,  a AAA membership,  a stun gun and bear spray. \nI get a cell phone signal booster. \nThen I get their phone screen fixed because it\u2019s always cracked. \ud83d\ude02",

The money spent won\u2019t even show up as a blip in my books when I tally them at year end.\n\nThe important thing for SBs who are at the other end of this generosity is to be grateful vs feel entitled. A guy who is helping is doing out of goodness and affection and not because he is now hooked on to you as a drug.  Many SBs make mistakes here and start sabotaging the SR by showing entitlement behavior.",
