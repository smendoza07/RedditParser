I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time. I highly doubt any of the \"anime canon\" episodes in Boruto will have any sort of impact on the series as a whole at all",

I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time. I highly doubt any of the \"anime canon\" episodes in Boruto will have any sort of impact on the series as a whole at all",

I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time. I highly doubt any of the \"anime canon\" episodes in Boruto will have any sort of impact on the series as a whole at all",

I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time. I highly doubt any of the \"anime canon\" episodes in Boruto will have any sort of impact on the series as a whole at all",

I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time. I highly doubt any of the \"anime canon\" episodes in Boruto will have any sort of impact on the series as a whole at all",

I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time.

I will agree the whole \"anime canon\" thing is just a way to get people to watch the anime so Perriot doesn't feel like they're wasting time, money and resources on the Boruto. imo anything that isn't manga canon, i.e. directly from the pages of the Boruto manga, is a complete waste of time. I highly doubt any of the \"anime canon\" episodes in Boruto will have any sort of impact on the series as a whole at all",
