It's clear they are all runningman fans. \n\nMy favourite part was the next game when one of his teammate messed up and he starts berating her about it. And she said \"what about the gateball mess up earlier?\" and Kwangsoo in classic runningman character just calmly answered, \"that was ages ago\" lol it was literally 5 minutes ago!\n\nBonus was the Papua New Guinea answer much later.\n\nKwangsoo and Lee Dongwook, who also  has alot of variety experience with Roommates and Produce x 101, is so much fun to watch just having fun and making fun of their seniors thus guiding them in the world of variety. \n\nEagerly waiting for the next episode.\n\nps. it would have been more chaotic if Somin was there.",
