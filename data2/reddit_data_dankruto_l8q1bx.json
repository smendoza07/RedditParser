He did wrong for right reasons, he sacrificed for the greater good, i think even Itachi would agree that what he did was wrong.

If I remember correctly it was somewhere around 20 000. Now for the Uchiha clan, they had to be big to even have a chance against such number. Not incredible, as strong ninja can decimate armies if they want, but I doubt every ninja Uchiha is on the same level as Fugaku. We also see quite a lot of Uchiha on their secret meeting. I would say it was at least 50 people. We know that only ninja were invited so if the clan was 50/50 on civilian ninja ratio we still get at least 100. The 50/50 is quite unrealisting, as that would mean on scale half of each family was an active ninja.\nNow looking at the numbers of ninja in Konoha, and the fact Uchiha had their own separate district I would say its safe to assume their numbers could easily reach 200-300 hundred. I won't say they had more becouse it is of course still a speculation.\n\nEdit: let me add to that that numbers in Naruto are horribly incostistent. Like how did we get that big of a number with 9 genin a year? Some people say there are multiple classes so ok, but then we get chuunin exams. Which give us again something around 10 people every exam so 20 chuunins a year? That's really small and it annoys me on some deep level I didn't know I had.\nIf someone has better explanation, please tell me, ease my pain.",

Im also gonna cause ALL sorts of pain for him because it will make him stronger. \n\n\nItachi is evil but sympathetic evil.  If i were to go out and kill every person in or connected to my family BUT my little brother, traumatize him with images of the family dieing repeatedly, then abandon him, I would be evil.

The show mentions that Itachi had, at a very young age, sort of developed a specific mindset about the leaf that one would usually find in a hokage trying to protect their village's people. This may seem irrelevant but the next thing that basically pushed Itachi to make the decision was probably how Shisui's plan didn't work out either. With the method he went with, he was able to save sasuke, stop a war from occuring and shoulder the responsibility all on his own. Obviously we are essentially justifying murder in this case but if you consider the different between characters like Naruto and Itachi and how they approach saving people/lives/nations, you will notice that Itachi really had no one. His family and clan had practically distanced themselves from him, his only close friend in the anbu died, his younger brother didn't no anything about what was going on and if i remember correctly, Danzo's actions behind Sarutobi's back also meant that he couldn't even trust the leadership. Narutos whole philosophy is that he brings people together to help push him towards a goal but hes one of the few characters in the show capable of drawing people towards him like that. A character like Itachi had to do the best he could with the resources he had and in order to peotect the leaf as well as his brother, he decided that the Uchiha were in the wrong and basically had them all killed.",

He did wrong for right reasons, he sacrificed for the greater good, i think even Itachi would agree that what he did was wrong.

If I remember correctly it was somewhere around 20 000. Now for the Uchiha clan, they had to be big to even have a chance against such number. Not incredible, as strong ninja can decimate armies if they want, but I doubt every ninja Uchiha is on the same level as Fugaku. We also see quite a lot of Uchiha on their secret meeting. I would say it was at least 50 people. We know that only ninja were invited so if the clan was 50/50 on civilian ninja ratio we still get at least 100. The 50/50 is quite unrealisting, as that would mean on scale half of each family was an active ninja.\nNow looking at the numbers of ninja in Konoha, and the fact Uchiha had their own separate district I would say its safe to assume their numbers could easily reach 200-300 hundred. I won't say they had more becouse it is of course still a speculation.\n\nEdit: let me add to that that numbers in Naruto are horribly incostistent. Like how did we get that big of a number with 9 genin a year? Some people say there are multiple classes so ok, but then we get chuunin exams. Which give us again something around 10 people every exam so 20 chuunins a year? That's really small and it annoys me on some deep level I didn't know I had.\nIf someone has better explanation, please tell me, ease my pain.",

The story never suggests that Itachi and his clan couldn\u2019t have discussed the their qualms with the village and averted conflict. They are still rational human beings who would there not be any issues at all if possible. However, Itachi was desperate to maintain peace, and more importantly, he didn\u2019t want anything to tarnish the Uchiha name.

The show mentions that Itachi had, at a very young age, sort of developed a specific mindset about the leaf that one would usually find in a hokage trying to protect their village's people. This may seem irrelevant but the next thing that basically pushed Itachi to make the decision was probably how Shisui's plan didn't work out either. With the method he went with, he was able to save sasuke, stop a war from occuring and shoulder the responsibility all on his own. Obviously we are essentially justifying murder in this case but if you consider the different between characters like Naruto and Itachi and how they approach saving people/lives/nations, you will notice that Itachi really had no one. His family and clan had practically distanced themselves from him, his only close friend in the anbu died, his younger brother didn't no anything about what was going on and if i remember correctly, Danzo's actions behind Sarutobi's back also meant that he couldn't even trust the leadership. Narutos whole philosophy is that he brings people together to help push him towards a goal but hes one of the few characters in the show capable of drawing people towards him like that. A character like Itachi had to do the best he could with the resources he had and in order to peotect the leaf as well as his brother, he decided that the Uchiha were in the wrong and basically had them all killed.",

He did wrong for right reasons, he sacrificed for the greater good, i think even Itachi would agree that what he did was wrong.

If I remember correctly it was somewhere around 20 000. Now for the Uchiha clan, they had to be big to even have a chance against such number. Not incredible, as strong ninja can decimate armies if they want, but I doubt every ninja Uchiha is on the same level as Fugaku. We also see quite a lot of Uchiha on their secret meeting. I would say it was at least 50 people. We know that only ninja were invited so if the clan was 50/50 on civilian ninja ratio we still get at least 100. The 50/50 is quite unrealisting, as that would mean on scale half of each family was an active ninja.\nNow looking at the numbers of ninja in Konoha, and the fact Uchiha had their own separate district I would say its safe to assume their numbers could easily reach 200-300 hundred. I won't say they had more becouse it is of course still a speculation.\n\nEdit: let me add to that that numbers in Naruto are horribly incostistent. Like how did we get that big of a number with 9 genin a year? Some people say there are multiple classes so ok, but then we get chuunin exams. Which give us again something around 10 people every exam so 20 chuunins a year? That's really small and it annoys me on some deep level I didn't know I had.\nIf someone has better explanation, please tell me, ease my pain.",

The story never suggests that Itachi and his clan couldn\u2019t have discussed the their qualms with the village and averted conflict. They are still rational human beings who would there not be any issues at all if possible. However, Itachi was desperate to maintain peace, and more importantly, he didn\u2019t want anything to tarnish the Uchiha name.

Like I said you think Hiruzen saw him as a villain. He\u2019s a hero of the village in his eyes. Not because he massacred an entire clan but because he was willing to make that decision and carry that burden, all for the sake of the village and protecting it the best way he thought he could.

PERSPECTIVE\n\nThis isn't perspective. This is Sasuke being a dumbass who blamed the village as a whole instead of Danzo who was objectively a villain regardless of perspective. To him the ends justified the means, same as Itachi and literally most major villains in the show. He and the other leadership are the sole reason the massacre even happened.",

Your only argument is that perspective doesn\u2019t matter because Itachi committed evil acts and therefore is a villain. But how do you know they were evil acts. Just because you think it was an evil act doesn\u2019t meant someone else doesn\u2019t think the opposite. How do you define evil. What you think is evil, I may not and vice versa.

If I remember correctly it was somewhere around 20 000. Now for the Uchiha clan, they had to be big to even have a chance against such number. Not incredible, as strong ninja can decimate armies if they want, but I doubt every ninja Uchiha is on the same level as Fugaku. We also see quite a lot of Uchiha on their secret meeting. I would say it was at least 50 people. We know that only ninja were invited so if the clan was 50/50 on civilian ninja ratio we still get at least 100. The 50/50 is quite unrealisting, as that would mean on scale half of each family was an active ninja.\nNow looking at the numbers of ninja in Konoha, and the fact Uchiha had their own separate district I would say its safe to assume their numbers could easily reach 200-300 hundred. I won't say they had more becouse it is of course still a speculation.\n\nEdit: let me add to that that numbers in Naruto are horribly incostistent. Like how did we get that big of a number with 9 genin a year? Some people say there are multiple classes so ok, but then we get chuunin exams. Which give us again something around 10 people every exam so 20 chuunins a year? That's really small and it annoys me on some deep level I didn't know I had.\nIf someone has better explanation, please tell me, ease my pain.",

You keep perpetuating this idea by conveniently leaving out the *reason* Itachi murders his clan. They were planning a coup which the village elders feared would cause war, and perhaps another Great War. The story never suggests that Itachi and his clan couldn\u2019t have discussed the their qualms with the village and averted conflict. They are still rational human beings who would there not be any issues at all if possible. However, Itachi was desperate to maintain peace, and more importantly, he didn\u2019t want anything to tarnish the Uchiha name. I not sure how you believe that the story  set up an absolute \u201ctrolley scenario\u201d if you will, unless you implying Kishimoto\u2019s message was \u2018one should be ready to anyone if they believe it is right\u2019, which is a fucked up message in many regards.",

Itachi was the masterplanner of the whole series, with a high level of discernment and anticipation. \n\nKilling the entire Uchiha clan with the help of Obito, and having Sasuke kill him and Obito-which didn't workout-, as a way to pay for his actions will take a lot of planning and process to achieve, without any external interference. So he planted the whole \"hate not been enough thing\" \"you are very weak\" and \"come before me with these same eyes\" in his brother to eliminate the revered view Sasuke had of him. Without all of these Sasuke would still see Itachi as his loving older brother and would've been busy searching for his brother all his life for answers.\n\nSasuke had to be prepared for the role, and also be able to receive Itachi's power. So he had to make it look like Sasuke's hate gave him the power to actually defeat him and restore the Uchiha Clan's honor.\n\nItachi's only biggest mistake was been unable to see through Obito's Madara-cloak. This made enjoy his story more for showing you can't be 100% in life",

It outright just means someones who's evil actions are relevant to. Which perfectly describes Itachi. And his actions being influenced doesn't suddenly make him not a villian.\n\n>A villain in literature isn't the same thing as a criminal, which Itachi definitely was\n\nItachi is both a villain and a criminal. Sympathetic? Yes but a villain nonetheless. Literally every other villain is just like him in the show is like him. People with good intentions committing acts of evil.",

Only an Uchiha can control the 9 tails with their Sharingan, suspicion was put on them because Obito attacked the village on his personal grudge (not even Madara\u2019s orders). \n\nObito screwed his own clan over, and afterwards they rightfully felt oppressed. Also, if not the police force what do you suggest the Uchihas do? Give them every seat in the Leaf government? Like what? What\u2019s so special about the Uchiha that makes them different from other clans? They thought they were special. Everything is under direct control of the Hokage, if they weren\u2019t police force they\u2019d be under the Hokage rule anyways. The police force gave the Uchiha authority and power.",

Tobirama's distrust of the Uchiha clan is what made them turn against the village. That's the cycle of hatred they talk about every other chapter, it's the central theme of the series and not something remotely subtle. The fact that Hashirama berates Tobirama for his treatment of the Uchiha is pretty reliable given that he founded the village by forging a peace with them. He knew the Uchiha, his brother, and the village very well so he's pretty reliable when he tells Tobirama he's being an asshole.",

Just because you think it was an evil act doesn\u2019t meant someone else doesn\u2019t think the opposite. How do you define evil. What you think is evil, I may not and vice versa.

I\u2019m arguing about philosophy and basic human nature. There is no such thing as objective evil. Your only argument is that perspective doesn\u2019t matter because Itachi committed evil acts and therefore is a villain. But how do you know they were evil acts. Just because you think it was an evil act doesn\u2019t meant someone else doesn\u2019t think the opposite. How do you define evil. What you think is evil, I may not and vice versa. Theres a lot more I could say but I\u2019ll stop here because you couldn\u2019t even grasp the idea of perspective in storytelling so probably won\u2019t even understand what I\u2019m trying to say.",
