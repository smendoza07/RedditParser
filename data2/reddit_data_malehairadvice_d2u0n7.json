                                            "body": "I have a denser classic goatee, but my moustache is almost similar to yours, plus my sides are patchy too.\n\nI think a guy who is confident and experienced enough in how certain lengths look on him, then he can pull off a very well-crafted grown AND trimmed (plus maintained) patchy beard. Like how Keanu does it most of the time (there are times he lets himself go). Either grow it out totally and then cut it the way [so that it covers patches](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ixt-jFMu--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/vldbwrlgvvic6ffnjwjm.jpg) (while still cutting the really patchy parts, like that line) PLUS use some beard wax and scissors to have a stylish look, or just go for a lighter length ([stubble](https://www.welt.de/img/english-news/mobile101932616/6102508907-ci102l-w1024/eng-reeves-gbs-BM-Bayern-HOLLYWOOD-jpg.jpg)), or even a [little longer but with clean shaven on troubled part ( I think Keanu here is a little unkempt](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/12/pjimage-7-1-920x584.jpg), maybe forgetting the wax, as hair is not just going in on direction, down, like a well waxed look).\n\nI think that [James Franco](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-11/enhanced/webdr07/6/17/enhanced-buzz-orig-7526-1383777439-33.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto) on this photo is the bad example. Franco just wanted a beard, but didn't assess his situation on WHAT he can achieve with minimal maintenance with what he has. Because he could pull off a style, but he either thought his beard is \"full\", when it's patchy as hell, or that he doesn't need to maintain a certain look (length, to be precise), so it looks unkempt as fuck.\n\nMy \"full\" beard look has a certain lenght during growth that looks marvellous for 2-3 days, but I don't have a specifically beard trimming electric razor, so I have to do with what I have. As after those marvellous 2-3 days, on the next morning I already look like a crazy hikikomori. I've also kept track of my experience, and noticed that this look comes after maybe 14 days of letting it grow on its own. I don't know the precise length at that point, but when I'll have a beard trimmer, I'll surely look into the subject in depth. You should try and observe your growth too and how you look on each morning without any shaving.",

I wouldn\u2019t shave it fully as it would make you look too young coupled with what you said.\n\nMy advice is to buy a shaver and just trim it, don\u2019t shave it. Try different settings, start from maybe second shortest? Beard grows fast so you can change it.\n\nI also would like to see more volume in your hair. Are you drying it with a hairdryer? If not use it. If you already do, try drying your hair from the bottom so you can add more volume. Maybe try using some product to add volume. I think this looks too subtle, too muted.\n\nI\u2019d say you made a good choice with the hair overall.",

Like how Keanu does it most of the time (there are times he lets himself go). Either grow it out totally and then cut it the way [so that it covers patches](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ixt-jFMu--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/vldbwrlgvvic6ffnjwjm.jpg) (while still cutting the really patchy parts, like that line) PLUS use some beard wax and scissors to have a stylish look, or just go for a lighter length ([stubble](https://www.welt.de/img/english-news/mobile101932616/6102508907-ci102l-w1024/eng-reeves-gbs-BM-Bayern-HOLLYWOOD-jpg.jpg)), or even a [little longer but with clean shaven on troubled part ( I think Keanu here is a little unkempt](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/12/pjimage-7-1-920x584.jpg), maybe forgetting the wax, as hair is not just going in on direction, down, like a well waxed look).\n\nI think that [James Franco](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-11/enhanced/webdr07/6/17/enhanced-buzz-orig-7526-1383777439-33.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto) on this photo is the bad example. Franco just wanted a beard, but didn't assess his situation on WHAT he can achieve with minimal maintenance with what he has. Because he could pull off a style, but he either thought his beard is \"full\", when it's patchy as hell, or that he doesn't need to maintain a certain look (length, to be precise), so it looks unkempt as fuck.\n\nMy \"full\" beard look has a certain lenght during growth that looks marvellous for 2-3 days, but I don't have a specifically beard trimming electric razor, so I have to do with what I have. As after those marvellous 2-3 days, on the next morning I already look like a crazy hikikomori. I've also kept track of my experience, and noticed that this look comes after maybe 14 days of letting it grow on its own. I don't know the precise length at that point, but when I'll have a beard trimmer, I'll surely look into the subject in depth. You should try and observe your growth too and how you look on each morning without any shaving.",

Like how Keanu does it most of the time (there are times he lets himself go). Either grow it out totally and then cut it the way [so that it covers patches](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ixt-jFMu--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/vldbwrlgvvic6ffnjwjm.jpg) (while still cutting the really patchy parts, like that line) PLUS use some beard wax and scissors to have a stylish look, or just go for a lighter length ([stubble](https://www.welt.de/img/english-news/mobile101932616/6102508907-ci102l-w1024/eng-reeves-gbs-BM-Bayern-HOLLYWOOD-jpg.jpg)), or even a [little longer but with clean shaven on troubled part ( I think Keanu here is a little unkempt](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/12/pjimage-7-1-920x584.jpg), maybe forgetting the wax, as hair is not just going in on direction, down, like a well waxed look).\n\nI think that [James Franco](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-11/enhanced/webdr07/6/17/enhanced-buzz-orig-7526-1383777439-33.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto) on this photo is the bad example. Franco just wanted a beard, but didn't assess his situation on WHAT he can achieve with minimal maintenance with what he has. Because he could pull off a style, but he either thought his beard is \"full\", when it's patchy as hell, or that he doesn't need to maintain a certain look (length, to be precise), so it looks unkempt as fuck.\n\nMy \"full\" beard look has a certain lenght during growth that looks marvellous for 2-3 days, but I don't have a specifically beard trimming electric razor, so I have to do with what I have. As after those marvellous 2-3 days, on the next morning I already look like a crazy hikikomori. I've also kept track of my experience, and noticed that this look comes after maybe 14 days of letting it grow on its own. I don't know the precise length at that point, but when I'll have a beard trimmer, I'll surely look into the subject in depth. You should try and observe your growth too and how you look on each morning without any shaving.",

Franco just wanted a beard, but didn't assess his situation on WHAT he can achieve with minimal maintenance with what he has. Because he could pull off a style, but he either thought his beard is \"full\", when it's patchy as hell, or that he doesn't need to maintain a certain look (length, to be precise), so it looks unkempt as fuck.\n\nMy \"full\" beard look has a certain lenght during growth that looks marvellous for 2-3 days, but I don't have a specifically beard trimming electric razor, so I have to do with what I have. As after those marvellous 2-3 days, on the next morning I already look like a crazy hikikomori. I've also kept track of my experience, and noticed that this look comes after maybe 14 days of letting it grow on its own. I don't know the precise length at that point, but when I'll have a beard trimmer, I'll surely look into the subject in depth. You should try and observe your growth too and how you look on each morning without any shaving.",
