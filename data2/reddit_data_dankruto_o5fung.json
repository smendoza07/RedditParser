All you see is the orphan that needs to be protected, but I don't need your pity or for you to lie to me.\"\n\nSo many of the heavy scenes in Naruto are great but the dialogue falls short.\n\nu/WindyCityAssassin2",

He's basically asexual/aromantic, but not because of natural causes but his brother fucking his mind up. (**Note**: Asexuality/Aromantic isn't a crack if its natural, but we see with the character that he was broken mentally by his brother. I know it's post-2016 but please take context when reading this). \n\nNaruto is the too long leg, he overcompensates and has too much love to give. Dude needs to chill out and realize that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. \n\nSakura is the leg that could be useful but has way too many short comings to actually be useful. Even if the other two are fixed, this leg will always be too short and it needs to \"grow\" in order to be of use to the team.",

However, dying for someone, especially the main character's \"love\" interest, isn't the Hyuga controlling his fate but Hinata showing that the main branch is on the same level as him. It would be Hinata, not the family, making the sacrifice (since the family would be losing Hinata in the process).\n\nAlso, great poetic irony with their fathers and all that.",

Also Hinata kinda died once already for him in the Pain saga. Obviously, magically brought back to life xD\nI agree, actually what you are suggesting would have been better ending to the huga storyline that seem to have been dropped in Shippuden until the eventual Neji's \"sacrifice\". However, I think to have another loved one sacrifice their life for him not sure if it would have good impact on him. If the show had gone that route, I would think Naruto becomes Hokage but no boruto follow which is quite a positive outcome.\nOverall, the show could have been better in some ways just as our discussion shows.\nP.S. is DVorah in your username from MK?",

I personally do not like Neji's death as I think it was more of a cop out than an actual sacrifice which couldn't be avoided. For comparison both Kakashi and Gai have had situation where they escaped near death or death situation by lets call it plot convenience. Neji's death wasn't as meaningful as it should have been. That being said Hinata saving Neji with her highly developed skills would have been more impactful (even for their relationship). Hinata then could have made Neji the head of the clan while she become the well deserved companion for Naruto.\n\nI think Hiashi is the person most people have dying in Neji's place. It's also kind of redundant with the whole Pain Arc where she almost died and makes it feel cheap. Also does her whole character dirty. Hiashi seems like a better choice imo",

He's basically asexual/aromantic, but not because of natural causes but his brother fucking his mind up. (**Note**: Asexuality/Aromantic isn't a crack if its natural, but we see with the character that he was broken mentally by his brother. I know it's post-2016 but please take context when reading this). \n\nNaruto is the too long leg, he overcompensates and has too much love to give. Dude needs to chill out and realize that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. \n\nSakura is the leg that could be useful but has way too many short comings to actually be useful. Even if the other two are fixed, this leg will always be too short and it needs to \"grow\" in order to be of use to the team.",

However, dying for someone, especially the main character's \"love\" interest, isn't the Hyuga controlling his fate but Hinata showing that the main branch is on the same level as him. It would be Hinata, not the family, making the sacrifice (since the family would be losing Hinata in the process).\n\nAlso, great poetic irony with their fathers and all that.",

Also Hinata kinda died once already for him in the Pain saga. Obviously, magically brought back to life xD\nI agree, actually what you are suggesting would have been better ending to the huga storyline that seem to have been dropped in Shippuden until the eventual Neji's \"sacrifice\". However, I think to have another loved one sacrifice their life for him not sure if it would have good impact on him. If the show had gone that route, I would think Naruto becomes Hokage but no boruto follow which is quite a positive outcome.\nOverall, the show could have been better in some ways just as our discussion shows.\nP.S. is DVorah in your username from MK?",

It's also kind of redundant with the whole Pain Arc where she almost died and makes it feel cheap. Also does her whole character dirty. Hiashi seems like a better choice imo",

He's basically asexual/aromantic, but not because of natural causes but his brother fucking his mind up. (**Note**: Asexuality/Aromantic isn't a crack if its natural, but we see with the character that he was broken mentally by his brother. I know it's post-2016 but please take context when reading this). \n\nNaruto is the too long leg, he overcompensates and has too much love to give. Dude needs to chill out and realize that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. \n\nSakura is the leg that could be useful but has way too many short comings to actually be useful. Even if the other two are fixed, this leg will always be too short and it needs to \"grow\" in order to be of use to the team.",

However, dying for someone, especially the main character's \"love\" interest, isn't the Hyuga controlling his fate but Hinata showing that the main branch is on the same level as him.

Also Hinata kinda died once already for him in the Pain saga. Obviously, magically brought back to life xD\nI agree, actually what you are suggesting would have been better ending to the huga storyline that seem to have been dropped in Shippuden until the eventual Neji's \"sacrifice\". However, I think to have another loved one sacrifice their life for him not sure if it would have good impact on him. If the show had gone that route, I would think Naruto becomes Hokage but no boruto follow which is quite a positive outcome.\nOverall, the show could have been better in some ways just as our discussion shows.\nP.S. is DVorah in your username from MK?",

Neji has significance, despite being a lesser character, cause he was part of a defining moment for Naruto.\n\nHiashi means nothing to Naruto or the reader and him dying doesn't show any change in the Hyuga except Neji dies when he leader tells him he gets to die. Plus the old are supposed to sacrifice for the next generation.\n\nHinata, while main branch, is not his leader. Hinata sees Neji as a brother first and we know this.\n\nSeems like people like Hinata so they always try to figure another person to die there but the only one that has any real weight would be Hinata... Especially since she already died, got to say her final words, and won't be coming back this time.",

Hiashi, the leader dying for a Branch memeber can show how the Main Branch is now equal. I personally think that Neji was a good person to die, since he was one of the best characters. It was the execution and his criminal lack of screentime that made it bad for me. And yah, I just don't want Hinata to die XD",

Neji dying shows that fate has decreed he die like his father before him. \n\nHinata dying isn't a Hyuga dying for Neji or a main branch member dying for Neji. Hinata dying for Neji is a sister dying for her brother first and foremost.\n\nHinata was being propped up as Naruto's future and her actually dying raises the stakes incredibly. Now you got to wonder who else is allowed to die, Neji is a tertiary character and Hiashi is even further down the list but Hinata? She's a secondary character from her connection to Naruto and the shipping being done. \n\nAlso it hits Naruto way harder. Realizing he had plenty of chances to just, pay attention, to Hinata but didn't is much deeper to Naruto's character.\n\nNeji's death was used as a cheap throw away. If the story was named \"Hinata\" then I could see where that scene was coming from, but that ain't the series.",

(**Note**: Asexuality/Aromantic isn't a crack if its natural, but we see with the character that he was broken mentally by his brother. I know it's post-2016 but please take context when reading this). \n\nNaruto is the too long leg, he overcompensates and has too much love to give. Dude needs to chill out and realize that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. \n\nSakura is the leg that could be useful but has way too many short comings to actually be useful. Even if the other two are fixed, this leg will always be too short and it needs to \"grow\" in order to be of use to the team.",

However, dying for someone, especially the main character's \"love\" interest, isn't the Hyuga controlling his fate but Hinata showing that the main branch is on the same level as him.

Also Hinata kinda died once already for him in the Pain saga. Obviously, magically brought back to life xD\nI agree, actually what you are suggesting would have been better ending to the huga storyline that seem to have been dropped in Shippuden until the eventual Neji's \"sacrifice\". However, I think to have another loved one sacrifice their life for him not sure if it would have good impact on him. If the show had gone that route, I would think Naruto becomes Hokage but no boruto follow which is quite a positive outcome.\nOverall, the show could have been better in some ways just as our discussion shows.\nP.S. is DVorah in your username from MK?",

Neji has significance, despite being a lesser character, cause he was part of a defining moment for Naruto.\n\nHiashi means nothing to Naruto or the reader and him dying doesn't show any change in the Hyuga except Neji dies when he leader tells him he gets to die. Plus the old are supposed to sacrifice for the next generation.\n\nHinata, while main branch, is not his leader. Hinata sees Neji as a brother first and we know this.\n\nSeems like people like Hinata so they always try to figure another person to die there but the only one that has any real weight would be Hinata... Especially since she already died, got to say her final words, and won't be coming back this time.",

It was the execution and his criminal lack of screentime that made it bad for me. And yah, I just don't want Hinata to die XD",

Neji dying shows that fate has decreed he die like his father before him. \n\nHinata dying isn't a Hyuga dying for Neji or a main branch member dying for Neji. Hinata dying for Neji is a sister dying for her brother first and foremost.\n\nHinata was being propped up as Naruto's future and her actually dying raises the stakes incredibly. Now you got to wonder who else is allowed to die, Neji is a tertiary character and Hiashi is even further down the list but Hinata? She's a secondary character from her connection to Naruto and the shipping being done. \n\nAlso it hits Naruto way harder. Realizing he had plenty of chances to just, pay attention, to Hinata but didn't is much deeper to Naruto's character.\n\nNeji's death was used as a cheap throw away. If the story was named \"Hinata\" then I could see where that scene was coming from, but that ain't the series.",

(**Note**: Asexuality/Aromantic isn't a crack if its natural, but we see with the character that he was broken mentally by his brother. I know it's post-2016 but please take context when reading this). \n\nNaruto is the too long leg, he overcompensates and has too much love to give. Dude needs to chill out and realize that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. \n\nSakura is the leg that could be useful but has way too many short comings to actually be useful. Even if the other two are fixed, this leg will always be too short and it needs to \"grow\" in order to be of use to the team.",

Also Hinata kinda died once already for him in the Pain saga. Obviously, magically brought back to life xD\nI agree, actually what you are suggesting would have been better ending to the huga storyline that seem to have been dropped in Shippuden until the eventual Neji's \"sacrifice\". However, I think to have another loved one sacrifice their life for him not sure if it would have good impact on him. If the show had gone that route, I would think Naruto becomes Hokage but no boruto follow which is quite a positive outcome.\nOverall, the show could have been better in some ways just as our discussion shows.\nP.S. is DVorah in your username from MK?",

Neji has significance, despite being a lesser character, cause he was part of a defining moment for Naruto.\n\nHiashi means nothing to Naruto or the reader and him dying doesn't show any change in the Hyuga except Neji dies when he leader tells him he gets to die. Plus the old are supposed to sacrifice for the next generation.\n\nHinata, while main branch, is not his leader. Hinata sees Neji as a brother first and we know this.\n\nSeems like people like Hinata so they always try to figure another person to die there but the only one that has any real weight would be Hinata... Especially since she already died, got to say her final words, and won't be coming back this time.",

Neji dying shows that fate has decreed he die like his father before him. \n\nHinata dying isn't a Hyuga dying for Neji or a main branch member dying for Neji. Hinata dying for Neji is a sister dying for her brother first and foremost.\n\nHinata was being propped up as Naruto's future and her actually dying raises the stakes incredibly. Now you got to wonder who else is allowed to die, Neji is a tertiary character and Hiashi is even further down the list but Hinata? She's a secondary character from her connection to Naruto and the shipping being done. \n\nAlso it hits Naruto way harder. Realizing he had plenty of chances to just, pay attention, to Hinata but didn't is much deeper to Naruto's character.\n\nNeji's death was used as a cheap throw away. If the story was named \"Hinata\" then I could see where that scene was coming from, but that ain't the series.",

Neji dying shows that fate has decreed he die like his father before him. \n\nHinata dying isn't a Hyuga dying for Neji or a main branch member dying for Neji. Hinata dying for Neji is a sister dying for her brother first and foremost.\n\nHinata was being propped up as Naruto's future and her actually dying raises the stakes incredibly. Now you got to wonder who else is allowed to die, Neji is a tertiary character and Hiashi is even further down the list but Hinata? She's a secondary character from her connection to Naruto and the shipping being done. \n\nAlso it hits Naruto way harder. Realizing he had plenty of chances to just, pay attention, to Hinata but didn't is much deeper to Naruto's character.\n\nNeji's death was used as a cheap throw away. If the story was named \"Hinata\" then I could see where that scene was coming from, but that ain't the series.",
