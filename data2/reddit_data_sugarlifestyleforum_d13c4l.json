    "body": "Okay, dicks may be a strong word. But probably accurate.\n\nIn civilian life, I am a generous, patient and kind person. I volunteer coach for local youth soccer, donate to charities and make sure my employees have a comfy life with a nice holiday bonus.\n\nIn the bowl, my walls are tall and generosity dries up when on the website. I'm put on a hard outer shell because my thoughtful tendencies get leveraged by nearly every single SB.\n\nIn the past **week** of searching for an arrangement, the following requests have resulted in 9/10 of local babies asking for money / favors **before meeting**:\n\n* Baby 1: Car payment was late ($290), needed it paid to make it to m&g. Sent proof of payment and verified via video chat. Didn't send money, declined to move forward.\n* Baby 2: Asked for ($80) funds to get 'presentable' for a m&g. Next.\n* Baby 3: Desperately needed money to avoid getting kicked out of her room rental ($600). Next.\n* Baby 4: Needed to borrow my truck or get help renting a moving vehicle so she could move back in with parents after being evicted ($100 estimated). No thank you.\n* Baby 5: Didn't ask for money, went to a nice lunch together at a local restaurant. **Looking good here!**\n* Baby 6: Was living behind a dumpster and needed ($350) for a weekly rental. Stunned... next.\n* Baby 7: Met for coffee, asked if I wanted to buy her and her girlfriend (whom hadn't been mentioned before this moment) some prepaid phones to talk and text me videos on. Thanks but no thanks.\n* Baby 8: Met for lunch, was told she would be platonic only, but needed someone to buy her a laptop and webcam setup to launch a cam girl business and was hoping I would be an investor for her. Did not bring prospectus. Next.\n* Baby 9: Was locked out of her room for not paying utility bills to her roommate, needed ($300) to get 'everything she owned in her life' back. Advised her to call the sheriff department. Then politely nexted.\n* Baby 10: Went well, local, amazing, and then dropped the bomb she needed a place to stay because her 'ex' was stalking her after she got an abortion without telling him. Not completely sure if it was a scam since she was just looking for a place to crash and never asked for cash. Probably playing the long game. Next.\n\nAs you can see, the bowl can turn a generous, nice person into a dick. If there is any lesson to this rant, it's that there might be a nice guy underneath the hard shell, just don't push for his generosity upfront and coax it out over time.\n\nThanks for reading, hope all of you lovely people are enjoying a nice weekend!",

            "body": "Man, I think we all get the inappropriate $/gift requests, but your ratio is the worst I've ever seen!\n\nI have a slightly different way I think about things.  I am not a dick in real life, and I'm not a dick on Seeking.  But \"not being a dick\" does not require that you be stupid or a willing victim.  As soon as I get the inappropriate request, I next her.  I absolutely do not think I'm being a dick for that.  More importantly, after I next her, I do not get angry or rant, and it does not color the way I interact with my next SB -- at all.  Each SB gets treated with straightforward niceness, and often it stays that way.  For anyone who shows themselves as toxic, manipulators, scammers, etc., they get nexted, and I do my best never to think about it again.  Because I'm so immediate in acting whenever one of my lines is crossed, there's a chance I have, from time to time, next'ed a naive newbie who inadvertently gave toxic-SB signals, but I'm okay with that.  It's prolonged interactions with negative people that tends to bring me down and make me less nice, so I don't do it.",

BUT, if you are running into these women consistently, what is your criteria when you are searching? \n\nAre you going for the youngest age or the prettiest face? Do you actually read their profile and find something that appeals to you?\n\nI have spoken with SDs mid 40s and up who have decided to tell me about their prior negative experience (never asked to know). All of them were chasing 18/19yr olds. \n\nI'm not judging, you do you (to all the SDs), but when you are looking so young you have to appreciate you are going to run into more of these scenarios. That isn't to suggest all young women this age are scammers, not at all. But they are the generation being fed by social media and we all have seen the type of bullshit influencers are spouting about what you can get for free. \n\nI personally don't engage with SDs profiles who have an age range seeking 18-22yr olds as I feel if they think they will have more in common with the younger generation, then they and I won't relate at all. Again, not judging, you like what you like.",

It is hard sometimes not to get completely bitter, but I just remember the amazing experiences I've had and the ex-sds I'm still friends with, and I keep in mind that this is what I signed up for. It's worth it for now \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9c",

The college girl who became insanely busy the second the rent check cleared but she must of forgot we were connected on social because her nightly partying told a different story.\n\nOr the single mom who gave me a hard luck story about not being to afford her kids birth certificate or their own place only to be told after that payment was done that she scams dudes on SA for money.\n\nGood times and hard lessons.\n\nThe biggest thing I took away from it is I couldn't control their situation but I could control mine so I started targeting old women (post college), when they asked for money immediately or presented their life as a dumpster fire - I passed and moved on quickly.\n\nAs a result I find myself with more single moms and less college aged women. For some reason, despite being on every social platform known to man + a few others, college age women seem to have forgotten how to respond to text, send a selfie (non nude of course to prove their real and I'm not being catfished - btw I already know they are all real due to social media, I just want to see if the girl will send the photo or if she treats my text and request like a chore).\n\nAt the end of the day I could drive myself nuts trying to figure why people act the way they do. It's a one sided guess and to be fair a lot of these women are in a place in their life where they are doing anything to survive.\n\nAnd finally this - my current SB is one who hit me up back then and needed $200 to help her move. She came over, we had fun and I thought that was the end of it. Short story long 3 months later she's moved back into town, it's some of the best and most connected sex of my life, and we might actually turn this into a SBF/SGF situation.\n\nEvery rose has its thorn type shit huh?\n\nGood luck to you sir, I feel your pain and hopefully with some slight adjustments better days are ahead!",

And others don't start out trying to take advantage of you, but they need help and you help them, and then they hate to admit they needed help, so they kind of shit on you over time. \n\nYou want to try to stay generous and caring, but over time, you start second-guessing anyone who says they need help.

I would guess that the absolute number of traditional SBs and SDs on the site is still the same, or increasing at a normal rate, but the total number of people on the site has grown dramatically. There seem to be a lot more platonics, pros, and toe dippers, for example. The result is that one has to sift through many more profiles to find someone legitimate and interested. It sounds like you hit a bad streak of 9 out of 10 POTs looking for free money one way or the other. But you may have better luck with the next 100 profiles, or the 100 after that, or the 100 after that. It's a numbers game. Good luck!",

It's just too transactional and reminds me why I hate escort type arrangements.\n\nGood summary. Keep an open mind and also it's actually nice that these bottom feeders, out themselves. It's time saved, I just don't respond or end discussion quickly and move on.\n\nThank God, there's no shortage of new girls that are also not greedy and are looking for a genuine connection.\n\n\\-------------\n\nEdit: There's one exception of wanting cash for a basic coffee meet. That's if I'm really ugly/fat/repugnant, but I'm not. I can pick up any girl but don't want the blurry line of date/relationship (SB/SD sets it clear from the start). I mean I look more stylish and polished then most of these girls, yet she still has the nerve to ask for cash for a coffee intro meet?!
