If you square it off slightly in the front, it gives it a more defined look and will have a very different effect. You can shorten it or grow it out, but those defined edges will make it look like an entirely different beard. As far as the hair, I'm all about the Captain America look from Infinity War. It keeps some length but is also a very clean and classy look. It is also relatively versatile, so you can style it differently day to day.",
