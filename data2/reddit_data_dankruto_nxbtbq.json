If Lee just kept away from him when he activated it he would have dried himself up. \nAnd if gaara did resort to using the 1 tail chakra after that then in the chunin exams base lee would be equal to gaara in tailed beast form, which is a feat in itself. Even kankuro said that armor was his biggest weakness and is a last resort.",

Naruto and Sasuke getting the Indra and Ashura power up just ruins the whole theme of the series. Although Madara absolutely bodied both of them in their respective pre six paths forms. So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic. The final fight would've also been way better without the mech battle. I don't hate it as much as other people, but I'm not the biggest fan either.",

Naruto and Sasuke getting the Indra and Ashura power up just ruins the whole theme of the series. Although Madara absolutely bodied both of them in their respective pre six paths forms. So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic. The final fight would've also been way better without the mech battle. I don't hate it as much as other people, but I'm not the biggest fan either.",

Naruto and Sasuke getting the Indra and Ashura power up just ruins the whole theme of the series. Although Madara absolutely bodied both of them in their respective pre six paths forms. So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic. The final fight would've also been way better without the mech battle. I don't hate it as much as other people, but I'm not the biggest fan either.",

Naruto and Sasuke getting the Indra and Ashura power up just ruins the whole theme of the series. Although Madara absolutely bodied both of them in their respective pre six paths forms. So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic. The final fight would've also been way better without the mech battle. I don't hate it as much as other people, but I'm not the biggest fan either.",

So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic.

So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic.

Naruto and Sasuke getting the Indra and Ashura power up just ruins the whole theme of the series. Although Madara absolutely bodied both of them in their respective pre six paths forms. So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic. The final fight would've also been way better without the mech battle. I don't hate it as much as other people, but I'm not the biggest fan either.",

So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic.

So they need some type of power up, or maybe a minor powerup and a strategy. I would have prefered the later. Maybe they could've had a combo of 2 sharingan kakashi, guy, Naruto and Sasuke face off against Madara. That would have been epic.
