    "body": "I went to a M&G with a POT and it was fine. No significant chemistry, no significant awkwardness, just plain \"meh.\" \nI wasnt really attracted to him, but he seemed non-threatening so I did meet up for a physical meeting later. The sex was fun, but nothing crazy, blah blah blah. \nThe reason I'm giving you all of this useless backstory is because you should know that I had no particular attachment to him. He paid decently. \nAnyways, he asked me stimulate his testicles with my mouth. I told him \"No, I do not want to do that\" \nHe kind of looked at me, and then dropped it and we continued with no issues. \nYOU CAN SAY NO. \nYou do not have to do ANYTHING that you do not want to do. Consent to sex is NOT consenting to every sexual act that they can think of. Just because they line your pockets does not mean that they can do whatever they want. \nSDs worthwhile will not question this or pressure you. If he does not respect your right to consent, he does not respect you and you are putting yourself in a dangerous situation. \nNo one ever talks about this and it is so important. \n",

Make a SB profile and take a look sometime, it is not easy to find a man on there who is objectively attractive and even harder to find one who gives an allowance. Your SB's would not be with you without allowance. That doesn't mean that they don't want to be having sex with you but just that attraction develops over time and in the bowl, is more than just purely physical. \n\nOP didn't say she found him *unattractive*. She said that she wasn't actively attracted to him physically and didn't particularly feel chemistry (understandable since she hardly knows the guy). Life isn't a fairytale where sparks immediately fly and there is a sizzling, palpable chemistry on the M&G. I've never felt that way about any of my SD's initially but kindness, compatibility, laughter and generosity go a long way and have ensured that all my SR's are long term - even without an initial wild attraction.

Make a SB profile and take a look sometime, it is not easy to find a man on there who is objectively attractive and even harder to find one who gives an allowance. Your SB's would not be with you without allowance. That doesn't mean that they don't want to be having sex with you but just that attraction develops over time and in the bowl, is more than just purely physical. \n\nOP didn't say she found him *unattractive*. She said that she wasn't actively attracted to him physically and didn't particularly feel chemistry (understandable since she hardly knows the guy). Life isn't a fairytale where sparks immediately fly and there is a sizzling, palpable chemistry on the M&G. I've never felt that way about any of my SD's initially but kindness, compatibility, laughter and generosity go a long way and have ensured that all my SR's are long term - even without an initial wild attraction.
