He also had one half of Kyuubi (And they were friends, hence KCM2), so, match EMS to KCM2, and Rinnegan to So6P. Then Sasuke absorbed the Bijuu Chakra and also some from Naruto, to counter that, Naruto made Shadow Clones (whose power is roughly the same as the jutsu caster) and absorbed all the Nature Energy that Kurama could collect in that time. Nature Energy and Sage Mode is no joke, it made Naruto from weaker-than-Deidara level to Pain level in early shippuden\n\nEDIT: Naruto also had multiple Gudodama, that he mostly used defensively, had he used them for offense, I don't think Sasuke could've done a lot against Naruto.",

Then Sasuke absorbed the Bijuu Chakra and also some from Naruto, to counter that, Naruto made Shadow Clones (whose power is roughly the same as the jutsu caster) and absorbed all the Nature Energy that Kurama could collect in that time. Nature Energy and Sage Mode is no joke, it made Naruto from weaker-than-Deidara level to Pain level in early shippuden\n\nEDIT: Naruto also had multiple Gudodama, that he mostly used defensively, had he used them for offense, I don't think Sasuke could've done a lot against Naruto.",

Then Sasuke absorbed the Bijuu Chakra and also some from Naruto, to counter that, Naruto made Shadow Clones (whose power is roughly the same as the jutsu caster) and absorbed all the Nature Energy that Kurama could collect in that time. Nature Energy and Sage Mode is no joke, it made Naruto from weaker-than-Deidara level to Pain level in early shippuden\n\nEDIT: Naruto also had multiple Gudodama, that he mostly used defensively, had he used them for offense, I don't think Sasuke could've done a lot against Naruto.",

Nature Energy and Sage Mode is no joke, it made Naruto from weaker-than-Deidara level to Pain level in early shippuden\n\nEDIT: Naruto also had multiple Gudodama, that he mostly used defensively, had he used them for offense, I don't think Sasuke could've done a lot against Naruto.",
