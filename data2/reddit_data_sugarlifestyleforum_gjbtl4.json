    "body": "So it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been on a date with someone who has manners. I met my SD last night. We live in a country area so there isn\u2019t much to do around there. But the whole time he was so considerate and asking if I needed anything when we stopped for gas/food/Walmart (Walmart is where we met up). We basically drove around in his truck for like 5 hours and talked. We met in the city where he went to college so it was like a trip down memory lane and we went for a little hike too! The amount of times he opened my door for me took me off guard because it\u2019s been so long since someone has done that for me. We clicked right off the bat and we were laughing just about the entire time! He opened the sun roof, blasted the music and had me stand on the seats while he drove. I haven\u2019t laughed that much in such a long time. And the crazy part... we didn\u2019t even get intimate last night. The most was just a kiss on the cheek good night. He was so respectful of my boundaries and wanted to just get to know each other first. \nGuys I think I scored the jackpot, I\u2019m so happy about my date and I can\u2019t stop smiling about how much fun I had!\nEdit: I forgot to mention how attractive he is! And he\u2019s only 37!!!",
