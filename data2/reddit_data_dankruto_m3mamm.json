The eight gates technique is more OP than a non-Uchiha with Sharingan\n\nI mean the dude fucked up a reanimated six paths Madara with his Eighth gate when Hashirama himself had a few days long battle with Madara without Rinnegan or Six-Paths mode.\n\nDoubt he would use all eight gates during a sparring match especially against his comrade, but he could probably open up enough gates to give enough speed and power to exhaust Kakashi enough that his chakra is depleted and his Sharingan out of the picture. That being said all Kakashi has to do is Izanagi after guy opened the last gate and he\u2019d be literal toast. I would assume Kakashi knows that technique   \n\nAlso depends on the sparring timeframe. It\u2019d be really cool to see how their power dynamic changed over the course of might unlocking gates and techniques and kakashi with all his crazy talent.",

That being said all Kakashi has to do is Izanagi after guy opened the last gate and he\u2019d be literal toast. I would assume Kakashi knows that technique   \n\nAlso depends on the sparring timeframe.
