    "body": "So I have been with my SD (66M) for a year now I\u2019m (24F) and yesterday he told me he doesn\u2019t want the arrangement anymore because he feels it not giving us a sense of a real relationship and feels fake. He also said he thinks I should get a job to support myself whilst studying and cut down on spending?? He\u2019s adamant on this and isn\u2019t going to give me my monthly allowance. He said he has to carry on working and so should I? Am I missing something here, I thought being with an older rich man comes with this benefit and had done for a year? Im just really confused. I do have feelings for him but I know nothing can ever be serious with us as the age gap is too much. Plus I\u2019m just trying to get through uni. What the hell do I say to him? I want to carry on seeing him but I also need the support financially",

If he parks his expensive car and  wanders into McDonalds and explains that the market has been brutal they are still going to want to be paid for the burger.",

Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",

That is base biology.  So after a year, he may simply have lost that initial excitement, and now it doesn't make any sense to him to pay you anything since he isn't that excited anymore and it was that sexual excitement that got him to pay in the first place.  But he still likes you and would still see you if you were willing, he just doesn't find it worth it to pay anymore when he could be paying that same amount but be getting someone new.  \n\nIt may also be that because he is no longer as excited by you, he just made the offer to keep seeing you to be polite or to make you be the one to break up with him, which does also allow you to save some face.  \n\nSo he may not actually be delusional, he may simply be done with the arrangement, and ready to be paying someone new.  That is the flip side of the sugar bowl. A SB will only be with the SD because he is paying, sure, but that willingness to pay (and pay well) means he can easily get another SB.  A SD who offers a very good amount will have good SBs lining up around the corner so he will have his pick - and that is a hard thing for a man to resist.  \n\nSo like with vanilla relationships, the basic rule of, when it's over, it's over, applies.  The SR is over.  It is up to you where you want to go from there.",

Or just don\u2019t bother and see it as a transactional relationship and just tell him the arrangement is over because he can\u2019t continue to provide the agreed upon arrangement",

Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",

That's no different, of course, of the traditional Ponzi scheme of giving investor's money to the original investors.

You picture a brioche bun with a perfectly cooked Angus beef patty maybe some bacon and melted Brie cheese with caramelised onions and some crisp lettuce and tomatoes. But no! Your friend brings you a Big Mac. \n\nThe friend is not wrong\u2026 a Big Mac IS a burger\u2026 but you just had different expectations. That\u2019s the feeling when you\u2019re looking for a genuine SR and encounter Johns posing as SDs \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and you spent all this time thinking, oh that burger is gonna be so nice and you\u2019re left wanting more when it arrives. \n\nAnd you can say \u201cgourmet\u201d or \u201cgenerous gentleman\u201d all you want you never know until you see the burger.

Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",

This also passes a general sniff test;  my 401k is down 17% year to date.  (from Jan 1st).\n\nBitcoin peaked at ~64k on November 12th/2021.  Today, just over 1 year later, it's sitting at 16,626.  That means it has lost 74% of it's value over the past year.\n\nIf you really think those two things are the same - I can only assume you are holding cyrpto and hoping some other suckers will come along to buy it / inflate the price up, so you can get back out of it and make your money.

The more you tone down the message to \"maybe\" and \"possibly\", the less effective it is.  \n\nIf your dad is worth 8 figures, regardless of his age, he does not have to work - unless somehow that money was all tied up in equity of a company that would be worthless if he were to retire.

Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",

The value of crypto is completely speculative, and regulatory bodies will eventually catch up even if it was previously theorized as the ultimate unregulateable currency. It was also theorized at its conception as the ultimate anti-inflation currency but I called BS on that since BitCoin was still in its roots.\n\nI believe just like any competitive industry eventually there will be a shakedown and international bodies will agree on one or a few being accepted and regulated, the rest will vaporize.

Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",

There was way too much froth in the market between retail investors and newbie/greedy/$$$-lusting financiers and with QE and government backing everything everything just became a hot mess while some people think its an investment dream come true (and many of them now have their wakeup calls)\n\nGrowth stocks will always have higher P/E than traditional stocks because that's their whole point, you expect the industry/business to grow. Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",

Traditional stocks issue dividends, but growth stocks get bid up, theoretically, for future earnings but we're graduating departing from that (which is too big a topic for a reddit comment)\n\n30-50x P/E is \"reasonable\" because of tech growth stocks and the digital age means rapidly replicating goods and services can happen at an instant with minimal variable input and increasing velocity of money  makes transactions equally fast. Whether or not 50-100x with the likes of prepandemic Amazon had other broader issues in the market is a much more complicated and bigger discussion, as people have been calling the market bubble since even before Trump was elected. (I blame ETFs, zombie markets, elimination of fees for retail stock trades ballooning the velocity of money within equity markets, etc. which is also too deep to get into)\n\nNone of the digital age phenomena and how productive value in goods and services delivered invalidates their intrinsic value.",
