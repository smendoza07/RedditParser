I feel I've been suggesting this a lot lately, but looking into curl gels which you scrunch out the crunchy cast after it's fully dry (it does not create flakes). Could even look into using a diffuser to dry your hair.",

I\u2019m very hands off with it and shampoo once or twice a week and rest of the times just conditioner or, less often, a simple and thorough wash with water. For drying my hair, I just grab it with my towel and hold it to let the water absorb in \u2014 nothing special. What do you think?",

For my curly hair I\u2019ve had success with adding a leave-in conditioner with another product for some hold and keeping curls together. Basically any hydrating leave-in conditioner should help, and for the other product I\u2019ve found a fiber cream really helps keep curls together. But YMMV! Especially with curly hair, what works for one person may not work for the next, since there is also so much diversity in coarseness and thickness. Godspeed on your hair product finding journey!",

Yes, I only use a blow dryer about twice a month or so and keep heat in general at a minimum, always applying Moroccan argan oil before I mess with it.

Basically any hydrating leave-in conditioner should help, and for the other product I\u2019ve found a fiber cream really helps keep curls together. But YMMV! Especially with curly hair, what works for one person may not work for the next, since there is also so much diversity in coarseness and thickness. Godspeed on your hair product finding journey!",
