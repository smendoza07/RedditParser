    "body": "My SB and I typically meet twice a month, which would be one weekend every two or three weeks. But in recent weeks we have met for three consecutive weekends and I love that we have been spending more time physically together.\n\nAfter having an early birthday celebration for me the weekend before, she asked for my help to drive her home to the suburbs yesterday so that she can visit her elderly mom. My SB, in her own words, is the 30 year old bum who doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license lol. So she took the offer I made before to drive her home whenever she needed to.\n\nYesterday was also our first platonic date ever (we did not have a platonic M&G \ud83d\ude0e) where we hung out and ordered lunch. I also lost a bet to her for the first time so the current score is 136261 to 1 and I\u2019m out five bucks \ud83d\ude44\n\nWe managed to have a short cuddle session before we made the drive and I don\u2019t know how she does it but cuddle sessions with her are simply the best.\n\nWe left during that golden sunset hour and took Lake Shore Drive which has the most picturesque views. Driving during sunset with this amazing beautiful woman next to me and listening to my current favorite songs is a small dream I\u2019ve always had and could finally live that dream.\n\nWhen we reached her home in the suburbs, I backed my car up in her driveway and stayed in my car, not wanting to cross any boundaries. As she unloaded her bags from the trunk into her garage, I saw in my side mirror her mom walking towards me.\n\nI rolled down my window, said Hi and her mom kept thanking me and told me how much it meant to her (that I drove her daughter home so they could spend time together). As I didn\u2019t expect to converse with her mom, I could only accept her thank you and wished that I could have personally told her what an amazing daughter she has.\n\nIt may not seem a lot to many but I really appreciate that my SB and I have built this level of trust in each other that she trusted me to drive her home safely, showed me her family home and even meet her mom.\n\nI\u2019ve told her before that the monthly allowance she gets is only for two dates a month and if there\u2019s any opportunity for us to meet more, her time will be compensated appropriately. Since we were meeting for the third time this month, I transferred her the PPM amount and she told me to take it back \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI insisted that she took it as a gift from me especially seeing how much she has trusted me at this stage. Thankfully she eventually accepted it and I told her not to fight me anymore on my gifts to her.\n\nIt\u2019s the little things she does that make me appreciate her so much more. What a wonderful feeling it is to be in a great SR. \u2764\ufe0f",
