    "body": "That POT SB who tells you that all her past arrangements have been strictly platonic with fine dining, gifts, international 5-star travel and monthly allowance of 10,000 included \n\nIs the equivalent of \n\nThat POT SD who tells you that all his past intimate arrangements were with gorgeous supermodels who didn\u2019t want money because they weren\u2019t mAteRiaListiC and were just looking for \u2018mentorship\u2019 and someone to take care of a phone bill or a tank of petrol now and then.\n\nGuess they\u2019re called \u2018unicorns\u2019 because they don\u2019t exist. \n\nJust a random thought reflecting on the sugar bowl.

All I got out of it was a KFC, a cinema trip to see How To Train Your Dragon2, and hours of unbearable conversation with someone who made it VERY clear why he had to pay someone to be his friend. \n\nSure, platonic is out there, but prepare to be disappointed.
