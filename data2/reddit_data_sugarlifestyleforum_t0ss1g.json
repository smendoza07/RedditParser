    "body": "Throwaway account, but I've lurked around on here literally for a couple years now intermittently. Even though I've never truly participated here, I feel indebted to this subreddit for the pure amount of advice (even though it wasn't directed to me). I would like to share my experience and the success story I've had. \n\nI'm 24F. I have an associates degree so it's not like I'm incredibly educated, and I have a fairly modest job in public safety/healthcare. I briefly escorted (just for extra cash & funsies) but quickly got burnt out on that. Did some onlyfans & camming, not really my jam either. I ended up getting onto a certain sugaring site. Although there was an expectation of obviously sugar dating being financially beneficial, but I wasn't particularly desperate. I'm not sure if this is in bad taste to say, but if anything I joined for the novelty of it - just for fun & for the risk. I did put a fair amount of work into my profile using the tips I've seen here though. His profile definitely didn't particularly stand out, was clearly legit and just looked like a decently paid techbro. \n\nWe did several platonic meet & greets. Vibe I got from the profile matched the vibe in person, buisness casual guy under 40 who drived a Tesla. Reasonably ccomplished, as sugar inexperienced as I was, nothing crazy in hindsight although crazy to me then. We ended up agreeing to an allowance and began seeing each other, we did a ton. Local fun dates, hiking, normal stuff.  \n\nWell boy, thankfully the dude wasn't a serial killer or something, because the vibe detector must have been miscalibrated as fuck. Turns out this dude is very high net worth level, absolutely a whale. Keep in mind, you're talking to the girl who grew up section 8 and thought just having a tesla was pretty whale status, but this is SLF whale status. Super beautiful house, security, fancy cars. I'm not sure if the initial presentation & allowance was a test or what, but it went up substantially at that point. It definitely freaked me out to some extent & got the insecurities churning because I didn't feel like I was worth that. \n\nI was wondering how long this could actually last, because it felt too crazy to be real and too good to be true. Spoiled to the umpteenth degree, actually treated amazingly, very sexually compatible & he's great in bed. Fast forward nearly 2 years later, things are still going great. Things transitioned from spoiled girlfriend to spoiled live-in fiance as we recently got engaged. I've gotten to go places, see things, and do shit I'd never thought I could. I'm so happy",

The real pleasure is in the connection, being consistent, anticipating her needs and providing.  The \u201csugar\u201d is chump change compared to bringing her into my lifestyle and raising her standards, financially and emotionally.  The sugar site though enabled us both to consider and meet someone we might not have met otherwise, and I\u2019m grateful for it.",
