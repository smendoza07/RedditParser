My first crush on a \u2018man\u2019 (not a teen heartthrob) was Aus swimmer Michael Klim. \n\nThe cut, as long as it\u2019s appropriate (I.e. no fucking combovers) makes a huge impact, so, even though it might seem weird, still go to the barber. Hairy necklines don\u2019t look good, and I don\u2019t imagine you\u2019ll be able to effectively get everything if you DIY. \n\nMy ex, who has been receding for the last 8 years, and a patch on the top at the back for the last 3 yrs (he\u2019s Caucasian with dirty blonde hair) still gets me to cut his hair, lamenting how he\u2019s just going to have to shave it soon. In the 9 years we were together, I convinced him to go to a barber ONCE (that\u2019s 1/approximately 216 haircuts). Barber didn\u2019t do a great job, but what he did do was cut away my ex\u2019s security hair. That was three years ago. We broke up 12 months ago, and I still cut his hair. \n\nEvery single cut he laments about his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll just shave it\u201d. Dude, no. You want to look like a hot bald guy by choice?

With that being said, I think many men can get away with a bald head because they have other physical attractive attributes that a woman would notice on a first impression, like nice facial features and good physique. You're not smiling so I can't tell what your teeth are like, but that's another plus. They don't need to be perfect by any means, just taken care of. So I'd say as an answer to your question, you are definitely one of the lucky bald guys that has this. :)",
