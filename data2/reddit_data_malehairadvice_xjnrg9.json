I usually shampoo, condition, untangle with a brush, rince hair, keep very wet hair then gel, head down and scrunch. I air dry, as I'm too lazy to use the hair dryer. If you do, use a diffuser.\n\nI feel like the oil is doing you a disservice, I would ditch it and use a gel (or mousse, if it suits you) It's okay to use it once in a while to make a mask, but everyday is maybe too much. Look at no sulfate shampoo and no silicone conditioner, if you feel like it mess your hair. Sulfate clears silicone, if you use a no sulfate shampoo with a silicone conditioner it's a bad idea. No sulfate will aggress your hair less, curly hairs are fragile.",

It looks greasy so you\u2019re either not washing it good enough or the product you\u2019re using isn\u2019t good for your hair.  Don\u2019t start over washing it, a lot of guys over wash their hair, you should only be washing it like every four or five days (you will go through a period of your hair feeling more greasy during these times but that\u2019s because your head is used to producing more oil to compensate for how often you\u2019re washing it and it\u2019ll look good after a week). I would recommend some wave cr\u00e8me to put in after you shower. \n\nIf you want a different style, I would cut all but like three inches off and that\u2019ll leave you a lot of room to style it and mess with it as you want, but hair styles work differently with face shapes and by not being able to see what your face shape is, it\u2019s not easy to actually recommend a different hair style",

I usually shampoo, condition, untangle with a brush, rince hair, keep very wet hair then gel, head down and scrunch. I air dry, as I'm too lazy to use the hair dryer. If you do, use a diffuser.\n\nI feel like the oil is doing you a disservice, I would ditch it and use a gel (or mousse, if it suits you) It's okay to use it once in a while to make a mask, but everyday is maybe too much. Look at no sulfate shampoo and no silicone conditioner, if you feel like it mess your hair. Sulfate clears silicone, if you use a no sulfate shampoo with a silicone conditioner it's a bad idea. No sulfate will aggress your hair less, curly hairs are fragile.",
