No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",

No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",

No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",

No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",

No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",

No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",

No thanks, I\u2019d rather enjoy the viewing experience completely and let my ears do their job of listening. \nAnd thirdly, I can\u2019t stand engrish. \n\nThat being said, I would never watch a real life movie like parasite in dub because there we see real people acting and dub would just break the immersion and experience, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me in anime because they\u2019re just 2D characters. \n\nThere are certain characters where I feel the English VAs aren\u2019t casted as well as the Japanese ones in terms of their voice like Gabi and Hanji from AOT, but since this is a naruto sub I have to say that naruto\u2019s English casting(in terms of voices matching characters) is as close to perfect as it gets.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take anything away from the Japanese versions, they\u2019re good in their own right but all I\u2019m saying is that there is no incentive for me to put the effort in to read subs and miss out on many of the visual elements.",
