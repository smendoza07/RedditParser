Kakashi, Itachi and Gai are the exception to the rule as they are much, much stronger than the average Jonin. In the Narutoverse, ninjas like Zabuza are considered super-strong monsters and ANBU-level ninjas when, to the audience, they are the equivalent of the farmer with the shotgun in DBZ  \n\n\nSo when a Kage-level ninja like Itachi encounters an average Jonin like Kurenai, the result could not have been different. It's like Raditz facing the farmer with the shotgun. Even the all-mighty Kakashi, considered the strongest Jonin in the village below the Hokage, was one-shotted by Itachi. She isn't weak by normal standarts, but she is pathetic by the \"genious\" standart that Itachi and Kakashi are part off.",

In the Narutoverse, ninjas like Zabuza are considered super-strong monsters and ANBU-level ninjas when, to the audience, they are the equivalent of the farmer with the shotgun in DBZ  \n\n\nSo when a Kage-level ninja like Itachi encounters an average Jonin like Kurenai, the result could not have been different. It's like Raditz facing the farmer with the shotgun. Even the all-mighty Kakashi, considered the strongest Jonin in the village below the Hokage, was one-shotted by Itachi. She isn't weak by normal standarts, but she is pathetic by the \"genious\" standart that Itachi and Kakashi are part off.",

If we put aside her brute strength and regeneration, we can see that she's horrible in just about every other ninja art (Genjutsu, Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, Kenjutsu)\n\nKakashi, Lee, Neji, Darui or even Choji would eat her for lunch. But she is indeed the strongest woman in Konoha, because Tsunade is super old now, but on her prime, Sakura have no chance against her master.\n\nIf Hinata still have access to her Hamura's chakra, she is stronger than Sakura, but since its still unclear, Sakura stays as the top woman on Konoha.",
