    "body": "I really just want people to appreciate Somin more and not hate her for being the show's \"focus.\" She's literally just doing her best to be funny and she's actually naturally cute and funny, that's why she gets lots of screen time. I've been watching Running Man since 2012 and when she joined, I never felt anything negative towards her. I love how she can be pretty, cute, funny and crazy at the same time. She never holds back to avoid being embarrassing. She's crazy but in a fun way and I really believe she deserves all the good things. I don't get why people hate her, it must be because of their insecurities. Anyway, whoever is reading this, please protect Jeon Somin at all costs. Leave positive comments on her IG posts and give her lots of appreciation and love! As well as the other members, but I really just have a soft spot for Somin, I feel like she's so pure and she doesn't deserve the hate she's receiving ever since she joined.",

The people who hate on her dont understand it cause theyre mindset is still in the early 2010s when winnig was all that mattered on the show.\n\nNow they see in their minds an inferior in every way girl do better than the ideal female in SJH in terms of air time and their peanut brains cant comprehend it.\n\nThey shit on her and believe she sleeps around with the PDs cause apparently they have no sense of humor or personality cause theyre blind to why everyone loves Somin",

Obviously the original cast is tired and frankly their age is catching up to them. They cant always bring you the hardknock comedy that we all love and adore!\n\nShe and also Sechan is a wonderful addition to the show and brings in new flavour but with the same recipe. You dont like it, then stop watching. Watching and complaining wont change anything. Throwing negative comments and attacking her wont CHANGE A THING. The only thing that will change is a person's life. OBVIOUSLY yall will feel remorse and regret ONLY after \"bad things\" happen. YOU dont have to go there. No one will gain anything. NOT the show, NOT the cast, NOT the fans.\n\nSo either shut the hell up and stop watching or give her a chance. SHE will grown onto you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJEON SOMIN FTW",

It\u2019s also diversified now with Somin\u2019s craziness. It allows for every team to have an opportunity to always be teamed with a crazy one.\n\nLove Frog: With Lee Kwang Soo being in a relationship, he definitely has taken a back seat for the one initiating love lines. It has also gotten dry since most female guest don\u2019t respond as much. But with Somin fervently chasing men, there becomes a new life for the character.\n\nLetting SJH be SJH:  With the majority of cast being males, it is assumed that when there is a male guest it will ALWAYS be partnered for Jihyo. But with Somin\u2019s addition, JiHyo can be simply partnered with Haha or JSJ which probably allows her more screen time anyways.\n\n\nBut y\u2019all get the idea.\n\nNo Somin No Life.\n\n\nTL;DR Somin\u2019s addition to the runningman has more pros than cons.",

Somin acts all shy and cute and flirty around male guests and that can be triggering to some, but then that's not fair because when the guys act a certain way with the female guests they don't get hate for that. She's trying her best to be equal to the males on the show and people should give her more respect for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish there was a way to show her this thread and let her know that there are smarter people out there who appreciate her and want to see her continue on the show.",

And I know them well enough, to say that they really appreciate her efforts and expect a lot more from her.\n\nPeople with taste and a brain, had already figured it out, others started groups where they brainwash those who cannot think for themselves, lack a proper vision of their own life, into thinking that she is a \"the villain\" in all of this. \n\nSo unless you want to do the same, I recomand to not fight or try to convince them... it's vain, and you will waste your precious time.

I believe SM antis also consider themselves as a protection squad in their twisted way. But I don't think that is what the OP intended since you are talking about leaving positive comments.\n\nUnlike some section of the RM fandom, I don't believe SM saved RM. That is discrediting the work of all the RM members and the PDs, in particular, Chul Min PD who came up with great ideas that made RM trendy again. But Chul Min PD wasn't so great at planned missions and would often leave it up to the members to create content. SM was able to blend in and create great content on her own that made RM exciting and fun to watch. More importantly, she was the breath of fresh air RM needed.\n\nI have a thing against stan culture and personality cults, especially around RM members. The hate on JSM is largely a result of insecurities of some SJH fans who have built a personality cult around her and consider her the best RM member.  They don't get it that being an entertainer is a job and a job you have to get better at like all jobs. For them, being an entertainer and star are one and the same. By this logic, their bias has to get everything, screen time, members' attention and male guests who fawn over her. JSM being a fellow female member and the latest addition to the team has been getting the brunt of it over the last three years, but truth to tell, it has always existed in some way or other even before. Female guests on RM used to be the recipients from time to time and any member who playfully hit or punched JH used to get it and so did the PDs who got accused of editing JH out with malicious intent. JSM came around with better talking skills and fewer inhibitions and she became the convenient target for all of JH's problems. That is how this cycle started.",

Shouldn't some of the haters stop their campaigns seeing her improvement? But that is not the point for them. They think eliminating competition will make SJH shine better when that is not the way the variety scene works at all. There is so much for them to learn from each other and from others.\n\nWith all the hate propaganda, the two girls will never become as close as they could have been. JSM is weak at physical games and could have learnt from SJH how to fight back and strategize . SJH could have finally learnt from JSM to shed her inhibitions and make her  screen time. Instead of being someone who has to be carried in variety, she could have become someone capable of carrying a show. Outside the show, JH could have become a cool unnie for So Min who would teach her how to manage her health and longevity and not be the indirect cause of So Min's suffering. Sadly, these fans never think of what JH could have gained, only what she has lost, but that is something she would have lost anyway. \n\nI don't believe in raising one to put another down. What is happening with a section of JH fans can happen with a section of SM fans in the future if she joins a new show and someone better than her comes along. I hope that doesn't happen. So Min is definitely talented, but she will have to get a lot better with all the competition among female entertainers. There are so many stand out entertainers like Park Na Rae and Jang Da Yeon who have made it on their own. But many people think she can grow into a great entertainer with the right shows, PDs and mentors.\n\nFor JH to become better as an entertainer, she will have to change her attitude towards variety, let go more and be more willing to engage with others. But that will need a lot more effort on her part and doesn't have much to do with So Min, her colleagues or PDs That is what SM's antis never ever get.",

Her fans generally appreciate her with other women. It would be interesting to see how the fandom behaves with the new tvn show where there are other female entertainers along with So Min and  inevitable comparisons will spring up.  As long as she performs like she has been doing, there won't arise a situation where fans have to defend her by bashing someone else. If she can also establish a good rapport with the women in the cast and put it out for fans to see and root for, stan far wars involving her will be minimal. Public acknowledgements of sismances in variety shows have always helped the fans stay within lines.\n\nKS had a lot of trouble with viewers accepting him in a serious role, but he has been finally acknowledged.

I first started watching when they were around episode 80-something, immediately got a hold of all the older episodes, and have been watching weekly since. \nMy favourite member has always been Song Ji Hyo, but I love all the members. She is usually quiet and doesn't get a lot of screen time, but I think that Ji Hyo really shines when she has a spy mission, she is really great at fooling the others imo. I also like hearing about and seeing the moments where she is taking care of the others and the guests. She just sounds like a caring, but quiet person (at least on RM). \n\nI do not understand why people hate on Jeon So Min so much. When So Min started, I did find her a bit annoying, but I certainly don't and have never hated her or hated on her. She has grown on me, and I do enjoy her a lot more. \n\nI do wonder if the level of protectiveness they feel for Ji Hyo comes from a specific incident in the past where she and Kim Jong Kook were almost fired. Then, with no other female coming close to being a regular (other than Lizzy, and that didn't last long) with another female coming into play they instead see her as a threat to Ji Hyo's position on the show. Not that it excuses the current behaviour.",

I call them giving always their 100% no matter their condition, nor role on that day.\nOne is willing to run till north Korea on mud, breaking all rules and stealing the spotlight from 4 of the best guests RM has even known.\n\n2nd, there never been a quota that says, more screen time for one member mean less for another. They edit out what's useless and not funny, because the general public is merciless, they are not fans who just enjoy the routine of watching the members... You need to keep them on the channel, so no dull moment, or it's over!! We saw many times when an episode finish until the next week, that's just how good the footage was, it would be a waste to edit any of it. Which Btw didn't happen for a long time now... That should send you a clear message.\n\nThe Pd team is struggling, between giving in to the fans and loosing the general public, or try to appeal again to the masses and face the wrath of \"some\" fans.\nYou can clearly see what they choosed, and what's the result....",

Pretty sure the low screen time members do not watch the show at all, either too busy or don't care to review their performance to improve. There's many posts on Reddit before JSM & YSC joined that discuss SJH's lack of screen time & why, even before Gary left, back then PDs weren't blamed for being bias toward the male members who earned more screen time than SJH. At the end of the day, RM is a job, like any job performance depends on the person who has that job, being active means screen time, ep513 you see SJH earn screen time because she took initiative in choosing JSJ who in turn would create good chemistry for her to work with where Angry Jihyo returned, SJH was acting playful which is rare, like pranking SoYu, something that JSM said she would've done to MiJoo if they were close. If SJH is happier without JSM being present, maybe because she was trying to fill the gap JSM left, why would SJH be the one who contacted JSM the most asking when she'd return, there's got to be a burden to SJH being the only girl member for years, JSM lifted that burden from SJH. The reason why new members JSM & YSC joined the show is because of their personalities & presence, you need that for a show that's been on many years which naturally can get stale, they in turn help the members reinvent their characters too.",

Somin is just doing her job, a job SJH is supposed to be good at as she has been on the show for 10 years but STILL struggles to find a role on the show.\n\n>to the point that other casts don't get enough screentime. \n\nI'm sorry what? I don't understand this. Most of the time when Somin makes a scene, it creates an opportunity for the other members to feed on.  Witty members like LKS, YJS, or JSJ wait for these moments to attacks her with snarky comments which results in more screen time for them as well. SJH gets little to no screen time because she is not as witty and spontaneous as the members so she relies on others to create a scene for her. (i.e YSC or JSJ). But unfortunately, as YJS mentioned before \"Sometimes Jihyo's answer is so bad, we can't even air them on the show.\"\n\n>You guys can see the effect of her overwhelming presence when she temporarily stopped filming due to her health.  \n\nYou can also see the effect before Somin and YSC joined the show when it was on the brink of getting canceled. But thank god to KJK, the show is still here to stay and its also thanks to the new members as well. They reignited the flame the show lost. I love Somin's energy and I love Sechan's awkwardness. IMO, it safe to say they saved the show. Btw, ratings don't matter, nobody watches tv that much nowadays.\n\nSo yeah, I love SJH but ever since Gary left and she lost her Monday couple role, she has only been in the background with only little memorable scenes. People need to stop kissing SJH's ass and blaming the other members for her lack of presence on the show. Instead, SJH needs to pull her own weight and not rely on others to get screentime if she wants to stay relevant on the show.",

She's always been like this because she had Gary to rely on, so she felt confortable in just acting as a Monday Girlfriend, but then, Gary left and she lost this presence she had, even on episodes where the Monday Couple \"broke up\" she almost never have any screen time, althought, in the past, she would talk a lot more than nowadays.\n\nShe is obviously struggling to find a way to be active again, and I think she's fouding it since the new PD joined the show, you can see she's becomming a lot brighter and it has NOTHING to do with Somin being out of the show... When Somin took a break, Jihyo was already getting back to her old self and when Somin was \"gone\" she had to fill the void for her so she overdid it.\n\nWhen Somin got back to the show, both girls showed viewers how much they missed each other, and I think some toxic fans should appreciate this scene more and be proud of Jihyo for starting to work a little bit harder nowadays. I know she's an introvert and has said several times that she doesn't know how to take the iniciative, and I as an introvert know too how hard it is to finally be the one to start talking or joking around EVEN with friends I've known for years. Somin has 0 fault for her lack of screen time, the only one to be blamed is Jihyo herself and it really hurts me to say this, but I don't think it's a bad thing to say the truth.\n\nAlso, I am 100% sure the new PD talked to her about this, because the change is so noticible since the new PD joined that it's the only explanation, and I think these so called Jihyo fans should be praising her for it and not attacking Somin. As I said before, If people don't stop attacking Somin EVEN WHEN Jihyo is CLEARLY IMPROVING, it's the same thing as saying all the hardwork Jihyo is doing is useless",

It\u2019s the reason why they act as if the other members stopped caring about Jihyo and mistreat her in favour of Somin.\n\nIf Somin was a man and behaved the exact same way they wouldn\u2019t be complaining this much. I mean look at all the hate she gets from flirting with male guests as part of her character. As if 3 different members didn\u2019t used to do that regularly. This has nothing to do with the same old lie that Somin is greedy for screentime and everything to do with specific fans not understanding that two women can exist on one show and have their own merits and/or strengths that earn them screentime.",

Shouldn't some of the haters stop their campaigns seeing her improvement? But that is not the point for them. They think eliminating competition will make SJH shine better when that is not the way the variety scene works at all. There is so much for them to learn from each other and from others.\n\nWith all the hate propaganda, the two girls will never become as close as they could have been. JSM is weak at physical games and could have learnt from SJH how to fight back and strategize . SJH could have finally learnt from JSM to shed her inhibitions and make her  screen time. Instead of being someone who has to be carried in variety, she could have become someone capable of carrying a show. Outside the show, JH could have become a cool unnie for So Min who would teach her how to manage her health and longevity and not be the indirect cause of So Min's suffering. Sadly, these fans never think of what JH could have gained, only what she has lost, but that is something she would have lost anyway. \n\nI don't believe in raising one to put another down. What is happening with a section of JH fans can happen with a section of SM fans in the future if she joins a new show and someone better than her comes along. I hope that doesn't happen. So Min is definitely talented, but she will have to get a lot better with all the competition among female entertainers. There are so many stand out entertainers like Park Na Rae and Jang Da Yeon who have made it on their own. But many people think she can grow into a great entertainer with the right shows, PDs and mentors.\n\nFor JH to become better as an entertainer, she will have to change her attitude towards variety, let go more and be more willing to engage with others. But that will need a lot more effort on her part and doesn't have much to do with So Min, her colleagues or PDs That is what SM's antis never ever get.",

It would be interesting to see how the fandom behaves with the new tvn show where there are other female entertainers along with So Min and  inevitable comparisons will spring up.  As long as she performs like she has been doing, there won't arise a situation where fans have to defend her by bashing someone else. If she can also establish a good rapport with the women in the cast and put it out for fans to see and root for, stan far wars involving her will be minimal.

I call them giving always their 100% no matter their condition, nor role on that day.\nOne is willing to run till north Korea on mud, breaking all rules and stealing the spotlight from 4 of the best guests RM has even known.\n\n2nd, there never been a quota that says, more screen time for one member mean less for another. They edit out what's useless and not funny, because the general public is merciless, they are not fans who just enjoy the routine of watching the members... You need to keep them on the channel, so no dull moment, or it's over!! We saw many times when an episode finish until the next week, that's just how good the footage was, it would be a waste to edit any of it. Which Btw didn't happen for a long time now... That should send you a clear message.\n\nThe Pd team is struggling, between giving in to the fans and loosing the general public, or try to appeal again to the masses and face the wrath of \"some\" fans.\nYou can clearly see what they choosed, and what's the result....",

Pretty sure the low screen time members do not watch the show at all, either too busy or don't care to review their performance to improve. There's many posts on Reddit before JSM & YSC joined that discuss SJH's lack of screen time & why, even before Gary left, back then PDs weren't blamed for being bias toward the male members who earned more screen time than SJH. At the end of the day, RM is a job, like any job performance depends on the person who has that job, being active means screen time, ep513 you see SJH earn screen time because she took initiative in choosing JSJ who in turn would create good chemistry for her to work with where Angry Jihyo returned, SJH was acting playful which is rare, like pranking SoYu, something that JSM said she would've done to MiJoo if they were close. If SJH is happier without JSM being present, maybe because she was trying to fill the gap JSM left, why would SJH be the one who contacted JSM the most asking when she'd return, there's got to be a burden to SJH being the only girl member for years, JSM lifted that burden from SJH. The reason why new members JSM & YSC joined the show is because of their personalities & presence, you need that for a show that's been on many years which naturally can get stale, they in turn help the members reinvent their characters too.",

The members make a lot of funny scenes, the editors and directors pick and choose what to put on the show. Somin is just doing her job, a job SJH is supposed to be good at as she has been on the show for 10 years but STILL struggles to find a role on the show.\n\n>to the point that other casts don't get enough screentime. \n\nI'm sorry what? I don't understand this. Most of the time when Somin makes a scene, it creates an opportunity for the other members to feed on.  Witty members like LKS, YJS, or JSJ wait for these moments to attacks her with snarky comments which results in more screen time for them as well. SJH gets little to no screen time because she is not as witty and spontaneous as the members so she relies on others to create a scene for her. (i.e YSC or JSJ). But unfortunately, as YJS mentioned before \"Sometimes Jihyo's answer is so bad, we can't even air them on the show.\"\n\n>You guys can see the effect of her overwhelming presence when she temporarily stopped filming due to her health.  \n\nYou can also see the effect before Somin and YSC joined the show when it was on the brink of getting canceled. But thank god to KJK, the show is still here to stay and its also thanks to the new members as well. They reignited the flame the show lost. I love Somin's energy and I love Sechan's awkwardness. IMO, it safe to say they saved the show. Btw, ratings don't matter, nobody watches tv that much nowadays.\n\nSo yeah, I love SJH but ever since Gary left and she lost her Monday couple role, she has only been in the background with only little memorable scenes. People need to stop kissing SJH's ass and blaming the other members for her lack of presence on the show. Instead, SJH needs to pull her own weight and not rely on others to get screentime if she wants to stay relevant on the show.",

I stan people who work their asses off and even defy situations that try to drag them down. For that, I stan all of the members since day 1. Now, sjh fell behind. It would be okay to see her trying even if she fails because everyone always gives her the stage when she suddenly want to say something but she's gotten so comfortable it doesn't feel like she's working anymore.

I'll always say this, I was really disappointed w her because she's my favorite...But seeing how hard she's working now, taking more iniciative, talking more and getting back to \"Angry Jihyo\" \"Mong Jihyo\" and all that stuff makes me proud of her.\n\nThis doesn't mean she didn't have a bad era, she relies too much on the members since forever, you can see it on couple races because the pair w Jihyo almost never gets any screen time, sometimes they even skipped them 'till the last game. She's always been like this because she had Gary to rely on, so she felt confortable in just acting as a Monday Girlfriend, but then, Gary left and she lost this presence she had, even on episodes where the Monday Couple \"broke up\" she almost never have any screen time, althought, in the past, she would talk a lot more than nowadays.\n\nShe is obviously struggling to find a way to be active again, and I think she's fouding it since the new PD joined the show, you can see she's becomming a lot brighter and it has NOTHING to do with Somin being out of the show... When Somin took a break, Jihyo was already getting back to her old self and when Somin was \"gone\" she had to fill the void for her so she overdid it.\n\nWhen Somin got back to the show, both girls showed viewers how much they missed each other, and I think some toxic fans should appreciate this scene more and be proud of Jihyo for starting to work a little bit harder nowadays. I know she's an introvert and has said several times that she doesn't know how to take the iniciative, and I as an introvert know too how hard it is to finally be the one to start talking or joking around EVEN with friends I've known for years. Somin has 0 fault for her lack of screen time, the only one to be blamed is Jihyo herself and it really hurts me to say this, but I don't think it's a bad thing to say the truth.\n\nAlso, I am 100% sure the new PD talked to her about this, because the change is so noticible since the new PD joined that it's the only explanation, and I think these so called Jihyo fans should be praising her for it and not attacking Somin. As I said before, If people don't stop attacking Somin EVEN WHEN Jihyo is CLEARLY IMPROVING, it's the same thing as saying all the hardwork Jihyo is doing is useless",

They loved the idea of Jihyo not only being the main woman on the show but also her being considered \u201cone of the boys\u201d. Seeing Somin get treated positively by them in the same way they treat Jihyo without her doing any of what she did is an issue for them. \n\nI dunno whether it\u2019s because they vicariously live through Jihyo or because they\u2019re still clinging onto the ace character and inaccurately believe it\u2019s all she has to offer. Either way its the reason why they love the idea of the members secretly hating Somin and when the members prove otherwise they start attacking them. It\u2019s the reason why they act as if the other members stopped caring about Jihyo and mistreat her in favour of Somin.\n\nIf Somin was a man and behaved the exact same way they wouldn\u2019t be complaining this much.

I stan people who work their asses off and even defy situations that try to drag them down. For that, I stan all of the members since day 1. Now, sjh fell behind.

I'll always say this, I was really disappointed w her because she's my favorite...But seeing how hard she's working now, taking more iniciative, talking more and getting back to \"Angry Jihyo\" \"Mong Jihyo\" and all that stuff makes me proud of her.\n\nThis doesn't mean she didn't have a bad era, she relies too much on the members since forever, you can see it on couple races because the pair w Jihyo almost never gets any screen time, sometimes they even skipped them 'till the last game. She's always been like this because she had Gary to rely on, so she felt confortable in just acting as a Monday Girlfriend, but then, Gary left and she lost this presence she had, even on episodes where the Monday Couple \"broke up\" she almost never have any screen time, althought, in the past, she would talk a lot more than nowadays.\n\nShe is obviously struggling to find a way to be active again, and I think she's fouding it since the new PD joined the show, you can see she's becomming a lot brighter and it has NOTHING to do with Somin being out of the show... When Somin took a break, Jihyo was already getting back to her old self and when Somin was \"gone\" she had to fill the void for her so she overdid it.\n\nWhen Somin got back to the show, both girls showed viewers how much they missed each other, and I think some toxic fans should appreciate this scene more and be proud of Jihyo for starting to work a little bit harder nowadays. I know she's an introvert and has said several times that she doesn't know how to take the iniciative, and I as an introvert know too how hard it is to finally be the one to start talking or joking around EVEN with friends I've known for years. Somin has 0 fault for her lack of screen time, the only one to be blamed is Jihyo herself and it really hurts me to say this, but I don't think it's a bad thing to say the truth.\n\nAlso, I am 100% sure the new PD talked to her about this, because the change is so noticible since the new PD joined that it's the only explanation, and I think these so called Jihyo fans should be praising her for it and not attacking Somin. As I said before, If people don't stop attacking Somin EVEN WHEN Jihyo is CLEARLY IMPROVING, it's the same thing as saying all the hardwork Jihyo is doing is useless",

            "body": "Well, to be fair, Jihyo is working hard nowadays. I'll always say this, I was really disappointed w her because she's my favorite...But seeing how hard she's working now, taking more iniciative, talking more and getting back to \"Angry Jihyo\" \"Mong Jihyo\" and all that stuff makes me proud of her.\n\nThis doesn't mean she didn't have a bad era, she relies too much on the members since forever, you can see it on couple races because the pair w Jihyo almost never gets any screen time, sometimes they even skipped them 'till the last game. She's always been like this because she had Gary to rely on, so she felt confortable in just acting as a Monday Girlfriend, but then, Gary left and she lost this presence she had, even on episodes where the Monday Couple \"broke up\" she almost never have any screen time, althought, in the past, she would talk a lot more than nowadays.\n\nShe is obviously struggling to find a way to be active again, and I think she's fouding it since the new PD joined the show, you can see she's becomming a lot brighter and it has NOTHING to do with Somin being out of the show... When Somin took a break, Jihyo was already getting back to her old self and when Somin was \"gone\" she had to fill the void for her so she overdid it.\n\nWhen Somin got back to the show, both girls showed viewers how much they missed each other, and I think some toxic fans should appreciate this scene more and be proud of Jihyo for starting to work a little bit harder nowadays. I know she's an introvert and has said several times that she doesn't know how to take the iniciative, and I as an introvert know too how hard it is to finally be the one to start talking or joking around EVEN with friends I've known for years. Somin has 0 fault for her lack of screen time, the only one to be blamed is Jihyo herself and it really hurts me to say this, but I don't think it's a bad thing to say the truth.\n\nAlso, I am 100% sure the new PD talked to her about this, because the change is so noticible since the new PD joined that it's the only explanation, and I think these so called Jihyo fans should be praising her for it and not attacking Somin. As I said before, If people don't stop attacking Somin EVEN WHEN Jihyo is CLEARLY IMPROVING, it's the same thing as saying all the hardwork Jihyo is doing is useless",

This is only a thought and could easily be solved in the coming RM ep. I have only seen her in RM, some eps of unpretty rapstar, and her interview program. I don't know if it is the character she plays, but she is mostly this celeb who doesn't abide by the 'laws of variety' and comedy ensues from people like YJS and KS rein her in. I find her entertaining but just really curious about this pair. Ah, it doesn't help that *I have no* idea what kind of program this is.",

It\u2019s interesting because both are outlandish and tend to have no filter but in completely different ways.
