No one is saying you can\u2019t have your own opinion, just be aware if you\u2019re speaking from a position of ignorance you will be called out on it. Se Chan has been cast in more than 20 variety shows in the last 5 years and is a permanent cast member in 6 shows - I get it there\u2019s something about them that irritates you, but seriously bro you can\u2019t negate the fact that they both are successful and popular just because you personally don\u2019t like them.",

I mean the fact that he\u2019s been booked on award winning shows and made permanent in a lot must surely infer that he\u2019s a quality celebrity? Regardless of how you deny the reality he\u2019s a very popular comedian who has work. If you dont believe he\u2019s good that\u2019s your opinion and you are most welcome to it but the facts are that he\u2019s popular and getting more work due to his popularity. And you are calling Kwang Soo a comedian as well as calling Haha a comedian? I feel this circular discussion is pointless if you\u2019re comparing a comedian who can get a lot of Tv work due to his popularity to an award winning actor who\u2019s selective on his roles and a singer/record producer.

No one is saying you can\u2019t have your own opinion, just be aware if you\u2019re speaking from a position of ignorance you will be called out on it. Se Chan has been cast in more than 20 variety shows in the last 5 years and is a permanent cast member in 6 shows - I get it there\u2019s something about them that irritates you, but seriously bro you can\u2019t negate the fact that they both are successful and popular just because you personally don\u2019t like them.",

I mean the fact that he\u2019s been booked on award winning shows and made permanent in a lot must surely infer that he\u2019s a quality celebrity? Regardless of how you deny the reality he\u2019s a very popular comedian who has work. If you dont believe he\u2019s good that\u2019s your opinion and you are most welcome to it but the facts are that he\u2019s popular and getting more work due to his popularity.

I mean the fact that he\u2019s been booked on award winning shows and made permanent in a lot must surely infer that he\u2019s a quality celebrity? Regardless of how you deny the reality he\u2019s a very popular comedian who has work. If you dont believe he\u2019s good that\u2019s your opinion and you are most welcome to it but the facts are that he\u2019s popular and getting more work due to his popularity. And you are calling Kwang Soo a comedian as well as calling Haha a comedian?

He doesn\u2019t irritate and you and you do like him? I mean the fact that he\u2019s been booked on award winning shows and made permanent in a lot must surely infer that he\u2019s a quality celebrity? Regardless of how you deny the reality he\u2019s a very popular comedian who has work. If you dont believe he\u2019s good that\u2019s your opinion and you are most welcome to it but the facts are that he\u2019s popular and getting more work due to his popularity. And you are calling Kwang Soo a comedian as well as calling Haha a comedian? I feel this circular discussion is pointless if you\u2019re comparing a comedian who can get a lot of Tv work due to his popularity to an award winning actor who\u2019s selective on his roles and a singer/record producer.

Song Ji Hyo and Haha are not a comedians, Kwang Soo is not a comedian. The OP is about Yang Se Chan, you made it personal (which by the way doesn\u2019t bother me) but that\u2019s why you got the DVs the reality is that he is more popular than you\u2019d care to admit and now you\u2019re just being salty. No one is saying you can\u2019t have your own opinion, just be aware if you\u2019re speaking from a position of ignorance you will be called out on it. Se Chan has been cast in more than 20 variety shows in the last 5 years and is a permanent cast member in 6 shows - I get it there\u2019s something about them that irritates you, but seriously bro you can\u2019t negate the fact that they both are successful and popular just because you personally don\u2019t like them.",
