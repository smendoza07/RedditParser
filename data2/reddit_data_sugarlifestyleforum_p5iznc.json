    "body": "I took my SB to one of those \"paint and sip\" things.  I am not good at painting, but I am excellent at sipping wine, so I thought it would be okay.  This was definitely not my idea though; I am just highly susceptible to peer pressure.\n#\nWe get to the art studio, and I turn out to be the only guy there.  Uh oh.  This is going to go badly; like that time I took a girl on a date to a Lamaze class.  I thought a room full of women heavy breathing would be sexy.  However, I am man enough to admit when I am slightly less than right.\n#\nI am standing there nervously wondering when they will open the wine, when the instructor walks in.  A very handsome man that I would describe as \"Spanish Ryan Reynolds that spends all day lifting weights and saving kittens from trees.\"  My SB is staring at this dude the same way that I stare at her, and let me tell you.... kinda creepy yo.  It's very clear who she is going to be thinking about when she fakes an orgasm with me later.\n#\nAs we start to paint,  I can't help but wonder what kind of tragic accident happened to this man on his way to work, that caused all of the buttons on his shirt above the navel, to stop working.  Like every paint stroke was a 30% chance of seeing a nipple.  I slam a few glasses of merlot.  No one appears to be impressed.  My exceptional drinking skills are totally being upstaged by some shaved pecs.\n#\nSo then he tells us to use some \"teal.\"  Ladies, allow me to be honest with you.  There are only like 8 colors.  Everything else was invented by toy companies to sell crayons.  I figure \"teal\" rhymes with seal, so it must be some sort of grey?  But I don't have any grey paint, so I ask my SB.  She never looks away from sexy Bob Ross, and tells me it's \"across from the \"fuchsia.\"  My dudes, until last week, I thought fuchsia was a type of pasta.\n#\nNow look, I am not criticizing my SB for being utterly unhelpful.  If I took a SB to a strip club, and she brought a coloring book... Well, girl is on her own when it comes to staying in the lines.  So I kind of went my own direction with my painting. I know my girl really likes Victoria Secret, so I used a lot of light red in my painting.  She later called it:  \"Off-brand Georgia O'Keeffe.\"  I don't think I was hiding subtle vaginas in anything, but there was one time in school when my geometry teacher told me I drew the sexiest rhombus ever.  That might have been what she was seeing.",
