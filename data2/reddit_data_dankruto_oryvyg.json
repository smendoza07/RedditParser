They\u2019re done.\n\nA skyscraper or more tall Susanoo with those abilities like shit, wish we could see it just once, somewhere. Like Kakashi\u2019s dad, and more missing exciting things\u2026\n\nWas gonna say, so Itachi's Susanoo would be the **only** one with straight melee, so I can only imagine how his Susanoo would fight, it'd be intense. Low budget episode - slow swords clashing and whatever he's against I imagine sword and sword contact, pushing against each other, slow low-animated battle...\n\nHigh budget episode - We get something kinda like Naruto/Sasuke's Susanoo VS. Momoshiki intense, \"poorly\" animated maybe like Pain vs. Naruto **but** Itachi's Susanoo going ham, like absolutely bouncing around the screen, doing all sorts of melee moves, and deflections.",

He'd have to finish the fight really quick before his part 1 self ran out of chakra if he wanted to win",

They\u2019re done.\n\nA skyscraper or more tall Susanoo with those abilities like shit, wish we could see it just once, somewhere. Like Kakashi\u2019s dad, and more missing exciting things\u2026\n\nWas gonna say, so Itachi's Susanoo would be the **only** one with straight melee, so I can only imagine how his Susanoo would fight, it'd be intense. Low budget episode - slow swords clashing and whatever he's against I imagine sword and sword contact, pushing against each other, slow low-animated battle...\n\nHigh budget episode - We get something kinda like Naruto/Sasuke's Susanoo VS. Momoshiki intense, \"poorly\" animated maybe like Pain vs. Naruto **but** Itachi's Susanoo going ham, like absolutely bouncing around the screen, doing all sorts of melee moves, and deflections.",

They\u2019re done.\n\nA skyscraper or more tall Susanoo with those abilities like shit, wish we could see it just once, somewhere. Like Kakashi\u2019s dad, and more missing exciting things\u2026\n\nWas gonna say, so Itachi's Susanoo would be the **only** one with straight melee, so I can only imagine how his Susanoo would fight, it'd be intense. Low budget episode - slow swords clashing and whatever he's against I imagine sword and sword contact, pushing against each other, slow low-animated battle...\n\nHigh budget episode - We get something kinda like Naruto/Sasuke's Susanoo VS. Momoshiki intense, \"poorly\" animated maybe like Pain vs. Naruto **but** Itachi's Susanoo going ham, like absolutely bouncing around the screen, doing all sorts of melee moves, and deflections.",

New Otsutsuki members popping up is okay, even if they are stronger than Kaguya.\n\nBut the cyborgs make me want to drop the whole thing, so far there\u00b4s a MinatoxSasuke x10, Coochie Magic cyborg with more unknown powers, and instakill murderrevenge grade schooler who\u00b4s more annoying than every yelling shonen protagonist altogether.",

The only people we see able to harm the Perfect Susanoo are Kaguya and Six Paths Naruto.\n\nThen we get to the mobility aspect. Perfect Susanoos are capable of flight whereas I don't think Itachi's Susanoo even has legs.",

Like Kakashi\u2019s dad, and more missing exciting things\u2026\n\nWas gonna say, so Itachi's Susanoo would be the **only** one with straight melee, so I can only imagine how his Susanoo would fight, it'd be intense. Low budget episode - slow swords clashing and whatever he's against I imagine sword and sword contact, pushing against each other, slow low-animated battle...\n\nHigh budget episode - We get something kinda like Naruto/Sasuke's Susanoo VS. Momoshiki intense, \"poorly\" animated maybe like Pain vs. Naruto **but** Itachi's Susanoo going ham, like absolutely bouncing around the screen, doing all sorts of melee moves, and deflections.",

It's a lot faster than it took anyone else but sure whatever. But being able to throw it and adding nature transformation?\n\nAre you even trying at that point?",

They\u2019re done.\n\nA skyscraper or more tall Susanoo with those abilities like shit, wish we could see it just once, somewhere. Like Kakashi\u2019s dad, and more missing exciting things\u2026\n\nWas gonna say, so Itachi's Susanoo would be the **only** one with straight melee, so I can only imagine how his Susanoo would fight, it'd be intense. Low budget episode - slow swords clashing and whatever he's against I imagine sword and sword contact, pushing against each other, slow low-animated battle...\n\nHigh budget episode - We get something kinda like Naruto/Sasuke's Susanoo VS. Momoshiki intense, \"poorly\" animated maybe like Pain vs. Naruto **but** Itachi's Susanoo going ham, like absolutely bouncing around the screen, doing all sorts of melee moves, and deflections.",

It's a lot faster than it took anyone else but sure whatever. But being able to throw it and adding nature transformation?\n\nAre you even trying at that point?",

Thats where boruto and gen can develop and grow. Naruto didn't fight Orochimaru as a 12 year old, the heavy hitting fights were left to the older ninja.",

They can go around fighting random jonin 300 times a day around the world. Yeah their presence does help stop larger threats (like how Gojo single handedly tipped the scales in favor of the sorcerers ) but they won't deal with everything. Thats where boruto and gen can develop and grow. Naruto didn't fight Orochimaru as a 12 year old, the heavy hitting fights were left to the older ninja.",
