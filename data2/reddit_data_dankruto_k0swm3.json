Not to mention the prophecy.  But besides all that it doesn\u2019t really make sense for the leaf to have their strongest ninja sitting at home babysitting a 2 year old. \n\nIt actually makes sense that Jiraiya shows up into narutos life when he did. Naruto had passed the academy and was a genin. He was still a kid but old enough for Jiraiya to start teaching him. Now wether or not kishi had thought this out idk.",

Hes legit near the bottom of my hokage rankings but people are too small brained and hate him because kishi didnt bother to show every single minute of narutos childhood. Do you really think Naruto was left alone? No. Its a plot hole. He obviously had handlers, the kid was an orphan from the day he was born. He had to have had people living with him for his childhood, or else he\u2019d be dead. He\u2019s 12 when the series starts which is still young as hell but at least feasible that he could live alone and have someone check up on him instead of living with him. This is the same show that has child soldiers so yeah 12 yo living alone for us is unthinkable but not really in narutos world. Half of hashiramas siblings died under like age of 10. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even mentioning it makes no sense for Hiruzen to personally watch Naruto as hes busy being the hokage. And even further supported in the narrative because at every single turn Naruto praises Hiruzen. But because people can\u2019t think for themselves hes hated by the fandom.",

Not to mention the prophecy.  But besides all that it doesn\u2019t really make sense for the leaf to have their strongest ninja sitting at home babysitting a 2 year old. \n\nIt actually makes sense that Jiraiya shows up into narutos life when he did. Naruto had passed the academy and was a genin. He was still a kid but old enough for Jiraiya to start teaching him. Now wether or not kishi had thought this out idk.",

Hes legit near the bottom of my hokage rankings but people are too small brained and hate him because kishi didnt bother to show every single minute of narutos childhood. Do you really think Naruto was left alone? No. Its a plot hole. He obviously had handlers, the kid was an orphan from the day he was born. He had to have had people living with him for his childhood, or else he\u2019d be dead. He\u2019s 12 when the series starts which is still young as hell but at least feasible that he could live alone and have someone check up on him instead of living with him. This is the same show that has child soldiers so yeah 12 yo living alone for us is unthinkable but not really in narutos world. Half of hashiramas siblings died under like age of 10. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even mentioning it makes no sense for Hiruzen to personally watch Naruto as hes busy being the hokage. And even further supported in the narrative because at every single turn Naruto praises Hiruzen. But because people can\u2019t think for themselves hes hated by the fandom.",

But besides all that it doesn\u2019t really make sense for the leaf to have their strongest ninja sitting at home babysitting a 2 year old. \n\nIt actually makes sense that Jiraiya shows up into narutos life when he did.
