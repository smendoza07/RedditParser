Man does spread awareness about the usage and safety of PEDs - he is a known user and supporter of it, which is one of the positive things about Greg. But he is more concerned with proving his view-points than respecting the autonomy of other people.\n\nThe main argument, the thread with which this controversy lives on is kinda ridiculous. KJK has been completely transparent and inviting but Greg continues to insist that he could not achieve that physique unless A. PEDs or B. He is extremely lucky. One is testable and can interpreted by a medical professional, the other is... how does he plan to scientifically prove that KJK is a 'one in a million freak'?\n\nI should note there is nothing inherently wrong with PED use. An individual sets their own physique/performance goals and may use whatever ethical AND safe means to achieve it.\n\nIf a person wants to be out about his PED use, they will do it themselves. If a person says they don't use PEDs and goes to great lengths to prove it with KJK's level of transparency, it is more mature for Greg to, if he must, err on the side of believing KJK. Greg is an advocate for safety which I respect but these sorts of things sow greater disunity for health and fitness advocacy than not.\n\nIf he changed his approach, both he and KJK could have been two fitness influencers having a fantastic discussion on safe pursuit of better health and fitness\\*, and that's what their interaction could have been remembered for. Instead, he went for the low hanging fruit: \"natty or not?\" lol.\n\n\\*Edit: rephrased, spelling, grammar",

[Yes, he is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFgsJBiM6vs)\n\n\\*I'll break down some terms and simplify the science that is being tossed around in this issue:\n\n**Steroids are important/necessary hormones** that naturally occur in all our bodies. There are different types of steroids, but the steroids here refer to \"anabolic\" steroids, and the effect particular to anabolic steroids is muscle building.\n\nThere are different types of [exogenous (or, from outside the body)](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/246373) steroids and different ways to administer it.\n\nPED stands for \"***performance enhancing*** drug\". In the fitness (and greater sports) community, **PEDs refer to the use of exogenous steroids for the objective of better results after exercise**: what this looks like is increased muscle gain in a short period of time, decreased recovery time after a session, etc.\n\nThe type of PED Coach Greg is accusing Kim Jong Kook of using is hormone/testosterone replacement therapy, or HRT/TRT. **Testosterone is a naturally occuring steroid in our bodies, but as we get older, males naturally produce less testosterone**. [In more extreme cases, a doctor may prescribe this therapy to their patient.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406807/)\n\nIn this case, Greg's claims are that KJK's physique is due either to TRT, or that KJK is just a one-in-a-million genetic 'freak of nature'. I don't know where Greg gets his \"this physique is one-in-a-million rare\" statistic from, however. Seems anecdotal and scientifically unfounded.\n\nGreg does continue to insist KJK is on this \"HRT/TRT\" due to KJK's test results which indicate that his testosterone levels are on the higher end. This is the piece of evidence that Greg uses to argue that KJK is in fact using HRT. **Central to Greg's argument is that it's either due to HRT, or it's 'one-in-a-million' that any person would have a testosterone reading that high.** (again, is his source anecdotal or scientific? Or is it a fixation on his belief?). That's the single thread.\n\nHope that clears things up!\n\nFor more information and numbers, [here is a nice article from the Korea Herald that describes what is the usual testosterone range of a man and what KJK tested.](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20211115000342)\n\nI'll report it here:\n\nThe average figure is 2.7 - 10.7 nanograms per milliliter; KJK tested recently for 8.38 nanograms per milliliter at the age of 45.\n\n\\*Edit: Elaborated",

This is why the results from KJK's testosterone test is the evidence he's using to continue pushing. \n\nBecause from the test results Greg can make claims like \"it's 99% TRT and 1% luck\". This claim is just a claim and stays a claim. On the other hand, Greg himself says it's impossible to test whether it's just genetic luck: an argument that is safe and convenient for Greg. \n\nIt's really better that KJK ends this ridiculous controversy than to feed into that ridiculousness haha.",

In this niche, it's also good to educate for those who are interested in using, which Greg does from time to time.\n\nBut the glaring problem with the \"natty or not\"; \"is this person using or not\" approach reveals itself in the KJK issue. Sure, people within the fitness community may have generally more accepting attitudes towards the use of PEDs but outside it's still rather stigmatized.\n\nThe natty/not videos can be said to educate those who are primed for it. But the niche is the fitness community. Outside of it, it looks as if one is taking aim at the other with the objective of diminishing the other's achievments.\n\nOne thing I wish Greg does instead of 'call-outs' is to dive deeper towards the people he calls out. Form genuine connections with these people and learn their stories instead of firing claims like mortar shells and if one hits, then great. Maybe he can understand why people say they do/don't do steroids instead of speculation. And if someone is a PED user, he might be able to highlight their reasons behind PED use to achieve their goals, with a reduced possibility of stigmatizing them. But that's not his format. \n\nI stopped watching Greg because I felt that his videos sometimes boundaried on tabloidism. It's quick and easy to speculate. A deeper investigation is more challenging but more rewarding. Everyone is free to educate, but it's difficult to be an effective educator.\n\nBut this is now off topic. Sorry mods!",

It's his whole schtick, preaching realistic expectations to his viewers in their pursuit of fitness/bodybuilding.\n\nIMO the reason this situation has blown up is because of cultural differences. Korea is of course not as progressive as the US/Canada when it comes to their opinion of PED's, steroids, drugs etc and because of this the Korean media/public has perceived Gregs opinion (that KJK has likely taken PED's at some point in his life) as an attack against KJK's character and this is pretty much where the controversy comes from, the level of response from the media/public/KJK himself pretty much says it all.\n\nGreg has done tons of these kind of videos on other famous public figures (Hollywood, famous social media influencers and so on) and none of those videos have garnered a response quite like the one we're seeing now lol",

Though i think where Greg can be at fault is when after the initial statement by KJK, he continued to double down on his accusations and pushed it even further. I believe that\u2019s when it pushed KJk in a corner to take this response. Remember that korean media is not kind to controversies surrounding their celebrities. If just left unaddressed, these rumors/accusations could grow and lead to KJK losing sponsorships and shows. And that\u2019s where i understand KJK was responding the way he is now with the videos and tests to clear his name of all this. If he don\u2019t respond properly to these allegations, he\u2019ll be the one who gets crucified in korean media.",

The MLB is practically the only big league that actively cracks down on it, the rest of the big leagues like the NBA, NFL, boxing, etc. have their athletes regularly taking them. So I don't think it's progressiveness, but USA turning a blind eye in the name of competition and entertainment. Otherwise the fans would be rioting against the MLB for their crackdown on PEDs. Progressiveness is if it's accepted out in the open.\n\nI don't know much about the NHL to be saying stuff, but I wouldn't be surprised either. I don't think they're taking stuff though, just 3 years ago or something an accountant subbed in for a goalie and stopped several field goals by a top team.",

It's a sad reality. He's getting too wound up over this.  \n\\- I don't believe KJK uses drugs  \n\\- Clearly Korea doesn't believe it either  \n\\- So I think he shouldn't make a big deal out of this. Suing Greg is going too far.  \n\\- Greg says the blood results doesn't prove a thing. And that makes sense. But it suggests that KJK *could* be taking something. Do I think he does? Of course not. But this could damage his image. Not Greg's analysis, but KJK's response",

            "body": "Hello, r/runningman I am a huge fan of both Running Man and bodybuilding. I couldn't help but notice that many of you have been misinformed by the media about the steroid accusation against KJK. Greg Doucette, a well-known bodybuilder/YouTuber made a video on KJK stating his opinion on whether KJK is \"natural\" or not. Many of you seem to be under the impression that Greg bet one million dollars that KJK abuses steroids. This is simply not true. In this video, Greg points out that KJK has a very good physique, especially for his age. He concludes that if he had to take a GUESS and his life or a million dollars was on the line, he would say that KJK takes HRT. HRT stands for hormone replacement therapy and can be prescribed by doctors to reduce the risk of hearts disease, diabetes, etc in older men as their testosterone levels decline. Greg never once CLAIMED KJK \"abuses\" steroids or that KJK is on steroids at all. It was just his opinion. This opinion is not shocking or disrespectful at all as KJK's physique is very hard to achieve at such an age. In the bodybuilding world steroids are common and someone who looks as good as KJK is often not natural. With all this in mind, it makes sense why one might think KJK may have taken steroids. Greg never bet a million dollars nor did Greg dismiss the hard training and dieting that KJK does. People on steroids actually tend to work harder as they are that committed to that lifestyle.",

Man does spread awareness about the usage and safety of PEDs - he is a known user and supporter of it, which is one of the positive things about Greg. But he is more concerned with proving his view-points than respecting the autonomy of other people.\n\nThe main argument, the thread with which this controversy lives on is kinda ridiculous. KJK has been completely transparent and inviting but Greg continues to insist that he could not achieve that physique unless A. PEDs or B. He is extremely lucky. One is testable and can interpreted by a medical professional, the other is... how does he plan to scientifically prove that KJK is a 'one in a million freak'?\n\nI should note there is nothing inherently wrong with PED use. An individual sets their own physique/performance goals and may use whatever ethical AND safe means to achieve it.\n\nIf a person wants to be out about his PED use, they will do it themselves. If a person says they don't use PEDs and goes to great lengths to prove it with KJK's level of transparency, it is more mature for Greg to, if he must, err on the side of believing KJK. Greg is an advocate for safety which I respect but these sorts of things sow greater disunity for health and fitness advocacy than not.\n\nIf he changed his approach, both he and KJK could have been two fitness influencers having a fantastic discussion on safe pursuit of better health and fitness\\*, and that's what their interaction could have been remembered for. Instead, he went for the low hanging fruit: \"natty or not?\" lol.\n\n\\*Edit: rephrased, spelling, grammar",

[Yes, he is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFgsJBiM6vs)\n\n\\*I'll break down some terms and simplify the science that is being tossed around in this issue:\n\n**Steroids are important/necessary hormones** that naturally occur in all our bodies. There are different types of steroids, but the steroids here refer to \"anabolic\" steroids, and the effect particular to anabolic steroids is muscle building.\n\nThere are different types of [exogenous (or, from outside the body)](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/246373) steroids and different ways to administer it.\n\nPED stands for \"***performance enhancing*** drug\". In the fitness (and greater sports) community, **PEDs refer to the use of exogenous steroids for the objective of better results after exercise**: what this looks like is increased muscle gain in a short period of time, decreased recovery time after a session, etc.\n\nThe type of PED Coach Greg is accusing Kim Jong Kook of using is hormone/testosterone replacement therapy, or HRT/TRT. **Testosterone is a naturally occuring steroid in our bodies, but as we get older, males naturally produce less testosterone**. [In more extreme cases, a doctor may prescribe this therapy to their patient.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406807/)\n\nIn this case, Greg's claims are that KJK's physique is due either to TRT, or that KJK is just a one-in-a-million genetic 'freak of nature'. I don't know where Greg gets his \"this physique is one-in-a-million rare\" statistic from, however. Seems anecdotal and scientifically unfounded.\n\nGreg does continue to insist KJK is on this \"HRT/TRT\" due to KJK's test results which indicate that his testosterone levels are on the higher end. This is the piece of evidence that Greg uses to argue that KJK is in fact using HRT. **Central to Greg's argument is that it's either due to HRT, or it's 'one-in-a-million' that any person would have a testosterone reading that high.** (again, is his source anecdotal or scientific? Or is it a fixation on his belief?). That's the single thread.\n\nHope that clears things up!\n\nFor more information and numbers, [here is a nice article from the Korea Herald that describes what is the usual testosterone range of a man and what KJK tested.](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20211115000342)\n\nI'll report it here:\n\nThe average figure is 2.7 - 10.7 nanograms per milliliter; KJK tested recently for 8.38 nanograms per milliliter at the age of 45.\n\n\\*Edit: Elaborated",

In this niche, it's also good to educate for those who are interested in using, which Greg does from time to time.\n\nBut the glaring problem with the \"natty or not\"; \"is this person using or not\" approach reveals itself in the KJK issue. Sure, people within the fitness community may have generally more accepting attitudes towards the use of PEDs but outside it's still rather stigmatized.\n\nThe natty/not videos can be said to educate those who are primed for it. But the niche is the fitness community. Outside of it, it looks as if one is taking aim at the other with the objective of diminishing the other's achievments.\n\nOne thing I wish Greg does instead of 'call-outs' is to dive deeper towards the people he calls out. Form genuine connections with these people and learn their stories instead of firing claims like mortar shells and if one hits, then great. Maybe he can understand why people say they do/don't do steroids instead of speculation. And if someone is a PED user, he might be able to highlight their reasons behind PED use to achieve their goals, with a reduced possibility of stigmatizing them. But that's not his format. \n\nI stopped watching Greg because I felt that his videos sometimes boundaried on tabloidism. It's quick and easy to speculate. A deeper investigation is more challenging but more rewarding. Everyone is free to educate, but it's difficult to be an effective educator.\n\nBut this is now off topic. Sorry mods!",

It's his whole schtick, preaching realistic expectations to his viewers in their pursuit of fitness/bodybuilding.\n\nIMO the reason this situation has blown up is because of cultural differences. Korea is of course not as progressive as the US/Canada when it comes to their opinion of PED's, steroids, drugs etc and because of this the Korean media/public has perceived Gregs opinion (that KJK has likely taken PED's at some point in his life) as an attack against KJK's character and this is pretty much where the controversy comes from, the level of response from the media/public/KJK himself pretty much says it all.\n\nGreg has done tons of these kind of videos on other famous public figures (Hollywood, famous social media influencers and so on) and none of those videos have garnered a response quite like the one we're seeing now lol",

I believe that\u2019s when it pushed KJk in a corner to take this response. Remember that korean media is not kind to controversies surrounding their celebrities. If just left unaddressed, these rumors/accusations could grow and lead to KJK losing sponsorships and shows. And that\u2019s where i understand KJK was responding the way he is now with the videos and tests to clear his name of all this.

The MLB is practically the only big league that actively cracks down on it, the rest of the big leagues like the NBA, NFL, boxing, etc. have their athletes regularly taking them. So I don't think it's progressiveness, but USA turning a blind eye in the name of competition and entertainment. Otherwise the fans would be rioting against the MLB for their crackdown on PEDs. Progressiveness is if it's accepted out in the open.\n\nI don't know much about the NHL to be saying stuff, but I wouldn't be surprised either. I don't think they're taking stuff though, just 3 years ago or something an accountant subbed in for a goalie and stopped several field goals by a top team.",

Man does spread awareness about the usage and safety of PEDs - he is a known user and supporter of it, which is one of the positive things about Greg. But he is more concerned with proving his view-points than respecting the autonomy of other people.\n\nThe main argument, the thread with which this controversy lives on is kinda ridiculous. KJK has been completely transparent and inviting but Greg continues to insist that he could not achieve that physique unless A. PEDs or B. He is extremely lucky. One is testable and can interpreted by a medical professional, the other is... how does he plan to scientifically prove that KJK is a 'one in a million freak'?\n\nI should note there is nothing inherently wrong with PED use. An individual sets their own physique/performance goals and may use whatever ethical AND safe means to achieve it.\n\nIf a person wants to be out about his PED use, they will do it themselves. If a person says they don't use PEDs and goes to great lengths to prove it with KJK's level of transparency, it is more mature for Greg to, if he must, err on the side of believing KJK. Greg is an advocate for safety which I respect but these sorts of things sow greater disunity for health and fitness advocacy than not.\n\nIf he changed his approach, both he and KJK could have been two fitness influencers having a fantastic discussion on safe pursuit of better health and fitness\\*, and that's what their interaction could have been remembered for. Instead, he went for the low hanging fruit: \"natty or not?\" lol.\n\n\\*Edit: rephrased, spelling, grammar",

[Yes, he is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFgsJBiM6vs)\n\n\\*I'll break down some terms and simplify the science that is being tossed around in this issue:\n\n**Steroids are important/necessary hormones** that naturally occur in all our bodies. There are different types of steroids, but the steroids here refer to \"anabolic\" steroids, and the effect particular to anabolic steroids is muscle building.\n\nThere are different types of [exogenous (or, from outside the body)](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/246373) steroids and different ways to administer it.\n\nPED stands for \"***performance enhancing*** drug\". In the fitness (and greater sports) community, **PEDs refer to the use of exogenous steroids for the objective of better results after exercise**: what this looks like is increased muscle gain in a short period of time, decreased recovery time after a session, etc.\n\nThe type of PED Coach Greg is accusing Kim Jong Kook of using is hormone/testosterone replacement therapy, or HRT/TRT. **Testosterone is a naturally occuring steroid in our bodies, but as we get older, males naturally produce less testosterone**. [In more extreme cases, a doctor may prescribe this therapy to their patient.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406807/)\n\nIn this case, Greg's claims are that KJK's physique is due either to TRT, or that KJK is just a one-in-a-million genetic 'freak of nature'. I don't know where Greg gets his \"this physique is one-in-a-million rare\" statistic from, however. Seems anecdotal and scientifically unfounded.\n\nGreg does continue to insist KJK is on this \"HRT/TRT\" due to KJK's test results which indicate that his testosterone levels are on the higher end. This is the piece of evidence that Greg uses to argue that KJK is in fact using HRT. **Central to Greg's argument is that it's either due to HRT, or it's 'one-in-a-million' that any person would have a testosterone reading that high.** (again, is his source anecdotal or scientific? Or is it a fixation on his belief?). That's the single thread.\n\nHope that clears things up!\n\nFor more information and numbers, [here is a nice article from the Korea Herald that describes what is the usual testosterone range of a man and what KJK tested.](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20211115000342)\n\nI'll report it here:\n\nThe average figure is 2.7 - 10.7 nanograms per milliliter; KJK tested recently for 8.38 nanograms per milliliter at the age of 45.\n\n\\*Edit: Elaborated",

Sure, people within the fitness community may have generally more accepting attitudes towards the use of PEDs but outside it's still rather stigmatized.\n\nThe natty/not videos can be said to educate those who are primed for it. But the niche is the fitness community. Outside of it, it looks as if one is taking aim at the other with the objective of diminishing the other's achievments.\n\nOne thing I wish Greg does instead of 'call-outs' is to dive deeper towards the people he calls out. Form genuine connections with these people and learn their stories instead of firing claims like mortar shells and if one hits, then great. Maybe he can understand why people say they do/don't do steroids instead of speculation. And if someone is a PED user, he might be able to highlight their reasons behind PED use to achieve their goals, with a reduced possibility of stigmatizing them. But that's not his format. \n\nI stopped watching Greg because I felt that his videos sometimes boundaried on tabloidism. It's quick and easy to speculate. A deeper investigation is more challenging but more rewarding. Everyone is free to educate, but it's difficult to be an effective educator.\n\nBut this is now off topic. Sorry mods!",

Man does spread awareness about the usage and safety of PEDs - he is a known user and supporter of it, which is one of the positive things about Greg. But he is more concerned with proving his view-points than respecting the autonomy of other people.\n\nThe main argument, the thread with which this controversy lives on is kinda ridiculous. KJK has been completely transparent and inviting but Greg continues to insist that he could not achieve that physique unless A. PEDs or B. He is extremely lucky. One is testable and can interpreted by a medical professional, the other is... how does he plan to scientifically prove that KJK is a 'one in a million freak'?\n\nI should note there is nothing inherently wrong with PED use. An individual sets their own physique/performance goals and may use whatever ethical AND safe means to achieve it.\n\nIf a person wants to be out about his PED use, they will do it themselves. If a person says they don't use PEDs and goes to great lengths to prove it with KJK's level of transparency, it is more mature for Greg to, if he must, err on the side of believing KJK. Greg is an advocate for safety which I respect but these sorts of things sow greater disunity for health and fitness advocacy than not.\n\nIf he changed his approach, both he and KJK could have been two fitness influencers having a fantastic discussion on safe pursuit of better health and fitness\\*, and that's what their interaction could have been remembered for. Instead, he went for the low hanging fruit: \"natty or not?\" lol.\n\n\\*Edit: rephrased, spelling, grammar",

In this niche, it's also good to educate for those who are interested in using, which Greg does from time to time.\n\nBut the glaring problem with the \"natty or not\"; \"is this person using or not\" approach reveals itself in the KJK issue. Sure, people within the fitness community may have generally more accepting attitudes towards the use of PEDs but outside it's still rather stigmatized.\n\nThe natty/not videos can be said to educate those who are primed for it. But the niche is the fitness community. Outside of it, it looks as if one is taking aim at the other with the objective of diminishing the other's achievments.\n\nOne thing I wish Greg does instead of 'call-outs' is to dive deeper towards the people he calls out. Form genuine connections with these people and learn their stories instead of firing claims like mortar shells and if one hits, then great. Maybe he can understand why people say they do/don't do steroids instead of speculation. And if someone is a PED user, he might be able to highlight their reasons behind PED use to achieve their goals, with a reduced possibility of stigmatizing them. But that's not his format. \n\nI stopped watching Greg because I felt that his videos sometimes boundaried on tabloidism. It's quick and easy to speculate. A deeper investigation is more challenging but more rewarding. Everyone is free to educate, but it's difficult to be an effective educator.\n\nBut this is now off topic. Sorry mods!",

This is the piece of evidence that Greg uses to argue that KJK is in fact using HRT. **Central to Greg's argument is that it's either due to HRT, or it's 'one-in-a-million' that any person would have a testosterone reading that high.** (again, is his source anecdotal or scientific? Or is it a fixation on his belief?). That's the single thread.\n\nHope that clears things up!\n\nFor more information and numbers, [here is a nice article from the Korea Herald that describes what is the usual testosterone range of a man and what KJK tested.](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20211115000342)\n\nI'll report it here:\n\nThe average figure is 2.7 - 10.7 nanograms per milliliter; KJK tested recently for 8.38 nanograms per milliliter at the age of 45.\n\n\\*Edit: Elaborated",
