And JWJ is really funny, un-predictive and stupid at the same like LKS and even though KJK is on the show, JWJ gets enough footage on his own without trying hard. \n\nIf you watch it you'll immediately realize the difference between the KJK of RM and KJK of this show. Maybe because of KJK's different role in these two shows and the different format of these shows as well. But, it's a good show which you can give it a try.",

Also idk about everyone but I have always felt that JWJ is not very funny, his humor and execution feels stiff. And maybe I'm a little off on the mark, but I think he can't laugh at himself. He got irritated when Jae Seok was showing his teeth, now here funny guy must have translated to him as comedian so he corrected them by repeatedly saying he's a model.",

And it becomes clear he takes the trials and tribulations that variety foists on him with a very light, playful touch.\n\nHe\u2019s really coming into this own variety-wise. It\u2019s been fun seeing it, because I used to watch Sechan and Woo Jae in the traveling dating show they used to do together, and Woo Jae was basically a background prop on that show. He barely made any impact. But things are dramatically different now.",

And maybe I'm a little off on the mark, but I think he can't laugh at himself.\n\nHe is NOT A COMEDIAN. He is different kind of person which makes people happy by not showing any kind emotions or very less emotions on his face in situations. If we compare LKS with JWJ, you'll realize that the LKS is very expressive and that made him best or one of the best in the reality/variety shows. But compared to LKS, JWJ is not that expressive but what he does or says is similar to what LKS did in the past. But JWJ is different that the LKS. But there is no doubt he is funny, even if you watch this show you'll realize that. The games they played to choose the room, conversations between them especially with KJK when KJK suggested that he can sleep on couch and JWJ replied to KJK instantly to do that. It's funny.\n\n>He got irritated when Jae Seok was showing his teeth\n\nYou need people to respond you in any way to get attention. You don't want only RM member teasing JWJ only in one direction only. That would become boring after some time. And in fact, it was good when he got irritated with YJS so that means he is totally engrossed in the situation and showing his true emotions which is the IMPORTANT FACTOR to get screen time in reality/variety shows.\n\nEDIT: many guests who came of RM hardly shows any reactions or respond back and that doesn't help them to get more screen time, in fact they get very few screen time because of they don't show their \"real self\" and hence RM fans hardly talks about them. There are very few guests who really clicked with the RM members and definitely JWJ is one of the them, no doubt.",

I do watch this show and I still don't find him funny. It's just my opinion, why so serious?  Suddenly talking about how variety shows work, screen times, and comparing him and kwangsoo, when it doesn't change the fact that he is what I said he is. This all boils down to difference in opinion, but you want to act as if its a fact that he's funny and you wouldn't want it any other way. Again, it's my opinion that he's not funny regardless of how others find him entertaining, I've already said that before. Don't be so upset about this.",

And I accept that not every RM fans loves every guests, including RM members. \n\nI am just telling you why RM fans loves him more than they loved any other guests who appeared in this show. He is different which is I don't think it's everyone's cup of tea, most of the RM fans loves him might be because there is a gap after departure of LKS, maybe he reminds then of LKS, etc. \n\nBut I get your point. He is \"different\", but sometime you gets bored seeing similar stuff such as only comedians doing comedy, and you get excited when unexpectedly, someone brings laughter who were not supposed to in the first place.\n\nEdit: JWJ first appeared on the show in the \"Model\" episode where no one expected him to bring laughter but he managed to do that without trying hard with his interactions with other members, his imitation of other celebrities, etc. And I think that's why RM fans loved him.",

And it becomes clear he takes the trials and tribulations that variety foists on him with a very light, playful touch.\n\nHe\u2019s really coming into this own variety-wise. It\u2019s been fun seeing it, because I used to watch Sechan and Woo Jae in the traveling dating show they used to do together, and Woo Jae was basically a background prop on that show. He barely made any impact. But things are dramatically different now.",

            "body": ">I have always felt that JWJ is not very funny, his humor and execution feels stiff. And maybe I'm a little off on the mark, but I think he can't laugh at himself.\n\nHe is NOT A COMEDIAN. He is different kind of person which makes people happy by not showing any kind emotions or very less emotions on his face in situations. If we compare LKS with JWJ, you'll realize that the LKS is very expressive and that made him best or one of the best in the reality/variety shows. But compared to LKS, JWJ is not that expressive but what he does or says is similar to what LKS did in the past. But JWJ is different that the LKS. But there is no doubt he is funny, even if you watch this show you'll realize that. The games they played to choose the room, conversations between them especially with KJK when KJK suggested that he can sleep on couch and JWJ replied to KJK instantly to do that. It's funny.\n\n>He got irritated when Jae Seok was showing his teeth\n\nYou need people to respond you in any way to get attention. You don't want only RM member teasing JWJ only in one direction only. That would become boring after some time. And in fact, it was good when he got irritated with YJS so that means he is totally engrossed in the situation and showing his true emotions which is the IMPORTANT FACTOR to get screen time in reality/variety shows.\n\nEDIT: many guests who came of RM hardly shows any reactions or respond back and that doesn't help them to get more screen time, in fact they get very few screen time because of they don't show their \"real self\" and hence RM fans hardly talks about them. There are very few guests who really clicked with the RM members and definitely JWJ is one of the them, no doubt.",

And I accept that not every RM fans loves every guests, including RM members. \n\nI am just telling you why RM fans loves him more than they loved any other guests who appeared in this show. He is different which is I don't think it's everyone's cup of tea, most of the RM fans loves him might be because there is a gap after departure of LKS, maybe he reminds then of LKS, etc. \n\nBut I get your point. He is \"different\", but sometime you gets bored seeing similar stuff such as only comedians doing comedy, and you get excited when unexpectedly, someone brings laughter who were not supposed to in the first place.\n\nEdit: JWJ first appeared on the show in the \"Model\" episode where no one expected him to bring laughter but he managed to do that without trying hard with his interactions with other members, his imitation of other celebrities, etc. And I think that's why RM fans loved him.",
