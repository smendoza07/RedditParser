    "body": "I am SO SICK of Splenda daddies. \n\nI\u2019ve been talking to this guy all morning and it really seemed liked we were coming to an understanding about what we both want. Then we finally get to talking about meeting up and it\u2019s excuse after excuse. \n\nWe originally discussed a weekly allowance and agreed on a amount that was good for both of us (it was a hundred less than I originally wanted but he was cute), we also agreed on meeting twice a week for said amount. Once we started talking about meeting he says \u201c yea I just have to run to the bank and take out x amount for you\u201d. X being half of the weekly allowance we discussed. ( as if he was just paying for the one meeting, as if we discussed a ppm). Then before I could respond he says \u201chey the hotel room is a little more expensive than expected plus I wanted to get us some drinks. So I\u2019ll just give you (X - 50) today and give you X next time.\u201d \n\nI went off. I couldn\u2019t even help it. I was already letting this man off the hook of my real ppm by giving him the weekly allowance at the same price as my ppm. And then on top of that we wants to cut that price in half so he never has to pay the rest. It\u2019s bullshit. I\u2019m so fucking tired of people going back on their word. It\u2019s a genuine pet peeve of mine. So sick of being undervalued in the bowl. Maybe it\u2019s just time to move on. Hopefully I\u2019ll find someone by the end of this month. But if not, I might officially call it quits. \n\nThank you for coming to Ted talk.",

If he can\u2019t afford/won\u2019t give what you\u2019re determined to get, then move on as soon as that is established. \n\nSome tips:\n\n\u2022 *Always* go for PPM until you\u2019ve at least spent a little bit of time together. There are certain scenarios in which going immediately to an allowance might be appropriate, but it\u2019s *certainly* a risk for both parties involved, regardless. The SD risks losing some money if he chooses to give an allowance up front. The SB, however, risks being intimate on a date for nothing if she agrees to an allowance right out of the gate and doesn\u2019t receive it before any intimacy takes place. \n\n\u2022 Basing a *vanilla* relationship on looks alone and compromising your own needs/morals/values/whatever else rarely ends well. It\u2019s an even worse idea as a SB in the bowl. (It\u2019s not a great idea from the SD end, either, but they\u2019re definitely more commonly searching for a specific physical attraction.) Don\u2019t ever make this trade off, again. It doesn\u2019t matter how cute he is if y\u2019all aren\u2019t fundamentally compatible. \n\n\u2022 The *moment* certain red flags pop up (offering half of a supposed allowance in return for one date, saying he\u2019s subtracting from an \u201callowance\u201d for the price of a room/drinks), end things. Some things can be looked past while getting to know a POT, others cannot and should not be looked past. \n\n\u2022 Patience is *truly* a virtue, especially in the sugar world. Don\u2019t give yourself a one month deadline if this is actually something you want to do! It can take months on end to find that perfect SR, and it\u2019ll surely be worth it, if you put in the work to screen, go on M&Gs, have open and honest conversations etc. and let go of some of these hang ups. \n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t ever sugar out of desperation. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing; compromising on things like money, circumstances surrounding dates etc. are things that desperate SBs do, and this will always lead to disappointment, and often leads to being taken advantage of. \n\nYou learned some valuable lessons! Don\u2019t give up if you genuinely want to be in a sugar relationship. \n\nGood luck!",

I very often start with a monthly allowance, split into bi-monthly at the start.  The first half happens on the first date (before intimacy), the second half happens on our first date on/after the 15th.\n\nI realize some view this is additional risk to me (as an SD).  I actually view it a way to reduce risk.  If a girl is willing to both sleep with me + literally fuck me over, losing the part of an allowance is a cheap cost to expose her true colors.  If we have a complete mismatch after intimacy - I can also walk away a bit more guilt free as she's getting a half month allowance.  (not just a single PPM).\n\nFrom her perspective, I'm not really sure the increased risk.  \n\nNow - someone pulling a bait & switch is a risk.  But that's a risk no matter what.  They can just easily pull PPM after intimacy, as they can pull allowance after intimacy.",

I'm like well maybe we can work something out on a monthly basis and we can see each other 2 times a month.  Guess what he says?  'Once is all the funds will allow.

As much as he may not pay you for the future events that haven't happened yet, you may not show for the future events that haven't happened yet.   In your scenario he accepts 100% of the risk and you get no risk.  In his scenario he pre-pays and therefore accepts some risk but is hedging his bets because ... you are likely to go off and lose it and walk away.  Which you did.\n\nHe is probably thinking \"good catch on my part before she scammed me\".\n\nI don't agree with lowering the amount because the hotel or drinks costs more nonsense but when the trust is earned on both sides then go to allowance.\n\nedit:  I should say that I just re-read it and saw it was a weekly allowance which does make some difference but the point of my post still stands.

It's understandable to split a monthly allowance up at the start;  but even then, you aren't doing it on a per visit basis.  Per visit just makes it PPM.\n\n> and I see hosting and any room costs as a shared obligation\n\nUh, no.  Saying the allowance is changing because the cost of the hotel is fucking insane.

Yes, lowering an allowance to cover the cost of a room means the SB helped pay for said room. You directly contradicted yourself in claiming that sugaring should never cost the SB anything and then going on to say the rest. \n\nIn response to your initial comment, splitting a \u201cweekly allowance\u201d into equal, per-visit amounts is literally just PPM.

There are certain scenarios in which going immediately to an allowance might be appropriate, but it\u2019s certainly a risk for both parties involved, regardless. \n\nI do not understand this.  I very often start with a monthly allowance, split into bi-monthly at the start.  The first half happens on the first date (before intimacy), the second half happens on our first date on/after the 15th.\n\nI realize some view this is additional risk to me (as an SD).  I actually view it a way to reduce risk.  If a girl is willing to both sleep with me + literally fuck me over, losing the part of an allowance is a cheap cost to expose her true colors.  If we have a complete mismatch after intimacy - I can also walk away a bit more guilt free as she's getting a half month allowance.  (not just a single PPM).\n\nFrom her perspective, I'm not really sure the increased risk.  \n\nNow - someone pulling a bait & switch is a risk.  But that's a risk no matter what.  They can just easily pull PPM after intimacy, as they can pull allowance after intimacy.",

No man has any business calling himself a sugar daddy if he cannot manage to figure out a way to host without costing the sugar baby money. Yes, lowering an allowance to cover the cost of a room means the SB helped pay for said room. You directly contradicted yourself in claiming that sugaring should never cost the SB anything and then going on to say the rest. \n\nIn response to your initial comment, splitting a \u201cweekly allowance\u201d into equal, per-visit amounts is literally just PPM. My SD sends me my monthly allowance in two equal amounts every other Friday, regardless of when we\u2019re seeing each other. *That* is an example of an acceptable way to split up an allowance.",
