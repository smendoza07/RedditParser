In a sense, you might be presenting Descartes to the actress, or putting Descartes in front of the actress.  He's also suggesting finding out who the actress's favourite philosopher is first and then approaching the possible actress in class, which would mean finding out about Descartes before asking the person in class.  In both cases, you're putting Descartes before the whores -- or, as the old saying goes, putting the cart before the horse.",

But, I'd like to add that how it lays (how much it \"sticks out\") is somewhat within your control. How you let your hair dry and whether or not you use product will have an effect on this. If you want your hair to stick out a lot, blow dry it. If you want it to lay flatter, pour water over it from the crown after washing and let it air dry.\n\nAlso, you probably already know this but just to be thorough, the guard numbers are in increments of an eighth of an inch, so a 1 is 1/8, 2 is 1/4, 4 is 1/2, 8 is a full inch.\n\nHopefully this thread was actually a little helpful for you and not just hijacked by a joke... :P",

He's also suggesting finding out who the actress's favourite philosopher is first and then approaching the possible actress in class, which would mean finding out about Descartes before asking the person in class.  In both cases, you're putting Descartes before the whores -- or, as the old saying goes, putting the cart before the horse.",

In a sense, you might be presenting Descartes to the actress, or putting Descartes in front of the actress.  He's also suggesting finding out who the actress's favourite philosopher is first and then approaching the possible actress in class, which would mean finding out about Descartes before asking the person in class.  In both cases, you're putting Descartes before the whores -- or, as the old saying goes, putting the cart before the horse.",

Clipper guards are numbered so that #1 is the shortest extension and #5 or #6 is the longest extension.\n\nSee above comments for further explanation of how smashingly clever this really is. ",

And that wasn\u2019t a smart thing to do.\n\n\nYou see, when she wants one and calls out, \u201cYoo-Hoo!\n\n\nCome into the house, Dave!\u201d she doesn\u2019t get one.\n\n\nAll twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!\n\n\nThis makes things quite difficult at the McCaves\u2019\n\n\nAs you can imagine, with so many Daves.\n\n\nAnd often she wishes that, when they were born,\n\n\nShe had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn\n\n\nAnd one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm.\n\n\nAnd one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.\n\n\nAnd one of them Shadrack. And one of them Blinkey.\n\n\nAnd one of them Stuffy. And one of them Stinkey.\n\n\nAnother one Putt-Putt. Another one Moon Face.\n\n\nAnother one Marvin O\u2019Gravel Balloon Face.\n\n\nAnd one of them Ziggy. And one Soggy Muff.\n\n\nOne Buffalo Bill. And one Biffalo Buff.\n\n\nAnd one of them Sneepy. And one Weepy Weed.\n\n\nAnd one Paris Garters. And one Harris Tweed.\n\n\nAnd one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt\n\n\nAnd one of them Oliver Boliver Butt\n\n\nAnd one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate \u2026\n\n\nBut she didn\u2019t do it. And now it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n\n\nToo Many Daves\nby\nDr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel)",

In a sense, you might be presenting Descartes to the actress, or putting Descartes in front of the actress.  He's also suggesting finding out who the actress's favourite philosopher is first and then approaching the possible actress in class, which would mean finding out about Descartes before asking the person in class.  In both cases, you're putting Descartes before the whores -- or, as the old saying goes, putting the cart before the horse.",

Clipper guards are numbered so that #1 is the shortest extension and #5 or #6 is the longest extension.\n\nSee above comments for further explanation of how smashingly clever this really is. ",
