    "body": "[link to OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/hzvf7j/i_had_my_first_ever_mg_today_it_went_amazing_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\nTldr, my very first meet with a POT SD went very well and we clicked on an awesome level. I was wondering WTF is up cause it seems too good to be true.\n\nY\u2019all scared the shit out of me, but I know it was all good intentions. I was a little more skeptical of him, but I still wanted to see what would happen, so we went out again. I got the waygu. \n\nI gave him my dollar amount based on what I read about in here, and what seemed reasonable to me. He doubled it, and gave it to me in cash. Bro what???? I asked him if he wanted to like... make out for a bit? Something? Let me pop your back? \n\nWe made out for like 30 minutes and then he pulled back and said that\u2019s as far as he wants to go tonight. He told me he\u2019s just recently divorced, and wants to take things slow. He didn\u2019t badmouth his ex ONCE. \n\nI asked why he chose SA vs Tinder. He said his ex is a great woman and he doesn\u2019t want to throw a younger, beautiful sweetie around in her face. SA comes with an inherent amount of discretion and a degree of separation. \n\nWow! So he\u2019s emotionally aware, empathetic, respectful of his ex, and has boundaries. And pays cash.",

            "body": "When my ex left me with 3 kids, I had zero time to date...yet, emotionally, I need the touch of a woman.  Queue the escorts...which worked well for  my first year.  Then I found SA, in it's infancy.   It's a very addictive lifestyle.\n\nI had many friends who were concerned that I would jump right back into a serious relationship with the wrong woman.  In hindsight that was a valid concern.  Post-divorce emotions are very tender.  Rebound relationships rarely work out.\n\nA lot of guys want the sex...often porno style.  But some guys, like me want love.  Making out is much more personal & intimate than pounding the p-tang.  Kissing feels special for guys who want love above sex.\n\nSounds like you're off to a good start.  Respect his boundaries and be punctual and polite.  His feelings are all over the globe right now.  You can make him feel special and in the moment.  Take his mind off all the emotional turmoil.  Make him feel special and the SR should grow.",

It's a good start.\n\nWhen we speak about effort, we're talking about many of the basics that modern society has forgotten: being on time; being attentive; being _enthusiastic_ about seeing him and spending time together - taking an active role in the relationship. Just show him that he has the potential to be a positive and important part of your life in this current moment.",

I\u2019m tired of going on dates with people who treat me like an accessory, or simply a step above being alone. Be intentional, you know? Put the phone away, be where you are. Don\u2019t text me the minutia of your day just to have someone to talk to. Don\u2019t invite me over to \u201chang out\u201d cause you can\u2019t be alone. \n\nI\u2019ve had such terrible luck with vanilla dating, I thought I may as well get paid to be treated like a goldfish.

At the risk of 5^4 downvotes perhaps suggest that the allowance be a little less if it is really twice what you thought was reasonable (you may want some offline advise from local F ) . \n\n Let him know how his INVESTMENT in you is making your life and long term prospects better if that appears consistent with his values.
