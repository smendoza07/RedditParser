    "body": "One of my ex-sugar babies was a struggling actress when I met her, now she blew the fuck up and I see her face on TV commercials and in movies.\n\nIt's kind of surreal but I'm really happy for her. She said she liked me at the time, then she ghosted as I assume her career took off. Even if she was just there for the sugar, I like to think it helped her chase and achieve her dreams. So I'm very happy for her!\n\nIt was fun while it lasted!",
