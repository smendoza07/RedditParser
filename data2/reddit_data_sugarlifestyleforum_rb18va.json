    "body": "I posted about a month ago that my SD was dying of cancer. Well he sadly passed away 2 weeks ago, unfortunately we never got to have a last conversation to say goodbye etc. His sister let me know of his passing and explained how he was in denial that he was at the end\n\nIt's his funeral tomorrow and obviously I am not going as he was married and it would look too suspicious. I discussed this with his sister and she thinks the same. I'm totally devastated, heartbroken and lost. People keep telling me to get on with things, and life goes on but right now it's seems impossible. I don't have motivation to do anything or enjoy anything. Please say a nice comment, I'm in need of them right now xx",

Perhaps again on his birthday or in a year\u2019s time. No one can take that away from you. Hopefully this will go some way to moving on.",

If the wife had any suspicion it would look odd.  She probably did vaguely know about you and had a don't ask/don't tell policy. I wouldn't want to taint her day, and it's sweet that you and the sister are in touch.  \n\n\nRegardless if you were in love, it's obvious you had a genuine connection and affection for each other.  Grieving a close friend who passed too soon is valid.  Personally, I honour my passed loved ones annually. I look forward to it, it's common in many cultures. Make their favourite meal, go to their favourite place, do something they'd approve of.  Write them a letter and burn it so it reaches them.  Even if you're more on the atheist side, his pain is gone now and it sounds like he had a lovely life with you in it.",

For anyone going through any type of loss (a death, a breakup, etc.), I can't recommend a book enough called \"How to Survive the Loss of a Love.\" It's hardly even a book as it's all bullet points and poems, but it is incredibly helpful in that it allows you to better understand what you're going through. Please read it for yourself! When you said \"people keep telling me to get on with things...\" that reminded me of a part of the book where it explains that grief is not linear and never has a set timeline. You are allowed to feel what you're feeling, and you shouldn't feel badly about it. Best of luck. This too shall pass.",

I agree with those who have said that you need to get some closure through a private viewing or graveside visit. I think that you are likely very young so you need to recognize that you have a lot of life ahead of you. You will learn to live with the loss and at some point the memories will slowly replace the emptiness. You owe it to him, but more importantly to yourself to make your relationship a part of your life experience and take the good from it to move forward towards more future success. It may help to join a grief counseling group or confide in a good friend. This is not going to be easy, but you will get through it and better days are ahead.",
