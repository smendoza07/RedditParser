    "body": "hey so i was meeting a POT SD just at the border of France and Belgium and at first we were just talking about a M&G and he would pay for the train and hotel etc.. all fine. \nthen he asked if i had a friend, so i told hem yes (me and a close friend sometimes go to M&G\u2019s together some guys are really into it) so he asked me is she younger then you? and i was like??? younger than me???? mind you im 18 ( turning 19 in 5 days) so i told him absolutely not and besides i dont know anyone who is underage. He apologised and told me it wasn\u2019t to have sex with her and we moved on, he also offered a crazy big amount for a platonic m&g and it felt really sketchy he offered to pay double the amount if i brought a underage girl anyway this morning i was suppose to see him  but i was like hell nah i blocked his ass real quick, think i really dodged a bullet, but THEN he texted me with a different number offering me triple the amount to come and 5 times the amount if i brought a younger friend..... i was curious so i asked him why are you so keen on me bringing a underage girl? and he told me he did not want to have sex wit her but he did want to kiss and touch her so i told him thats illegal and he responded with, it will be very discreet  nobody will know, i was shoooooook he even told me at one point cant you go to a high-school and look for some girl\nshould i go to the police? report him? i have all the texts and his name and number, the problem is im scared my mom is going to find out when i go to the police, but i dont want him to actually do this with underage girls",

I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay and hold on to ANY PHYSICAL PROOF that you have so you can show the cops or whoever. Make copies, take screenshots, and put/save them in multiple places. Email... separate thumb drive, google drive, whatever. Just MULTIPLE PLACES. I\u2019m so glad you questioned what was happening and that you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve been in almost an identical situation, I just wasn\u2019t asked to bring a younger friend. But the more I said no, the more the money went up. I immediately ejected myself from the situation, blocked him and reported him. Which brings me to my next question. Have you reported him to POF, and do you have any pictures that you can show to the police because people like this usually have more than one \u201cname\u201d or alias.",

(that can be legal money right?) \nanyway i just checked our convo and saw he deleted everything luckily i made a screen video of our whole convo. everything is kind of sinking in atm i need to be way more careful  with who i trust and meet. im still trying to figure out if i should go to the police because i have a feeling they wont take me serious and that they will look at me like this dirty whore. because the place where i live is really conservative. but its the right thing to do and i think i will go anyway. and btw im sorry but for what stands POF?",

I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay and hold on to ANY PHYSICAL PROOF that you have so you can show the cops or whoever. Make copies, take screenshots, and put/save them in multiple places. Email... separate thumb drive, google drive, whatever. Just MULTIPLE PLACES. I\u2019m so glad you questioned what was happening and that you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve been in almost an identical situation, I just wasn\u2019t asked to bring a younger friend. But the more I said no, the more the money went up. I immediately ejected myself from the situation, blocked him and reported him. Which brings me to my next question. Have you reported him to POF, and do you have any pictures that you can show to the police because people like this usually have more than one \u201cname\u201d or alias.",

(that can be legal money right?) \nanyway i just checked our convo and saw he deleted everything luckily i made a screen video of our whole convo. everything is kind of sinking in atm i need to be way more careful  with who i trust and meet. im still trying to figure out if i should go to the police because i have a feeling they wont take me serious and that they will look at me like this dirty whore. because the place where i live is really conservative. but its the right thing to do and i think i will go anyway. and btw im sorry but for what stands POF?",

Email... separate thumb drive, google drive, whatever. Just MULTIPLE PLACES. I\u2019m so glad you questioned what was happening and that you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve been in almost an identical situation, I just wasn\u2019t asked to bring a younger friend. But the more I said no, the more the money went up. I immediately ejected myself from the situation, blocked him and reported him. Which brings me to my next question. Have you reported him to POF, and do you have any pictures that you can show to the police because people like this usually have more than one \u201cname\u201d or alias.",

(that can be legal money right?) \nanyway i just checked our convo and saw he deleted everything luckily i made a screen video of our whole convo. everything is kind of sinking in atm i need to be way more careful  with who i trust and meet. im still trying to figure out if i should go to the police because i have a feeling they wont take me serious and that they will look at me like this dirty whore. because the place where i live is really conservative. but its the right thing to do and i think i will go anyway. and btw im sorry but for what stands POF?",

(that can be legal money right?) \nanyway i just checked our convo and saw he deleted everything luckily i made a screen video of our whole convo. everything is kind of sinking in atm i need to be way more careful  with who i trust and meet. im still trying to figure out if i should go to the police because i have a feeling they wont take me serious and that they will look at me like this dirty whore. because the place where i live is really conservative. but its the right thing to do and i think i will go anyway. and btw im sorry but for what stands POF?",
