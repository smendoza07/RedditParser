The hair you've collected along the way will be what's in the ponytail. Put that hair up in a ponytail and then brush down the hair not in it, done, takes about 10 seconds and it will look OK.\n\nTry it out.",

The hair you've collected along the way will be what's in the ponytail. Put that hair up in a ponytail and then brush down the hair not in it, done, takes about 10 seconds and it will look OK.\n\nTry it out.",
