    "body": "[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/lhw5z2/sb_might_be_hinting_that_she_wants_me_to_buy_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI got such good feedback on this post that I decided to do a follow-up.\n\nSo, I was wrong.  She wasn\u2019t hinting or expecting me to get her a car.  In fact, she had put down a deposit for a part to fix her existing car.  This was AFTER I told her over text that I wanted to discuss the car situation when we next got together.  \n\nWe were chatting and she asked me what I was thinking re her car.  So I went ahead and gave her all the reasons why I thought that we should get her a new car.  This was beyond cute, as it was like what I was offering wasn\u2019t sinking in.  She was just looking at me for a bit.  Then it all dawned on her, and she seemed completely shocked and blown away.  Then the excitement started kicking in.  The transition was fun to watch.  So now we are having fun talking about what she will get.  \n\nHer reaction makes me feel all the better since she had zero expectations that I was going to do this. I am convinced I am going the right thing. \n\nWe also exchanged cards for Valentines.  She places an extremely high value on the gesture of exchanging cards, because in her words, she treasures the written word.  She kept holding off on opening hers, and eventually told me that she was afraid to open in it, because she might start crying if she read it in front of me.  She eventually opened it and told me it was going in the box with all the other cards I have given her.  She even saves the notes from the flowers I would send her when she was living in a different city.  \n\nWith all of this, I am feeling pretty damn good right now.  Thanks to everyone who encouraged me to go ahead with the gift.",
