    "body": "I work at a relatively high end jewelry store. I greeted an old couple with their arms full of bags and immediately wanted them to adopt me. The gentleman, in his 80s, was very fun. His girlfriend, in her 60s, was looking at pieces and was not sure about spending the money. SD whips out his card and tells her to get whatever. She settled on a good sapphire ring and she said that would be her Christmas present. He said no, this is your Halloween present. He then had her try on other pieces, including a $16,000 ring. He said he\u2019d be back for it when she wasn\u2019t there. \n\nSo apparently they have been seeing each other for a few years and she doesn\u2019t want to get married, he said he\u2019s lucky enough that he scored a broad like her.  He said he\u2019s old so why not spoil a beautiful woman.\n\nI worked with them for over an hour and we had so much fun. They talked about their travels and things they like to do. When they were leaving, he said they were going to toast with some champagne.  He invited me to go with them because I\u2019m \u201ca keeper\u201d. \n\nAnyway, it made my whole day",
