                    "body": "The thing about Haha is that he usually betrays only when it's in his best interest and he's envisioned exactly how that betrayal will benefit him. But he will do it for even a small advantage, so it happens a lot! Because he's being honest the rest of the time (and acts no different either way), he seems much more rational and believable. I'm actually impressed at how much he still gets the other members to trust him.\n\nJihyo is much the same to a lesser degree (in her willingness to betray and the others' belief in her)--though one of her tells for being a spy/betrayer is when she acts like she doesn't understand the rules of the game. (Good luck telling that from when she _actually_ doesn't know the rules, though.)\n\nSomin, Jaesuk, and Sukjin are true tiger moths who betray just on the off chance that it might be advantageous to do so, but they don't really think of _how_ it will be advantageous. And it often backfires.\n\nSechan usually betrays because he thinks is funny to put certain members at a disadvantage, more than to help himself (though he's not bad at that, either). Anecdotally, it seems to me he likes to do this most to the members whose show characters are lower status (and maybe gullible), like Sukjin and Somin.\n\nKwangsoo betrayed mostly to bring chaos. The great thing was that, because he betrayed so much, nobody believed him at those times when he had the opportunity to betray, but didn't. In fact, I think he was suspected _more_ when he was being honest.\n\nJongkook trusts that he can win without betraying, but he's comfortable doing so when the rules of a game dictate that he pretty much has to betray--or at least will be given a significant advantage.",

            "body": "I regularly rewatch almost all of the episodes since YSC and JSM's arrival.    \nI put this chart together based largely on key betrayals and key signs of trust.  \n\nThe absolute, most untrustworthy member is Somin. Our departed Giraffe left her that position and she wears it well. Funnily enough, however, she can still be trusted more by the trustworthy members more than HaHa, who is actually one of the biggest traitors among the cast.  \n\nThe reason Somin is the most untrustworthy is her ability to betray anybody. HaHa betrays the members with extreme prejudice. However, he can oftentimes be counted on by guests. Somin and Sukjin are fair game when it comes to guests.  \n\nAnother noteworthy thing is how every member can trust JongKook at his word.    \nSomething else that's funny about JiHyo and Sechan is that they are actually pretty untrustworthy when they are not under the umbrella of JongKook's influence.  \n\nJaesuk is a middle-ground sort of traitor, as in he does betray the traitorous members of the show, but he often tries to not betray guests and trustworthy members such as JiHyo and JongKook. However, if he's with anybody who went to the Japanese Horror Maze, he will likely betray them. He will always betray Jessi and Somin.  \n\nSukJin was a close call with Somin, I might even say they are tied, but due to my lack of graphical prowess, he's just next to her. Guests and the cast are not safe when it comes to Sukjin. He plays the greedy old man character better than anybody and it's so surprising when any cast member trusts him for anything.",
