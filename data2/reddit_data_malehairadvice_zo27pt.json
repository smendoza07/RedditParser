I use it by itself when I am not going somewhere important or if it\u2019s a lazy day since it only gives a little bit of hold and definition.\n\nI use the curling cream as a pre-styler then I blow dry my hair. I think it works out fine for me because my hair is naturally voluminous and textured. I would suggest you use a different product depending on what you are looking to achieve with your hairstyle. I only like using curling cream because it\u2019s lightweight & it makes my hair feel really soft and healthy.\n\nI post-style with some hair paste after blow drying to create the definition and hold. Make sure you blow dry and use a product that holds if you want it to last all day.",

I think it works out fine for me because my hair is naturally voluminous and textured. I would suggest you use a different product depending on what you are looking to achieve with your hairstyle. I only like using curling cream because it\u2019s lightweight & it makes my hair feel really soft and healthy.\n\nI post-style with some hair paste after blow drying to create the definition and hold. Make sure you blow dry and use a product that holds if you want it to last all day.",

I use it by itself when I am not going somewhere important or if it\u2019s a lazy day since it only gives a little bit of hold and definition.\n\nI use the curling cream as a pre-styler then I blow dry my hair. I think it works out fine for me because my hair is naturally voluminous and textured. I would suggest you use a different product depending on what you are looking to achieve with your hairstyle. I only like using curling cream because it\u2019s lightweight & it makes my hair feel really soft and healthy.\n\nI post-style with some hair paste after blow drying to create the definition and hold. Make sure you blow dry and use a product that holds if you want it to last all day.",
