He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

And in this meme Sarada is saying she's been invited over to their house and Sasuke is appropriately horrified, given their history. That's the joke. Hope this helped.",

He owes him for not being called a criminal and being allowed to roam free despite his criminal background, for easing tensions between villages that may have been caused due to his actions, for reuniting him with Sakura and allowing him to have a daughter and a family but most importantly for bringing him back from the depths of darkness. I\u2019m sure Sasuke feels indebted to Naruto, a debt he doesn\u2019t know how to repay. So he takes Boruto under his wing and makes him pupil. Boruto admires Sasuke the most and so by training him Sasuke is trying to repay Naruto for everything he\u2019s ever done for him. \n\nAs for Orochimaru, he did say in the war arc that he has changed, that spending time inside kabuto made him realize that the goal he was chasing all along was flawed and conceited. We also don\u2019t know what he saw in his infinite tsukuyomi  dream. I like to think that whatever it was perhaps changed his outlook on life and shinobi. Maybe he saw his childhood alongside jiraiya, tsunade and Hiruzen. We know that he willingly surrendered to imprisonment after the war, and now under Naruto\u2019s (and Yamato\u2019s) surpervision he is detained in a hideout near the leaf. He even created mitsuki because he wanted mitsuki to do \u201cwhat he couldn\u2019t do, and become what he couldn\u2019t be.\u201d Perhaps he feels regret for all he\u2019s done in the past and something reestablished his will to protect the village again. No other hokage would let him live, but Naruto can because he believes in second chances, maybe he is grateful of that fact.",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

He owes him for not being called a criminal and being allowed to roam free despite his criminal background, for easing tensions between villages that may have been caused due to his actions, for reuniting him with Sakura and allowing him to have a daughter and a family but most importantly for bringing him back from the depths of darkness. I\u2019m sure Sasuke feels indebted to Naruto, a debt he doesn\u2019t know how to repay. So he takes Boruto under his wing and makes him pupil. Boruto admires Sasuke the most and so by training him Sasuke is trying to repay Naruto for everything he\u2019s ever done for him. \n\nAs for Orochimaru, he did say in the war arc that he has changed, that spending time inside kabuto made him realize that the goal he was chasing all along was flawed and conceited. We also don\u2019t know what he saw in his infinite tsukuyomi  dream. I like to think that whatever it was perhaps changed his outlook on life and shinobi. Maybe he saw his childhood alongside jiraiya, tsunade and Hiruzen. We know that he willingly surrendered to imprisonment after the war, and now under Naruto\u2019s (and Yamato\u2019s) surpervision he is detained in a hideout near the leaf. He even created mitsuki because he wanted mitsuki to do \u201cwhat he couldn\u2019t do, and become what he couldn\u2019t be.\u201d Perhaps he feels regret for all he\u2019s done in the past and something reestablished his will to protect the village again. No other hokage would let him live, but Naruto can because he believes in second chances, maybe he is grateful of that fact.",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",

He was world famous and they battled around a giant statue of him. Itachi telling Sasuke that Madara was his partner really hits hard though because of that.\n\nIn Boruto, Sakura is extremely vague to Sarada but then says to Sasuke she thought she explained everything to her when obviously that wasn't the case.\n\nSasuke doesn't come home for about 10 years, but once Sarada meets him, he comes home more often. He has a wormhole jutsu and could definitely learn Minato's teleportation jutsu so there's no reason he can't be home frequently.\n\nNaruto leaves a clone at the Hokage's office once to come home, but sends the clone home for Himawari's birthday.\n\nThe list goes on",
