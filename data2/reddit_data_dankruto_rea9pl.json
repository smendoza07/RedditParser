Even if you took those two out of the picture, there\u2019s no doubt they\u2019re still the strongest village by far and would win another Great Ninja War without Naruto and Sasuke. Choji can turn into a literal human meteor and just sit on top of another village and wipe it out. And if that\u2019s not enough, they can just pull a Madara and send in a second one since Choji\u2019s dad is still alive. And that\u2019s just Choji\u2019s clan, you still gotta worry about literally every insect you see ever because of Shino\u2019s clan. You can\u2019t even hide anywhere because of the Hyuga. You can\u2019t even pet a puppy anymore without fear of it trying to bite your hand off because of Kiba\u2019s clan. And if you somehow managed to form an air tight defense, Lee will literally just kick it down. Well at least you\u2019re safe in your mind right? Wrong. Ino\u2019s clan will possess your mind and make you text your ex that you miss them and the details to your bank account.",

He can just summon a giant sphere of water atop your village to drown everyone, and he can summon a swarm of sharks to take on anyone who tries to swim their way out. They also had the 7 swordsmen who managed to cut down scores of shinobi during the 4th Great Ninja War; some of them had decent jutsu as well. Plus they have Suigetsu's clan; they can literally hide in your water supply and come out of your faucet. And the Mizukage with her gas-based justu can just breathe on your village to melt through your walls, armor, and weapons. \n\nHidden Clouds have 2 jinchuriki, one of whom is the 8-tails. They have an absolute hoard of hidden techniques since they spend so much time stealing scrolls and jutsu from other villages. At one point their Raikage was more or less invincible; he single-handedly held back 10,000 enemy shinobi for three days before finally dying to what I assume was dehydration or something. They may not have super strong clans, but their top fighters were really top notch; and their jinchuriki were more skilled than any other village's.\n\nHidden sand kinda sucks I'll admit. They have a few puppet masters and some people with magnet release. And that's cool I guess, but aside from some of the Kazekage and Sasori, they don't really offer much.  Gaara is still awesome though. \n\nHidden Stone have 1) an explosives core, 2) airborne shinobi who can just straight up fly, 3) a literal death star in the from of the Tsuchikage, and 4) \"magma\" release to coat your forces in cement from above. It's true that their average fighters are pretty weak on the whole. But it's not an accident that Onoki has survived for so long. Minato took out a small army from the Stone, but only powerhouses like Minato really stood a chance against the well-organized Stone military. \n\nHidden Rain...exists I guess. Hanzo was strong once, but he became really weak over time. Aside from Konan and Nagato, they don't have much during the main story.  And those two are only strong because of 1) Jiraya's teaching and 2) a rinnegan implanted by Obito.",

But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka. After Naruto gets control of the 9-tails though, nothing from any other village is even touching him.",

Sasuke didn\u2019t have to worry about that, so he could probably spam more chidoris than Kakashi could. \n\nEnd of part 1 Kakashi is honestly probably on par with end of part 1 Sasuke. I think they both **might** have a chance at taking out Gaara when he\u2019s unstable, but it seems like Gaara got a bit of a boost once he was able to control both himself and Shukaku.",

The moment Naruto beat Haku was the moment I placed Tailless-Naruto above Jounin because, according to Zabuza himself, Haku >> Zabuza. This then scales Neji, Kimmimaru, and so on well past Jounin. Part 1 Kakashi, THE TOP Jounin who was also Jounin prior to receiving Sharingan, couldn't even keep up with Rock Lee without using his Sharingan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The series broke its scales very early in the series which is why we get stuff like War Arc Haku's speed, which is relative to tailless-Naruto, blitzing Sai, who was around or above pre-SM Kabuto's level. By pure powerscaling, it's debatable whether P1 Kakashi would beat VoTe Naruto and Sasuke. It is also probable that Gaara wins vs P1 Kakashi because Kimmimaru himself scales to around low-kage level (he fought KCM Naruto). It's just a question of how much distance begans between Gaara and Kakashi since we know Gaara could turn the entire area around him into a sinkhole that he controls.",

Jounin from the sand wouldn't even try to touch Gaara anyways, and his foes would probably face him together with Temari and Kankuro, who would probably have a coordenated attack. ALSO, they grew in a time of peace, so the shinobi they faced probably weren't the top shinobi from other villages, maybe some rouge ones.\n\nALSO, Gaara is a jinchuriki, so not much people would be strong enough to face him.

Konoha would clap the sand in just about every generation, they'd clap the rock, win against the mist mid to high diff depending on the age, and probably win against the cloud high diff. If it was when hashirama was around, Konoha would STOMP, hard.",

Choji can turn into a literal human meteor and just sit on top of another village and wipe it out. And if that\u2019s not enough, they can just pull a Madara and send in a second one since Choji\u2019s dad is still alive. And that\u2019s just Choji\u2019s clan, you still gotta worry about literally every insect you see ever because of Shino\u2019s clan. You can\u2019t even hide anywhere because of the Hyuga. You can\u2019t even pet a puppy anymore without fear of it trying to bite your hand off because of Kiba\u2019s clan. And if you somehow managed to form an air tight defense, Lee will literally just kick it down. Well at least you\u2019re safe in your mind right? Wrong.

They also had the 7 swordsmen who managed to cut down scores of shinobi during the 4th Great Ninja War; some of them had decent jutsu as well. Plus they have Suigetsu's clan; they can literally hide in your water supply and come out of your faucet. And the Mizukage with her gas-based justu can just breathe on your village to melt through your walls, armor, and weapons. \n\nHidden Clouds have 2 jinchuriki, one of whom is the 8-tails. They have an absolute hoard of hidden techniques since they spend so much time stealing scrolls and jutsu from other villages. At one point their Raikage was more or less invincible; he single-handedly held back 10,000 enemy shinobi for three days before finally dying to what I assume was dehydration or something. They may not have super strong clans, but their top fighters were really top notch; and their jinchuriki were more skilled than any other village's.\n\nHidden sand kinda sucks I'll admit. They have a few puppet masters and some people with magnet release. And that's cool I guess, but aside from some of the Kazekage and Sasori, they don't really offer much.  Gaara is still awesome though. \n\nHidden Stone have 1) an explosives core, 2) airborne shinobi who can just straight up fly, 3) a literal death star in the from of the Tsuchikage, and 4) \"magma\" release to coat your forces in cement from above. It's true that their average fighters are pretty weak on the whole. But it's not an accident that Onoki has survived for so long. Minato took out a small army from the Stone, but only powerhouses like Minato really stood a chance against the well-organized Stone military. \n\nHidden Rain...exists I guess. Hanzo was strong once, but he became really weak over time. Aside from Konan and Nagato, they don't have much during the main story.  And those two are only strong because of 1) Jiraya's teaching and 2) a rinnegan implanted by Obito.",

But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka. After Naruto gets control of the 9-tails though, nothing from any other village is even touching him.",

Based on all the other squad leaders, it should be easy enough to extrapolate that he is capable, plus he's regarded as one of the best trainers, which may not correlate with him being super powerful, but enough to hold his own against Gaara. Whether he has anything to hurt gaara, is another question, but he probably wouldn't be hurt by him. He was in Guy's squad back in the day, so I'd assume he's pretty capable in a fight.",

The moment Naruto beat Haku was the moment I placed Tailless-Naruto above Jounin because, according to Zabuza himself, Haku >> Zabuza. This then scales Neji, Kimmimaru, and so on well past Jounin. Part 1 Kakashi, THE TOP Jounin who was also Jounin prior to receiving Sharingan, couldn't even keep up with Rock Lee without using his Sharingan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The series broke its scales very early in the series which is why we get stuff like War Arc Haku's speed, which is relative to tailless-Naruto, blitzing Sai, who was around or above pre-SM Kabuto's level. By pure powerscaling, it's debatable whether P1 Kakashi would beat VoTe Naruto and Sasuke. It is also probable that Gaara wins vs P1 Kakashi because Kimmimaru himself scales to around low-kage level (he fought KCM Naruto). It's just a question of how much distance begans between Gaara and Kakashi since we know Gaara could turn the entire area around him into a sinkhole that he controls.",

He can just summon a giant sphere of water atop your village to drown everyone, and he can summon a swarm of sharks to take on anyone who tries to swim their way out. They also had the 7 swordsmen who managed to cut down scores of shinobi during the 4th Great Ninja War; some of them had decent jutsu as well. Plus they have Suigetsu's clan; they can literally hide in your water supply and come out of your faucet. And the Mizukage with her gas-based justu can just breathe on your village to melt through your walls, armor, and weapons. \n\nHidden Clouds have 2 jinchuriki, one of whom is the 8-tails. They have an absolute hoard of hidden techniques since they spend so much time stealing scrolls and jutsu from other villages. At one point their Raikage was more or less invincible; he single-handedly held back 10,000 enemy shinobi for three days before finally dying to what I assume was dehydration or something. They may not have super strong clans, but their top fighters were really top notch; and their jinchuriki were more skilled than any other village's.\n\nHidden sand kinda sucks I'll admit. They have a few puppet masters and some people with magnet release. And that's cool I guess, but aside from some of the Kazekage and Sasori, they don't really offer much.  Gaara is still awesome though. \n\nHidden Stone have 1) an explosives core, 2) airborne shinobi who can just straight up fly, 3) a literal death star in the from of the Tsuchikage, and 4) \"magma\" release to coat your forces in cement from above. It's true that their average fighters are pretty weak on the whole. But it's not an accident that Onoki has survived for so long. Minato took out a small army from the Stone, but only powerhouses like Minato really stood a chance against the well-organized Stone military. \n\nHidden Rain...exists I guess. Hanzo was strong once, but he became really weak over time. Aside from Konan and Nagato, they don't have much during the main story.  And those two are only strong because of 1) Jiraya's teaching and 2) a rinnegan implanted by Obito.",

But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka. After Naruto gets control of the 9-tails though, nothing from any other village is even touching him.",

The moment Naruto beat Haku was the moment I placed Tailless-Naruto above Jounin because, according to Zabuza himself, Haku >> Zabuza. This then scales Neji, Kimmimaru, and so on well past Jounin. Part 1 Kakashi, THE TOP Jounin who was also Jounin prior to receiving Sharingan, couldn't even keep up with Rock Lee without using his Sharingan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The series broke its scales very early in the series which is why we get stuff like War Arc Haku's speed, which is relative to tailless-Naruto, blitzing Sai, who was around or above pre-SM Kabuto's level. By pure powerscaling, it's debatable whether P1 Kakashi would beat VoTe Naruto and Sasuke. It is also probable that Gaara wins vs P1 Kakashi because Kimmimaru himself scales to around low-kage level (he fought KCM Naruto). It's just a question of how much distance begans between Gaara and Kakashi since we know Gaara could turn the entire area around him into a sinkhole that he controls.",

You can\u2019t even pet a puppy anymore without fear of it trying to bite your hand off because of Kiba\u2019s clan.

He can just summon a giant sphere of water atop your village to drown everyone, and he can summon a swarm of sharks to take on anyone who tries to swim their way out. They also had the 7 swordsmen who managed to cut down scores of shinobi during the 4th Great Ninja War; some of them had decent jutsu as well. Plus they have Suigetsu's clan; they can literally hide in your water supply and come out of your faucet. And the Mizukage with her gas-based justu can just breathe on your village to melt through your walls, armor, and weapons. \n\nHidden Clouds have 2 jinchuriki, one of whom is the 8-tails. They have an absolute hoard of hidden techniques since they spend so much time stealing scrolls and jutsu from other villages. At one point their Raikage was more or less invincible; he single-handedly held back 10,000 enemy shinobi for three days before finally dying to what I assume was dehydration or something. They may not have super strong clans, but their top fighters were really top notch; and their jinchuriki were more skilled than any other village's.\n\nHidden sand kinda sucks I'll admit. They have a few puppet masters and some people with magnet release. And that's cool I guess, but aside from some of the Kazekage and Sasori, they don't really offer much.  Gaara is still awesome though. \n\nHidden Stone have 1) an explosives core, 2) airborne shinobi who can just straight up fly, 3) a literal death star in the from of the Tsuchikage, and 4) \"magma\" release to coat your forces in cement from above. It's true that their average fighters are pretty weak on the whole. But it's not an accident that Onoki has survived for so long. Minato took out a small army from the Stone, but only powerhouses like Minato really stood a chance against the well-organized Stone military. \n\nHidden Rain...exists I guess. Hanzo was strong once, but he became really weak over time. Aside from Konan and Nagato, they don't have much during the main story.  And those two are only strong because of 1) Jiraya's teaching and 2) a rinnegan implanted by Obito.",

But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka. After Naruto gets control of the 9-tails though, nothing from any other village is even touching him.",

Sasuke didn\u2019t have to worry about that, so he could probably spam more chidoris than Kakashi could. \n\nEnd of part 1 Kakashi is honestly probably on par with end of part 1 Sasuke. I think they both **might** have a chance at taking out Gaara when he\u2019s unstable, but it seems like Gaara got a bit of a boost once he was able to control both himself and Shukaku.",

Part 1 Kakashi, THE TOP Jounin who was also Jounin prior to receiving Sharingan, couldn't even keep up with Rock Lee without using his Sharingan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The series broke its scales very early in the series which is why we get stuff like War Arc Haku's speed, which is relative to tailless-Naruto, blitzing Sai, who was around or above pre-SM Kabuto's level. By pure powerscaling, it's debatable whether P1 Kakashi would beat VoTe Naruto and Sasuke. It is also probable that Gaara wins vs P1 Kakashi because Kimmimaru himself scales to around low-kage level (he fought KCM Naruto). It's just a question of how much distance begans between Gaara and Kakashi since we know Gaara could turn the entire area around him into a sinkhole that he controls.",

            "body": "Leaf Village has some supremely strong powerhouses, but we shouldn't discount the strengths of the other villages. \n\nThe Hidden Mist had Kisame, who was nearly as strong as a perfect 8-tails Jinchuriki in combat. He can just summon a giant sphere of water atop your village to drown everyone, and he can summon a swarm of sharks to take on anyone who tries to swim their way out. They also had the 7 swordsmen who managed to cut down scores of shinobi during the 4th Great Ninja War; some of them had decent jutsu as well. Plus they have Suigetsu's clan; they can literally hide in your water supply and come out of your faucet. And the Mizukage with her gas-based justu can just breathe on your village to melt through your walls, armor, and weapons. \n\nHidden Clouds have 2 jinchuriki, one of whom is the 8-tails. They have an absolute hoard of hidden techniques since they spend so much time stealing scrolls and jutsu from other villages. At one point their Raikage was more or less invincible; he single-handedly held back 10,000 enemy shinobi for three days before finally dying to what I assume was dehydration or something. They may not have super strong clans, but their top fighters were really top notch; and their jinchuriki were more skilled than any other village's.\n\nHidden sand kinda sucks I'll admit. They have a few puppet masters and some people with magnet release. And that's cool I guess, but aside from some of the Kazekage and Sasori, they don't really offer much.  Gaara is still awesome though. \n\nHidden Stone have 1) an explosives core, 2) airborne shinobi who can just straight up fly, 3) a literal death star in the from of the Tsuchikage, and 4) \"magma\" release to coat your forces in cement from above. It's true that their average fighters are pretty weak on the whole. But it's not an accident that Onoki has survived for so long. Minato took out a small army from the Stone, but only powerhouses like Minato really stood a chance against the well-organized Stone military. \n\nHidden Rain...exists I guess. Hanzo was strong once, but he became really weak over time. Aside from Konan and Nagato, they don't have much during the main story.  And those two are only strong because of 1) Jiraya's teaching and 2) a rinnegan implanted by Obito.",

                            "body": "The list takes some liberties with the timelines just because I had to account for several characters who swapped teams or died. \n\nKisame worked with the Mist up until Obito revealed that he was controlling the 5th Mizukage, at which point Kisame started working directly for Obito.  But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka. After Naruto gets control of the 9-tails though, nothing from any other village is even touching him.",

Sasuke didn\u2019t have to worry about that, so he could probably spam more chidoris than Kakashi could. \n\nEnd of part 1 Kakashi is honestly probably on par with end of part 1 Sasuke. I think they both **might** have a chance at taking out Gaara when he\u2019s unstable, but it seems like Gaara got a bit of a boost once he was able to control both himself and Shukaku.",

But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka.

Sasuke didn\u2019t have to worry about that, so he could probably spam more chidoris than Kakashi could. \n\nEnd of part 1 Kakashi is honestly probably on par with end of part 1 Sasuke. I think they both **might** have a chance at taking out Gaara when he\u2019s unstable, but it seems like Gaara got a bit of a boost once he was able to control both himself and Shukaku.",

But for a while the Mist had Kisame as an asset. Likewise, Zazuba worked for the Mist up until he left with Haku; I just don't find either of them strong enough to really sway a war since they were taken out by pre-timeskip Team 7.\n\nHanzo was once an absolute monster. Dude took on Mifune easily, and he beat not only the Sanin but also all of the other shinobi who were fighting alongside them. But he became weak and paranoid with time. He wasn't able to do much of anything to quell the violence that Akatsuki (the original group founded by Yahiko) were trying to stop; he was easily tricked by Danzo into attacking his allies; and he got fairly quickly stomped by an inexperienced Pain. Might also be filler, but Mifune has a rematch with Hanzo in the 4th War in which even Hanzo admits he let himself become jaded and dull as he aged. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the Naruto front, but only for the versions of Naruto after the start of the 4th War. Pain arc Naruto was strong, but not strong enough to take on the top tier villages on his own. The 3rd Raikage could probably match or beat Pain-arc Naruto's speed; Onoki could disintegrate Pain-arc Naruto even if he turned into Kurama like he did against Pain; and Killer B could probably take Pain-arc Naruto considering he nearly beat Sasuke and the members of Taka. After Naruto gets control of the 9-tails though, nothing from any other village is even touching him.",
