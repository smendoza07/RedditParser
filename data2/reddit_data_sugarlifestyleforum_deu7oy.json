    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI was given motion picture money in lieu of an allowance. I won't really get into this but I'm creating this post as a warning to other girls out there - in my experience, scammers are rare but wow when it happens it feels so violating. I've never been given fake money before and I'm beyond pissed.\n\nSomeone seeming nice does not mean they won't scam you.  Getting along with someone does not mean they won't scam you. This guy and I talked for about 5 hours at dinner - I thought he was a good person. We had chemistry. We talked about things like traveling, volunteering, family, BEING SCAMMED ON SA lol. This evidently is not enough to be sure a person won't scam you.\n\nI know it's uncomfortable, but get the money as soon as you walk through the door of the house/hotel room/wherever the good stuff is going down - as soon as you climb in the back seat of the car, hey, I don't judge.  Get the money and CHECK IT. I never thought about this before. I heard people say to but I always dismissed it because I'm smart right? I thought I could detect a scammer but here I am with 600 in Hollywood money but no stores to spend it in.\n\nIf girls in LA/Orange County area want to private message me I can give you his details so you can avoid him to the best of your ability.\n\nStay safe out there everyone",

He gave me the gift, we spent some time together, then I went home.\nThe next morning, I got a call from police asking me to come down because this man had called them after I left and reported that I stole his money... they told me he was frantic and obviously distressed. \n\nTurns out the guy had blown his rent money on me, and was having buyers\u2019 remorse!\n\nI didn\u2019t want any trouble,  so I told the cops I would gladly give it back\u2026 No amount of money is worth all the stress.\n\nBut this cop was so cool\u2026 He said to me \u201cdid he ask you to spend the time with him?\u201d I said \u201cyes, absolutely... everything was agreed to beforehand\u201d... to which the cop replied, very adamantly and protectively of me \u201cYou earned that money\u2026 You\u2019re not giving it back\u201c!!!\n\nNever saw the guy again, but I can\u2019t imagine that the cops were very nice to him after that!!",

Once the money was spent with the intent to deceive someone it became counterfeit currency. If you find an idiot I go takes Monopoly money those bills are at that moment counterfeit. Intent is important. \n\nI used to working in the finance industry, st one point working as corporate compliance and security officer. The rules governing how currency can / can\u2019t be replicated is easily found:  \n\nhttps://www.uscurrency.gov/media/currency-image-use\n\nEven with these guidelines, if you use these guidelines to copy money and try to pass it as legal currency you are guilty of counterfeiting.",

I have personally spoken to law enforcement when this happened at the club I danced at. It was not considered a federal crime. The local officer physically had a secret service agent on the phone, who told him there was nothing the feds could do as it meets all the criteria to not be considered counterfeit. The cops took a report for theft of services of course they did nothing with it.",

Luckily my boss was a bro and didn't hold me responsible for the money that was basically \"missing\" from my till. Just roasted me and used it as an example of \"what not to do\" for the rest of my time there. But yeah, it's an easy mistake to make. You'll never take a bill without triple checking it again, but before it ever happens to you it's really easy to just be on autopilot and just \"stick money in the money spot\".\n\nSorry that happened though!

The local officer physically had a secret service agent on the phone, who told him there was nothing the feds could do as it meets all the criteria to not be considered counterfeit. The cops took a report for theft of services of course they did nothing with it.",

Their interest might partially depend on how realistic the fake money is, but OPs scammer clearly constitutes an investigative avenue for them.  They would likely be interested in the source of the bills (movie money is actually more tightly controlled than you think), and whether they have been used elsewhere.  For data and tracking purposes, it makes sense that you would want to get every sample of fake currency that you possibly can.\n\nThe Secret Service doesn't give a fuck about OP, and won't recover any money on her behalf.
