Overall it was possible for me to prove it by looking it up but at the time I was nodding off for early nap trying to clear some alerts that I knew would prevent me from relaxing. Depending on which sub I'm in and how critical of a topic it is I take the extra step of providing a link when replying or really just let the thread die off.\n\nSometimes in life we take shortcuts and regret it yet other times it helps us get on to more important tasks. It's times like this that I reflect on how many people I've upset, like yourself, here on r/dankruto for not providing a direct source. It's honestly embarrassing even having been called out once and likely many others have suffered in silence.

Obito's speed was also never greater than Kakashi's speed, and there are more more enough feats to prove this.\n\nKiddo kakashi himself believed that Obito's teleportation exceeded Minato's when he met him during Itachi pursuit arc.Ofcourse Minato proved to be faster than Obito during their encounter(nine tails incident) but that obito was only 13-14 years old plus he was also cocky at that time.Obito improved later and was much faster than before.The fact that Kakashi was overwhelmed by Obito's speed proves how obito was leagues above kakashi in terms of speed.Obito was nearly as fast as Minato( arguably fastest guy on Naruto).\n\n\n>If you actually pay attention to the fight, it's clear to see its very near enough but Kakashi definitively won at the end.\n\nHuh,lately Kakashi-tards are getting a lot similar to  Itachi-tards.\n\nSome people have already explained this in the comment section.Just look above.\n\n>\nEven if you say \"oh Kakashi didn't win because Obtio wanted to have a hand shoved through his chest\" that is not equal to \"Obito beat Kakashi\".

Even with Hashi cells, he's \"only\" around Kakashi level. While he needed the seal to be broken, he was fighting all out against kakashi and lost in theory.

How is that relevant ? Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

They will out last Jigen\u2019s chakra reserves and the dude will crack up, keep in mind that he lost to Koji, that\u2019s how much he was weakened. If Naruto kept fighting, he will have won against Jigen then and there.\n\n2- Jigen stated that it would take too much to kill a 9 tail jinchuuriki! Meanwhile in the war, Naruto has all 9 byju who actively participated in the fight against Kaguya. All 9 were there inside him boosting his chakra and stats! So imagine how much it would take to kill him lol\n\n3- the yin yang seal, lol with they they would seal his ass up.\n\n4- DMS kamui Kakashi with Rinnegan sasuke hax...

Sasuke is stronger and has better mastery of rinnegan, even if plot doesn't have him show it. We've seen both of them take on kage level threats with little to no effort. You brought up Shin, but neither of them were trying, they just wanted info on him. Even Sakura was winning until the weapon manipulation caught her by surprise and she got tagged, right before Sasuke showed up.",

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot.

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

I mean, with Kakashi not being able to use Sharingan effectively, it makes sense because he simply isn't an Uchiha, it'd be like having the wrong bloodtype I guess. \n\nBut Madara awakened Rinnegan because he had Hashirama's cells. Obito was HALF Hashirama AND Zetsu (also had some kind of extra power from the Gedo Statue or something?). So there was no reason for him to be \"incompatible\" with Madara's Rinnegan.\n\n(It made sense with Nagato because he was neither an Uchiha nor a Senju, but managed due to being an Uzumaki. With Obito though, I think they were really just... grasping at straws because they needed him nerfed. That's why it was such a lame excuse like \"oh they're Madara's eyes so they don't work as well on Obito\", even though there's a contradictory rule where, if you're an Uchiha and get someone else's MS like Sasuke with Itachi's, you actually unlock a stronger evolution of the Sharingan, the EMS.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant lol.",

Imagine just how much better the series could be if the industry didn't rush writers and all... sigh.\n\nAnd (just to put it out there lol) I had that thought too (Obito simply did not have experience), but I personally disagree because when Obito first approaches Nagato, he specifically says he will *TRAIN* Nagato to use the eyes and unlock their true power.\n\nSo we know Madara awakened them at a pretty old age, and secretly implanted the eyes into Nagato, who doesn't know how to use it (even after training with Jiraiya; we never see him as powerful as he was later or using Six Paths of Pain with Jiraiya). Hence Madara probably taught Obito everything he knew about the Rinnegan (from Uchiha tablets etc), and then presumably Obito had to do his own research + go through trial-and-error in training with Pain.\n\nIt was shown pretty clearly that around Yahiko's death, Pain couldn't do much with the eyes yet; BUT after meeting (and obviously training with) Obito, he was able to use the six Pains and overpower Hanzo & his entire forces (and even hunted down and annihilated all those who were loyal to Hanzo.)\n\nSo we can conclude that Obito DEFINITELY was the one who *trained him and helped him unlock the Six Paths of Pain* etc.\n\n...so, yeah, to me, the \"inexperienced\" excuse also makes no sense. :')",

No, he keeps a mini ten tails that gives him enough chakra to survive and keeps him ''strong''.\n\nFrom what I remember Isshiki had less than 24 hours to live, when did Madara or even Kaguya had this problem after getting the chakra fruit from the earth?\n\nDoes Isshiki the guy who got tricked by a shadow clone of a kid ''Kawaki'' has enough abilities to overpower Jubidara who showed the most hax abilities in the whole show?",

If he was Isshiki he doesn't even need that chakra. \n\nMadara and Kaguya had no time limit because they were alive not part dead like Isshiki. If Isshiki was alive he would live for Thousands of years just like Kaguya.\n\nThe reason he fell for the shadow clone trick was because he had about 5 seconds left at most to live. Kaguya got desperate when Naruto and Sasuke were about to seal her at that moment when she was gonna summon the all killing ash bone she got hit in the head by Sakura which distracted her and she got sealed. \n\nKaguya and Madara would have also had their life sucked if Naruto used Baryon mode on them and would have died if they were in the same situation as Isshiki. If Isshiki reincarnated in as perfect vessel he would have shit load of life and just like madara and Kaguya he couldn't have been killed, only way would be to seal him away.\n\nIdk how I am low balling Madara it's more like your in Denial. Try to understand New villains> old villains. That's how the show works it's not that Naruto and Sasuke got nerfed it's more that they can no longer keep up with the new villains most of their abilities are rendered useless against the villains so they can't utilise all of their abilities which checkmates them. It's simple try to understand it.",

I don't even watch Boruto and I know more than you do.\n\nThe manga is the main series, the anime adapts it.\n\n''Try to understand New villains> old villains'' This is a very dumb statement. Isshiki can only punch, shrink him self and shrink other objects, but he needs to see the object in order to shrink them.\n\nThis abilities he has are very weak, he can't even absorb chakra without a karma. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke got beaten up is because they were nerfed.\n\nI mean Kawaki managed to trick Isshiki with a shadow clone, while Naruto and Sasuke who are the strongest ninjas in the world right now couldn't trick him in any way?\n\nIts also very funny how Isshiki has not shown a single feat except beating the nerfed Naruto and Sasuke who didn't even use their full arsenal against him.\n\nDo you even know what feats Jubidara has?

Have you ever seen anyone say that Madara beat Hashirama in their last fight because he got the DNA he wanted? Objectively, he did win, but he undeniably lost the fight. Exact same scenario for Kakashi VS Obito. Kakashi defeated Obito, but this defeat worked just as well for Obito's plans anyway as his seal came undone.

How is that relevant ? Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

If Naruto kept fighting, he will have won against Jigen then and there.\n\n2- Jigen stated that it would take too much to kill a 9 tail jinchuuriki!

Sasuke is stronger and has better mastery of rinnegan, even if plot doesn't have him show it. We've seen both of them take on kage level threats with little to no effort.

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak.

They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

I mean, with Kakashi not being able to use Sharingan effectively, it makes sense because he simply isn't an Uchiha, it'd be like having the wrong bloodtype I guess. \n\nBut Madara awakened Rinnegan because he had Hashirama's cells. Obito was HALF Hashirama AND Zetsu (also had some kind of extra power from the Gedo Statue or something?). So there was no reason for him to be \"incompatible\" with Madara's Rinnegan.\n\n(It made sense with Nagato because he was neither an Uchiha nor a Senju, but managed due to being an Uzumaki. With Obito though, I think they were really just... grasping at straws because they needed him nerfed. That's why it was such a lame excuse like \"oh they're Madara's eyes so they don't work as well on Obito\", even though there's a contradictory rule where, if you're an Uchiha and get someone else's MS like Sasuke with Itachi's, you actually unlock a stronger evolution of the Sharingan, the EMS.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant lol.",

Imagine just how much better the series could be if the industry didn't rush writers and all... sigh.\n\nAnd (just to put it out there lol) I had that thought too (Obito simply did not have experience), but I personally disagree because when Obito first approaches Nagato, he specifically says he will *TRAIN* Nagato to use the eyes and unlock their true power.\n\nSo we know Madara awakened them at a pretty old age, and secretly implanted the eyes into Nagato, who doesn't know how to use it (even after training with Jiraiya; we never see him as powerful as he was later or using Six Paths of Pain with Jiraiya). Hence Madara probably taught Obito everything he knew about the Rinnegan (from Uchiha tablets etc), and then presumably Obito had to do his own research + go through trial-and-error in training with Pain.\n\nIt was shown pretty clearly that around Yahiko's death, Pain couldn't do much with the eyes yet; BUT after meeting (and obviously training with) Obito, he was able to use the six Pains and overpower Hanzo & his entire forces (and even hunted down and annihilated all those who were loyal to Hanzo.)\n\nSo we can conclude that Obito DEFINITELY was the one who *trained him and helped him unlock the Six Paths of Pain* etc.\n\n...so, yeah, to me, the \"inexperienced\" excuse also makes no sense. :')",

No, he keeps a mini ten tails that gives him enough chakra to survive and keeps him ''strong''.\n\nFrom what I remember Isshiki had less than 24 hours to live, when did Madara or even Kaguya had this problem after getting the chakra fruit from the earth?\n\nDoes Isshiki the guy who got tricked by a shadow clone of a kid ''Kawaki'' has enough abilities to overpower Jubidara who showed the most hax abilities in the whole show?",

If he was Isshiki he doesn't even need that chakra. \n\nMadara and Kaguya had no time limit because they were alive not part dead like Isshiki. If Isshiki was alive he would live for Thousands of years just like Kaguya.\n\nThe reason he fell for the shadow clone trick was because he had about 5 seconds left at most to live. Kaguya got desperate when Naruto and Sasuke were about to seal her at that moment when she was gonna summon the all killing ash bone she got hit in the head by Sakura which distracted her and she got sealed. \n\nKaguya and Madara would have also had their life sucked if Naruto used Baryon mode on them and would have died if they were in the same situation as Isshiki. If Isshiki reincarnated in as perfect vessel he would have shit load of life and just like madara and Kaguya he couldn't have been killed, only way would be to seal him away.\n\nIdk how I am low balling Madara it's more like your in Denial. Try to understand New villains> old villains. That's how the show works it's not that Naruto and Sasuke got nerfed it's more that they can no longer keep up with the new villains most of their abilities are rendered useless against the villains so they can't utilise all of their abilities which checkmates them.

Isshiki can only punch, shrink him self and shrink other objects, but he needs to see the object in order to shrink them.\n\nThis abilities he has are very weak, he can't even absorb chakra without a karma. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke got beaten up is because they were nerfed.\n\nI mean Kawaki managed to trick Isshiki with a shadow clone, while Naruto and Sasuke who are the strongest ninjas in the world right now couldn't trick him in any way?\n\nIts also very funny how Isshiki has not shown a single feat except beating the nerfed Naruto and Sasuke who didn't even use their full arsenal against him.\n\nDo you even know what feats Jubidara has?

Overall it was possible for me to prove it by looking it up but at the time I was nodding off for early nap trying to clear some alerts that I knew would prevent me from relaxing. Depending on which sub I'm in and how critical of a topic it is I take the extra step of providing a link when replying or really just let the thread die off.\n\nSometimes in life we take shortcuts and regret it yet other times it helps us get on to more important tasks. It's times like this that I reflect on how many people I've upset, like yourself, here on r/dankruto for not providing a direct source. It's honestly embarrassing even having been called out once and likely many others have suffered in silence.

Obito's speed was also never greater than Kakashi's speed, and there are more more enough feats to prove this.\n\nKiddo kakashi himself believed that Obito's teleportation exceeded Minato's when he met him during Itachi pursuit arc.Ofcourse Minato proved to be faster than Obito during their encounter(nine tails incident) but that obito was only 13-14 years old plus he was also cocky at that time.Obito improved later and was much faster than before.The fact that Kakashi was overwhelmed by Obito's speed proves how obito was leagues above kakashi in terms of speed.Obito was nearly as fast as Minato( arguably fastest guy on Naruto).\n\n\n>If you actually pay attention to the fight, it's clear to see its very near enough but Kakashi definitively won at the end.\n\nHuh,lately Kakashi-tards are getting a lot similar to  Itachi-tards.\n\nSome people have already explained this in the comment section.Just look above.\n\n>\nEven if you say \"oh Kakashi didn't win because Obtio wanted to have a hand shoved through his chest\" that is not equal to \"Obito beat Kakashi\".

It was never said or even implied that Obito held back, so saying he did hold back is just headcanon. \n\nBruh it was said by obito that he let kakashi win.Just watch it.\n\n>Whether you decide to think he is holding back or not, the point stands that Kakashi outdid him in that fight as a shinobi.\n\nI didn't decide or made this.These are facts bruh.Kakashi won because Obito wanted him to win the fight.",

Madara and Itachi are perfect as they both have good backstories and interesting personalities.In Hinata's case,she is nice but as a character she lacks much personality.It was nice to see a beautiful princess simping on the mc as the mc really deserved it but her whole character was based on her relation with the mc. She was one of those characters who were left unexplored.",

How is that relevant ? Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

If Naruto kept fighting, he will have won against Jigen then and there.\n\n2- Jigen stated that it would take too much to kill a 9 tail jinchuuriki! Meanwhile in the war, Naruto has all 9 byju who actively participated in the fight against Kaguya. All 9 were there inside him boosting his chakra and stats!

Sasuke is stronger and has better mastery of rinnegan, even if plot doesn't have him show it. We've seen both of them take on kage level threats with little to no effort.

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot.

They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat.

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

I mean, with Kakashi not being able to use Sharingan effectively, it makes sense because he simply isn't an Uchiha, it'd be like having the wrong bloodtype I guess. \n\nBut Madara awakened Rinnegan because he had Hashirama's cells. Obito was HALF Hashirama AND Zetsu (also had some kind of extra power from the Gedo Statue or something?). So there was no reason for him to be \"incompatible\" with Madara's Rinnegan.\n\n(It made sense with Nagato because he was neither an Uchiha nor a Senju, but managed due to being an Uzumaki. With Obito though, I think they were really just... grasping at straws because they needed him nerfed. That's why it was such a lame excuse like \"oh they're Madara's eyes so they don't work as well on Obito\", even though there's a contradictory rule where, if you're an Uchiha and get someone else's MS like Sasuke with Itachi's, you actually unlock a stronger evolution of the Sharingan, the EMS.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant lol.",

However, I will try not to think of them because I really don't need to add to the rage I have at Naruto's canon and reasonings.\n\nJust going to add my two cents in:\nI always thought the reason Obito didn't use all of the Rinnegan abilities was because he didn't have time to train with it. He just semi-recently obtained it so he couldn't use it as fluidly as Kamui.",

Imagine just how much better the series could be if the industry didn't rush writers and all... sigh.\n\nAnd (just to put it out there lol) I had that thought too (Obito simply did not have experience), but I personally disagree because when Obito first approaches Nagato, he specifically says he will *TRAIN* Nagato to use the eyes and unlock their true power.\n\nSo we know Madara awakened them at a pretty old age, and secretly implanted the eyes into Nagato, who doesn't know how to use it (even after training with Jiraiya; we never see him as powerful as he was later or using Six Paths of Pain with Jiraiya). Hence Madara probably taught Obito everything he knew about the Rinnegan (from Uchiha tablets etc), and then presumably Obito had to do his own research + go through trial-and-error in training with Pain.\n\nIt was shown pretty clearly that around Yahiko's death, Pain couldn't do much with the eyes yet; BUT after meeting (and obviously training with) Obito, he was able to use the six Pains and overpower Hanzo & his entire forces (and even hunted down and annihilated all those who were loyal to Hanzo.)\n\nSo we can conclude that Obito DEFINITELY was the one who *trained him and helped him unlock the Six Paths of Pain* etc.\n\n...so, yeah, to me, the \"inexperienced\" excuse also makes no sense. :')",

If Isshiki was alive he would live for Thousands of years just like Kaguya.\n\nThe reason he fell for the shadow clone trick was because he had about 5 seconds left at most to live. Kaguya got desperate when Naruto and Sasuke were about to seal her at that moment when she was gonna summon the all killing ash bone she got hit in the head by Sakura which distracted her and she got sealed. \n\nKaguya and Madara would have also had their life sucked if Naruto used Baryon mode on them and would have died if they were in the same situation as Isshiki. If Isshiki reincarnated in as perfect vessel he would have shit load of life and just like madara and Kaguya he couldn't have been killed, only way would be to seal him away.\n\nIdk how I am low balling Madara it's more like your in Denial.

That's how the show works it's not that Naruto and Sasuke got nerfed it's more that they can no longer keep up with the new villains most of their abilities are rendered useless against the villains so they can't utilise all of their abilities which checkmates them.

Isshiki can only punch, shrink him self and shrink other objects, but he needs to see the object in order to shrink them.\n\nThis abilities he has are very weak, he can't even absorb chakra without a karma. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke got beaten up is because they were nerfed.\n\nI mean Kawaki managed to trick Isshiki with a shadow clone, while Naruto and Sasuke who are the strongest ninjas in the world right now couldn't trick him in any way?\n\nIts also very funny how Isshiki has not shown a single feat except beating the nerfed Naruto and Sasuke who didn't even use their full arsenal against him.\n\nDo you even know what feats Jubidara has?

That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

They will out last Jigen\u2019s chakra reserves and the dude will crack up, keep in mind that he lost to Koji, that\u2019s how much he was weakened. If Naruto kept fighting, he will have won against Jigen then and there.\n\n2- Jigen stated that it would take too much to kill a 9 tail jinchuuriki! Meanwhile in the war, Naruto has all 9 byju who actively participated in the fight against Kaguya. All 9 were there inside him boosting his chakra and stats! So imagine how much it would take to kill him lol\n\n3- the yin yang seal, lol with they they would seal his ass up.\n\n4- DMS kamui Kakashi with Rinnegan sasuke hax... Jigen would get so annoyed and frustrated lol",

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

He surpassed Minato\u2019 s speed as the raikage stated himself and then he got faster and stronger since then.\n\nThis is absolutely RIDICULOUS! It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak. In anime, usually the teen age is the strongest and most potent which is why most Shonen MCs reach their peak dream status by that age and deteriorate after.",

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

I mean, with Kakashi not being able to use Sharingan effectively, it makes sense because he simply isn't an Uchiha, it'd be like having the wrong bloodtype I guess. \n\nBut Madara awakened Rinnegan because he had Hashirama's cells. Obito was HALF Hashirama AND Zetsu (also had some kind of extra power from the Gedo Statue or something?). So there was no reason for him to be \"incompatible\" with Madara's Rinnegan.\n\n(It made sense with Nagato because he was neither an Uchiha nor a Senju, but managed due to being an Uzumaki. With Obito though, I think they were really just... grasping at straws because they needed him nerfed. That's why it was such a lame excuse like \"oh they're Madara's eyes so they don't work as well on Obito\", even though there's a contradictory rule where, if you're an Uchiha and get someone else's MS like Sasuke with Itachi's, you actually unlock a stronger evolution of the Sharingan, the EMS.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant lol.",

He just semi-recently obtained it so he couldn't use it as fluidly as Kamui.",

Imagine just how much better the series could be if the industry didn't rush writers and all... sigh.\n\nAnd (just to put it out there lol) I had that thought too (Obito simply did not have experience), but I personally disagree because when Obito first approaches Nagato, he specifically says he will *TRAIN* Nagato to use the eyes and unlock their true power.\n\nSo we know Madara awakened them at a pretty old age, and secretly implanted the eyes into Nagato, who doesn't know how to use it (even after training with Jiraiya; we never see him as powerful as he was later or using Six Paths of Pain with Jiraiya). Hence Madara probably taught Obito everything he knew about the Rinnegan (from Uchiha tablets etc), and then presumably Obito had to do his own research + go through trial-and-error in training with Pain.\n\nIt was shown pretty clearly that around Yahiko's death, Pain couldn't do much with the eyes yet; BUT after meeting (and obviously training with) Obito, he was able to use the six Pains and overpower Hanzo & his entire forces (and even hunted down and annihilated all those who were loyal to Hanzo.)\n\nSo we can conclude that Obito DEFINITELY was the one who *trained him and helped him unlock the Six Paths of Pain* etc.\n\n...so, yeah, to me, the \"inexperienced\" excuse also makes no sense. :')",

Have you ever seen anyone say that Madara beat Hashirama in their last fight because he got the DNA he wanted? Objectively, he did win, but he undeniably lost the fight. Exact same scenario for Kakashi VS Obito. Kakashi defeated Obito, but this defeat worked just as well for Obito's plans anyway as his seal came undone.

Obito's speed was also never greater than Kakashi's speed, and there are more more enough feats to prove this.\n\nKiddo kakashi himself believed that Obito's teleportation exceeded Minato's when he met him during Itachi pursuit arc.Ofcourse Minato proved to be faster than Obito during their encounter(nine tails incident) but that obito was only 13-14 years old plus he was also cocky at that time.Obito improved later and was much faster than before.The fact that Kakashi was overwhelmed by Obito's speed proves how obito was leagues above kakashi in terms of speed.Obito was nearly as fast as Minato( arguably fastest guy on Naruto).\n\n\n>If you actually pay attention to the fight, it's clear to see its very near enough but Kakashi definitively won at the end.\n\nHuh,lately Kakashi-tards are getting a lot similar to  Itachi-tards.\n\nSome people have already explained this in the comment section.Just look above.\n\n>\nEven if you say \"oh Kakashi didn't win because Obtio wanted to have a hand shoved through his chest\" that is not equal to \"Obito beat Kakashi\".

Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

They will out last Jigen\u2019s chakra reserves and the dude will crack up, keep in mind that he lost to Koji, that\u2019s how much he was weakened. If Naruto kept fighting, he will have won against Jigen then and there.\n\n2- Jigen stated that it would take too much to kill a 9 tail jinchuuriki! Meanwhile in the war, Naruto has all 9 byju who actively participated in the fight against Kaguya. All 9 were there inside him boosting his chakra and stats! So imagine how much it would take to kill him lol\n\n3- the yin yang seal, lol with they they would seal his ass up.\n\n4- DMS kamui Kakashi with Rinnegan sasuke hax... Jigen would get so annoyed and frustrated lol",

Sasuke is stronger and has better mastery of rinnegan, even if plot doesn't have him show it. We've seen both of them take on kage level threats with little to no effort. You brought up Shin, but neither of them were trying, they just wanted info on him.

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

He learnt nothing new!\n\nWhy the hell does he need to teleport when he\u2019s faster than minato!? He surpassed minato\u2019s speed even back with the raikage.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that he dodged the fang of light. So don\u2019t say stuff like he reacted to madara. That makes no sense. Regardless of who he reacts to, he has to be speed of light or above to dodge light! \n\nLightning is very close to speed of light, and he surpassed lightning way back with the raikage lol",

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

However, I will try not to think of them because I really don't need to add to the rage I have at Naruto's canon and reasonings.\n\nJust going to add my two cents in:\nI always thought the reason Obito didn't use all of the Rinnegan abilities was because he didn't have time to train with it. He just semi-recently obtained it so he couldn't use it as fluidly as Kamui.",

Imagine just how much better the series could be if the industry didn't rush writers and all... sigh.\n\nAnd (just to put it out there lol) I had that thought too (Obito simply did not have experience), but I personally disagree because when Obito first approaches Nagato, he specifically says he will *TRAIN* Nagato to use the eyes and unlock their true power.\n\nSo we know Madara awakened them at a pretty old age, and secretly implanted the eyes into Nagato, who doesn't know how to use it (even after training with Jiraiya; we never see him as powerful as he was later or using Six Paths of Pain with Jiraiya). Hence Madara probably taught Obito everything he knew about the Rinnegan (from Uchiha tablets etc), and then presumably Obito had to do his own research + go through trial-and-error in training with Pain.\n\nIt was shown pretty clearly that around Yahiko's death, Pain couldn't do much with the eyes yet; BUT after meeting (and obviously training with) Obito, he was able to use the six Pains and overpower Hanzo & his entire forces (and even hunted down and annihilated all those who were loyal to Hanzo.)\n\nSo we can conclude that Obito DEFINITELY was the one who *trained him and helped him unlock the Six Paths of Pain* etc.\n\n...so, yeah, to me, the \"inexperienced\" excuse also makes no sense. :')",

Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

Naruto reacted to Madara, not the light itself. FTL travel doesn't exist outside of teleportation jutsu, and if you have proof other than light fang that it does, let me know.",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Imagine just how much better the series could be if the industry didn't rush writers and all... sigh.\n\nAnd (just to put it out there lol) I had that thought too (Obito simply did not have experience), but I personally disagree because when Obito first approaches Nagato, he specifically says he will *TRAIN* Nagato to use the eyes and unlock their true power.\n\nSo we know Madara awakened them at a pretty old age, and secretly implanted the eyes into Nagato, who doesn't know how to use it (even after training with Jiraiya; we never see him as powerful as he was later or using Six Paths of Pain with Jiraiya). Hence Madara probably taught Obito everything he knew about the Rinnegan (from Uchiha tablets etc), and then presumably Obito had to do his own research + go through trial-and-error in training with Pain.\n\nIt was shown pretty clearly that around Yahiko's death, Pain couldn't do much with the eyes yet; BUT after meeting (and obviously training with) Obito, he was able to use the six Pains and overpower Hanzo & his entire forces (and even hunted down and annihilated all those who were loyal to Hanzo.)\n\nSo we can conclude that Obito DEFINITELY was the one who *trained him and helped him unlock the Six Paths of Pain* etc.\n\n...so, yeah, to me, the \"inexperienced\" excuse also makes no sense. :')",

Overall it was possible for me to prove it by looking it up but at the time I was nodding off for early nap trying to clear some alerts that I knew would prevent me from relaxing. Depending on which sub I'm in and how critical of a topic it is I take the extra step of providing a link when replying or really just let the thread die off.\n\nSometimes in life we take shortcuts and regret it yet other times it helps us get on to more important tasks. It's times like this that I reflect on how many people I've upset, like yourself, here on r/dankruto for not providing a direct source. It's honestly embarrassing even having been called out once and likely many others have suffered in silence. Heading out for the night knowing I only had the time to reply to you and describe the depth of how much I care and aim to improve to meet your expectation of me. \n\n\\*Commits soduko\\*",

Obito's speed was also never greater than Kakashi's speed, and there are more more enough feats to prove this.\n\nKiddo kakashi himself believed that Obito's teleportation exceeded Minato's when he met him during Itachi pursuit arc.Ofcourse Minato proved to be faster than Obito during their encounter(nine tails incident) but that obito was only 13-14 years old plus he was also cocky at that time.Obito improved later and was much faster than before.The fact that Kakashi was overwhelmed by Obito's speed proves how obito was leagues above kakashi in terms of speed.Obito was nearly as fast as Minato( arguably fastest guy on Naruto).\n\n\n>If you actually pay attention to the fight, it's clear to see its very near enough but Kakashi definitively won at the end.\n\nHuh,lately Kakashi-tards are getting a lot similar to  Itachi-tards.\n\nSome people have already explained this in the comment section.Just look above.\n\n>\nEven if you say \"oh Kakashi didn't win because Obtio wanted to have a hand shoved through his chest\" that is not equal to \"Obito beat Kakashi\".

Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

Sasuke is stronger and has better mastery of rinnegan, even if plot doesn't have him show it. We've seen both of them take on kage level threats with little to no effort. You brought up Shin, but neither of them were trying, they just wanted info on him. Even Sakura was winning until the weapon manipulation caught her by surprise and she got tagged, right before Sasuke showed up.",

Faster than Raikage, but he isn't literally going the speed of lightning. The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too!

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

Overall it was possible for me to prove it by looking it up but at the time I was nodding off for early nap trying to clear some alerts that I knew would prevent me from relaxing. Depending on which sub I'm in and how critical of a topic it is I take the extra step of providing a link when replying or really just let the thread die off.\n\nSometimes in life we take shortcuts and regret it yet other times it helps us get on to more important tasks. It's times like this that I reflect on how many people I've upset, like yourself, here on r/dankruto for not providing a direct source. It's honestly embarrassing even having been called out once and likely many others have suffered in silence. Heading out for the night knowing I only had the time to reply to you and describe the depth of how much I care and aim to improve to meet your expectation of me. \n\n\\*Commits soduko\\*",

Obito's speed was also never greater than Kakashi's speed, and there are more more enough feats to prove this.\n\nKiddo kakashi himself believed that Obito's teleportation exceeded Minato's when he met him during Itachi pursuit arc.Ofcourse Minato proved to be faster than Obito during their encounter(nine tails incident) but that obito was only 13-14 years old plus he was also cocky at that time.Obito improved later and was much faster than before.The fact that Kakashi was overwhelmed by Obito's speed proves how obito was leagues above kakashi in terms of speed.Obito was nearly as fast as Minato( arguably fastest guy on Naruto).\n\n\n>If you actually pay attention to the fight, it's clear to see its very near enough but Kakashi definitively won at the end.\n\nHuh,lately Kakashi-tards are getting a lot similar to  Itachi-tards.\n\nSome people have already explained this in the comment section.Just look above.\n\n>\nEven if you say \"oh Kakashi didn't win because Obtio wanted to have a hand shoved through his chest\" that is not equal to \"Obito beat Kakashi\".

Zetau mentioned Kakashi and Rin are trouble. hence why Obito went there in the first place, to save them.\n\n> Weirdly Obito recalled Rin several times including in his final moments, it's not like he did it for someone who would appear in his mind at that critical moment\n\nYeah it certainly was weird, why would Kakashi and Minato also be on he's dream like illusion. Why would he imagine himselfs as hokage ? That studd is crap, Obito is a simp, praise the lord Itachi\n\nWhat did i just say? did you even read my comment or are you perhaps have gone blind by your biased toxicity?. He literally was done with this world, nothing ever did matter to him anymore. Both the so called fastest shinboi alive, and the genius jonin at eight, failed to save their comrade, a little girl. \n\n> Obito, Madar and Nagato are the trio of villains who fucked up the world more than they imagined it fucked up, these characters who caused so much mess just because they couldn't succeed in life and didn't want others to succeed because of that\n\nAll of them had he's own ideals and view on peace. They weren't your average 2D me want powah. Me kill people anime villain. The world broke them. Nagato didn't went apeshit with Akatsuki just bcuz Yahiko died. He had one mission, to bring peace to the world, by reminding them the casualty of war and destruction. Same wise Obito wanted a world without any war and conflict, somewhat similar how Madara wanted a world without chakra to begin with.",

Naruto and Sasuke in Boruto are the strongest shinobi to exist outside So6P. Isshiki is the strongest enemy that has been introduced in all of Naruto, and the 2 strongest shinobi got absolutely bodied to the point where kurama had to give his life to even get close to a stalemate.\n\nNaruto is smarter, stronger, and has baryon. Sasuke is stronger and has better mastery of rinnegan, even if plot doesn't have him show it. We've seen both of them take on kage level threats with little to no effort. You brought up Shin, but neither of them were trying, they just wanted info on him. Even Sakura was winning until the weapon manipulation caught her by surprise and she got tagged, right before Sasuke showed up.",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too!

They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Obito's speed was also never greater than Kakashi's speed, and there are more more enough feats to prove this.\n\nKiddo kakashi himself believed that Obito's teleportation exceeded Minato's when he met him during Itachi pursuit arc.Ofcourse Minato proved to be faster than Obito during their encounter(nine tails incident) but that obito was only 13-14 years old plus he was also cocky at that time.Obito improved later and was much faster than before.The fact that Kakashi was overwhelmed by Obito's speed proves how obito was leagues above kakashi in terms of speed.Obito was nearly as fast as Minato( arguably fastest guy on Naruto).\n\n\n>If you actually pay attention to the fight, it's clear to see its very near enough but Kakashi definitively won at the end.\n\nHuh,lately Kakashi-tards are getting a lot similar to  Itachi-tards.\n\nSome people have already explained this in the comment section.Just look above.\n\n>\nEven if you say \"oh Kakashi didn't win because Obtio wanted to have a hand shoved through his chest\" that is not equal to \"Obito beat Kakashi\". It is very far from it. You may as well be saying final valley Madara beat final valley Hashirama.\n\nYou are not making any sense bruh.Obito was holding back in his fight with kakashi.What more explanation do you want.",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

It was never said or even implied that Obito held back, so saying he did hold back is just headcanon. \n\nBruh it was said by obito that he let kakashi win.Just watch it.\n\n>Whether you decide to think he is holding back or not, the point stands that Kakashi outdid him in that fight as a shinobi.\n\nI didn't decide or made this.These are facts bruh.Kakashi won because Obito wanted him to win the fight.",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too!

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Actually observe what they are doing. In what way is Obito holding back? Does he have some megazord hidden somewhere that he is deciding not to use? He clearly got outwitted. It was never said or even implied that Obito held back, so saying he did hold back is just headcanon.\n\nAre you not getting what \"holding back\"means,clearly you should watch the fight properly.Also the fight was planned by obito for him to rid of madara's seal.Just like how Itachi vs Sasuke was planned by Itachi.\n\n>He clearly got outwitted. It was never said or even implied that Obito held back, so saying he did hold back is just headcanon. \n\nBruh it was said by obito that he let kakashi win.Just watch it.\n\n>Whether you decide to think he is holding back or not, the point stands that Kakashi outdid him in that fight as a shinobi.\n\nI didn't decide or made this.These are facts bruh.Kakashi won because Obito wanted him to win the fight.",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot.

He learnt nothing new!\n\nWhy the hell does he need to teleport when he\u2019s faster than minato!? He surpassed minato\u2019s speed even back with the raikage.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that he dodged the fang of light. So don\u2019t say stuff like he reacted to madara. That makes no sense. Regardless of who he reacts to, he has to be speed of light or above to dodge light! \n\nLightning is very close to speed of light, and he surpassed lightning way back with the raikage lol",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki!

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot.

He learnt nothing new!\n\nWhy the hell does he need to teleport when he\u2019s faster than minato!? He surpassed minato\u2019s speed even back with the raikage.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that he dodged the fang of light. So don\u2019t say stuff like he reacted to madara. That makes no sense. Regardless of who he reacts to, he has to be speed of light or above to dodge light! \n\nLightning is very close to speed of light, and he surpassed lightning way back with the raikage lol",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak. In anime, usually the teen age is the strongest and most potent which is why most Shonen MCs reach their peak dream status by that age and deteriorate after.",

Naruto reacted to Madara, not the light itself. FTL travel doesn't exist outside of teleportation jutsu, and if you have proof other than light fang that it does, let me know.",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

He surpassed Minato\u2019 s speed as the raikage stated himself and then he got faster and stronger since then.\n\nThis is absolutely RIDICULOUS! It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak. In anime, usually the teen age is the strongest and most potent which is why most Shonen MCs reach their peak dream status by that age and deteriorate after.",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat.

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak. In anime, usually the teen age is the strongest and most potent which is why most Shonen MCs reach their peak dream status by that age and deteriorate after.",

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

The only FTL speed is Minato's teleportation.\nYou bring up Madara's fang of light, as most uninformed arguments usually do, but he didn't dodge the light itself. If I see you about to pull a gun and shoot, I can still theoretically dodge out of the way, despite being slower than a bullet. The light itself is limited to the speed in which Madara moves his head, which Naruto was able to keep in front of. His anticipation/reaction speed is quick, but he doesn't move light speed because that's ridiculous, and not possible in Naruto without teleportation (yet, anyway). \n\nKurama said Naruto was rusty in the way that friends tease each other. And while he hasn't been fighting a war, Naruto's Chakra pool is higher as he was still a teenager at the time of the war, with Chakra pools growing as you age up until you are fully mature (post-puberty). Plus Naruto has mastered all Chakra natures, learned way more jutsu, has a hashi arm that he can use, and Kurama learned Baryon.\n\nPeak Naruto and Sasuke are probably in their early-mid 20's, as Naruto wasn't hokage yet, and Sasuke continued to travel around. By the time of Boruto, they may be rusty, but only compared to their previous fighting form, which would be greater than war arc, because that's just how it goes when you continue to use your skills.",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak. In anime, usually the teen age is the strongest and most potent which is why most Shonen MCs reach their peak dream status by that age and deteriorate after.",

You see, one of their biggest abilities was their ability to instantly adapt and have zenkai boosts as per their enemy\u2019s power. Almost like dragon ball. They have sage mode, they have 6 path powers etc. and you can\u2019t just keep saying he will shrink dodge etc etc cause Kaguya could do all that too and more and yet they ganged up on her. \n\nThey were extremely witty and had insane stamina to fight nonstop for DAYS! One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

It\u2019s stated that they are rusty since the shin arc. \n\nSix path Naruto can use all natures, it was back in shippuden itself he can use all kekke genkai given by the byju back then too! He DIDNT learn a single new jutsu. Can you name one?! Kurama didn\u2019t \u2018learn\u2019 baryon mode, it\u2019s just a fusion concept that he made up on the spot. Even Naruto had no idea of such a thing.\n\nNo that\u2019s not how it goes. 15 years of peace is a LONG time to grow soft and weak. In anime, usually the teen age is the strongest and most potent which is why most Shonen MCs reach their peak dream status by that age and deteriorate after.",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat.

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

He surpassed minato\u2019s speed even back with the raikage.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that he dodged the fang of light. So don\u2019t say stuff like he reacted to madara. That makes no sense. Regardless of who he reacts to, he has to be speed of light or above to dodge light! \n\nLightning is very close to speed of light, and he surpassed lightning way back with the raikage lol",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy.

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it!

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat.

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

You do realize that only reason she avoided a close combat fight and kept her distance was cause of the fact that they had the yin yang seal in their palms and all it would take is a TOUCH to invoke it! Right?!\n\nIf they still had that yin yang seal in Boruto, even Jigen/ Isshiki wouldn\u2019t dare go fight them hand to hand close range so casually! A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

A touch by both of them is enough!\n\nThey would\u2019ve sealed Momoshiki in a minute with that seal lol \n\nAnd after she took sasuke to another dimension, she fought off Naruto\u2019s dimension filling clones like crazy. Swatting them like flies and combining ash bones into her combat. And keep in mind that these clones each were strong enough to brawl with limbo Juubidara and she swatted away 1000s of them like flies",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",

One new enemy after the other. Let me remind you. Naruto after breaking out of turtle island, sent clones all over the battle field and took out zetsu, and the edo kage! Then fought Obito and the Byju and the edo jinchuuriki! Then fought the 10 tails, then fought Juubito, then fought juubidara, then fought Kaguya and THEN fought Eachother and THEN still had enough chakra to undo the Infinite tsukiyomi!",

Since this happened during their fight it cleary means its kaguyas fair victory.  \nShe killed him before she got chakra fruit and tentails.  \nIsshiki had no chakra left to plant the karma, which hints he used it against kaguya in a fight.  \nHe also has terrible body time limit, hence Kawaki destroyed him, while Kaguya is immortal and stopped endless wars and fought her sons months\n\nand you think kaguya didn't have any fighting experience?  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10lJmz0Kevals2oPT32Nr0B1GQKUpEI69/view",
