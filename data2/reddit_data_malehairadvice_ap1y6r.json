Next, the back and sides should be scissor-cut short. For styling, go for a basic sea salt spray and then blow dry if you don\u2019t have a bit of natural waviness in your hair. If you do have the wave, sea salt spray isn\u2019t necessarily needed, but I\u2019d advise it anyway just for solidarity. Then all you gotta do is play around with the parting and boom. ",

You can rinse your hair with water daily, just make sure the water in your area is not hard water, if it hard, buy yourself a britta pitcher and just rinse your hair with it after shower so the hard water doesn't dry with your hair. \n\nAlso, another tip: change out your pillowcase every time you wash your hair, you don't want all that oil on your hair to be on your face and cause break out.\n\nEdit: I too used to have long straight Asian hair, now I don't even need to add any product to my hair to style it.",

My routine includes using Nizoral for my hair for 10 minutes,  then quick conditioner twice a week. If you're just starting this, your first few weeks are going to be greasy. Give it time for your scalp to adjust, you could start washing your hair every other day and slowly down to twice a week. Sometimes if I don't have time and my hair is really greasy and itchy, then I would use the conditioner for that day. People in Nopoos sub have other good advices too. Some of them don't even wash their hair with harsh chemical but only use home remedies that does the trick too. I know my friend only wash his hair once a month. ",

My routine includes using Nizoral for my hair for 10 minutes,  then quick conditioner twice a week. If you're just starting this, your first few weeks are going to be greasy. Give it time for your scalp to adjust, you could start washing your hair every other day and slowly down to twice a week. Sometimes if I don't have time and my hair is really greasy and itchy, then I would use the conditioner for that day. People in Nopoos sub have other good advices too. Some of them don't even wash their hair with harsh chemical but only use home remedies that does the trick too. I know my friend only wash his hair once a month. ",
