My current barbers a great guy who gets paid to teach and cut at events/conventions (not sure on the details tbh) and has done a fantastic job on any style ive tried since. His instagram shows a lot of interesting cuts hes done, i know a few peoplr who go tonhim and always had great hair and he was at a shop id already liked while i was trying people out.     \n     \nNot sure why you seem annoyed about something that had literally 0 mention in my comments. Using the proper terms wont help if your barber doesnt know them, or cant execute them well or consistently.

My current barbers a great guy who gets paid to teach and cut at events/conventions (not sure on the details tbh) and has done a fantastic job on any style ive tried since. His instagram shows a lot of interesting cuts hes done, i know a few peoplr who go tonhim and always had great hair and he was at a shop id already liked while i was trying people out.     \n     \nNot sure why you seem annoyed about something that had literally 0 mention in my comments. Using the proper terms wont help if your barber doesnt know them, or cant execute them well or consistently. Me knowing the difference between a crew cut or a buzz cut doesnt matter because I dont want either and Im not cutting anyone elses hair.",

It's the way our hair grows due to how thick the strands are, our's grow perpendicular to our scalp (it grows out) while caucasian hair grows down parallel to theirs. That's why when we get a 0.5 or 1 fade, our scalps shows much more.",

My current barbers a great guy who gets paid to teach and cut at events/conventions (not sure on the details tbh) and has done a fantastic job on any style ive tried since. His instagram shows a lot of interesting cuts hes done, i know a few peoplr who go tonhim and always had great hair and he was at a shop id already liked while i was trying people out.     \n     \nNot sure why you seem annoyed about something that had literally 0 mention in my comments. Using the proper terms wont help if your barber doesnt know them, or cant execute them well or consistently.

It's the way our hair grows due to how thick the strands are, our's grow perpendicular to our scalp (it grows out) while caucasian hair grows down parallel to theirs. That's why when we get a 0.5 or 1 fade, our scalps shows much more.",

My current barbers a great guy who gets paid to teach and cut at events/conventions (not sure on the details tbh) and has done a fantastic job on any style ive tried since. His instagram shows a lot of interesting cuts hes done, i know a few peoplr who go tonhim and always had great hair and he was at a shop id already liked while i was trying people out.     \n     \nNot sure why you seem annoyed about something that had literally 0 mention in my comments. Using the proper terms wont help if your barber doesnt know them, or cant execute them well or consistently. Me knowing the difference between a crew cut or a buzz cut doesnt matter because I dont want either and Im not cutting anyone elses hair.",
