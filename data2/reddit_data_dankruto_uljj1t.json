Kakashi moves at the speed of lightning when using Raikiri, but we are still able to perceive his movements. It's slowed down for the audience to be able to keep up with it. One time this didn't happen was when we actually saw Kakashi doing hand signs and it's completely impossible to tell what signs he was making because it was so fast",

Kakashi moves at the speed of lightning when using Raikiri, but we are still able to perceive his movements. It's slowed down for the audience to be able to keep up with it. One time this didn't happen was when we actually saw Kakashi doing hand signs and it's completely impossible to tell what signs he was making because it was so fast",

Kakashi moves at the speed of lightning when using Raikiri, but we are still able to perceive his movements. It's slowed down for the audience to be able to keep up with it. One time this didn't happen was when we actually saw Kakashi doing hand signs and it's completely impossible to tell what signs he was making because it was so fast",
