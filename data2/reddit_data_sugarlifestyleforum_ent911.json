    "body": "Nothing is ever easy, sugar relationships included. Yes, we all hear the words spoken on SLF: sugar should be effortless and easy. No fights, no missed dates, no time where things are not absolutely awesome. But let\u2019s be real, unless we are all walking robots this isn\u2019t possible in any relationship. \n\n If, as an SB, you find yourself doing a multitude of things you don\u2019t want to do, you find yourself unhappy some of the time, or you are choking down spicy lamb meat as a spice intolerant gal, I\u2019d go out on a limb to say you aren\u2019t in a mutually beneficial *sugar relationship*.\n\nIf, as an SD, you find yourself struggling to hold a conversation with your partner, are dealing with multiple cancelled dates, or are watching your SB text for hours with their friends while sitting across from you, I\u2019d also say you aren\u2019t in a mutually beneficial *sugar relationship*. \n\nYes, we all know that every sugar relationship includes sex. Any healthy relationship, for that matter, includes sex. If you\u2019re thinking about the queen of England every time you have sex (unless, of course, the queen of England does it for you) I would strongly suggest you stop reading right now. Because I\u2019m writing this post with the expectation that you all are out there getting your freaky on and enjoying the fuck out of it. \n\nYes, we all know that every sugar relationship includes money too. Whether it\u2019s exchanged in cash or whether it\u2019s exchanged in experiences, every relationship includes some form of monetary support. \n\nSex and Money are just one aspect of a multi-faceted sugar *relationship*. They are the soil upon which you build a foundation for a mutually beneficial relationship. Sure, if you don\u2019t want to build a foundation you can opt to roll around in the mud for awhile, but in the end, for this to be a *relationship* you\u2019ll need to put in a little elbow grease to build that foundation to support the walls and roof. \n\nMy SD and I have disagreements sometimes. He\u2019s a poor communicator and I\u2019m an emotional wreck at times. When he\u2019s dealing with something internally he clams up and when I\u2019m dealing with something I tend to smother someone. We don\u2019t always want to talk about exactly what is bothering us. This happens in relationships of all kinds, but especially in sugar ones because they are supposed to be *easy*. \n\nWhy do we feel that sugar relationships are so short lived? Because many of us don\u2019t put in the work to build the foundation for a lasting relationship because we\u2019re too afraid to tell someone what we need or want.\n\nI see people post here all the time about how their partner wants them to do something they don\u2019t want to do. So why do they do it? Because they don\u2019t feel they have enough of a voice in the relationship to communicate how they feel without getting left in the dust. And sure, if you spend the majority of your relationship just rolling in the mud, I\u2019d imagine you probably don\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on when it comes to speaking up. But for everyone else? Communicate heartily and often. \n\nUnfortunately voicing ones desires in an SR is the trickiest mountain to climb. How do we tell our partner we don\u2019t want to do that thing they want? How do we communicate that we\u2019re feeling less-so without seeming drama filled or a Debbie Downer? \n\nMy guy and I recently had a disagreement. The details are irrelevant but I started to feel as if he wasn\u2019t paying attention to me. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on why or how, just that it was. Of course, I felt stupid bringing this up and he might well have his own stuff he was dealing with. So I kept it locked away until one day he tried to discuss something and I just cracked. There was tears and snot and a stony silence drive home. Nearing his drop off point the SD looks over and says: \u2018Your gas tank is low. Pull in here so I can fill it.\u2019 \n\nWe\u2019re in the middle of a rough patch and he wants to fill my gas tank. We could very well never see each other again and he\u2019s thinking about the fact that I\u2019ll have to stop on the way home and he\u2019d rather do it for me now, spend a few extra minutes with me, instead of run-fleeing from the car because I\u2019m upset. Even if I\u2019m angry he wants to help. \n\nAnd so, we came up with the term: My Love Tank is Low. \n\nWhen one of us states our love tank is low the other is to show extra affection and attention without requiring or pressing to know what is really wrong or requiring something in return. Sometimes we do not want to talk about it, or sometimes we cannot articulate it. Sometimes we just don\u2019t want to shatter the illusion of the SR that is supposed to be perfect. Sometimes we just need a little extra love.\n\nMutually beneficial relationships aren\u2019t exchanging money for sex. It\u2019s about communicating with your partner about what is beneficial to you at that moment. Maybe that means you don\u2019t eat spicy lamb meat, or maybe that means you refuse to see the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, or maybe that means you just show a little extra love when someone is feeling down. \n\nMy partner and I are nearing five months. We aren\u2019t perfect, but I can tell you we are as perfectly happy as the day we first met. And that\u2019s because we communicate with each other. Or, sometimes, we just cuddle it out. \n\nYes, sometimes, some people just aren\u2019t meant to be. If you can\u2019t come to an agreement then by all means move on. But why do we let otherwise good SR\u2019s go sour over something that can be prevented? \n\nWhatever your thing is, communicate it. It\u2019s okay to have needs. Put your baggage out there if you want, or just tell someone you\u2019re feeling out of sorts. Suggest a different date if you don\u2019t want to attend that nightclub. Build the foundation for a lasting mutually beneficial relationship. And fill up your partners love tank if it\u2019s low.",

Well we do ok. But I have seen the normal age gaps tend to be 20, 30, 40 years. Second is marital status of the SD. It\u2019s no secret that 70 - 80% of SDs are married and would rather not put much emotional investment in an SR. Third, SBs are looking at SR as a gig and not a romantic relationship. For romance there is tinder and vanilla. Sugar is just something where you put up an act and pretend to like a guy 30 years your senior. \n\nThese are just a few big ones. There are many more and hence perfection is not an expectation.",
