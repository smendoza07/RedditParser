Also, Rock Lee didn't have to deal with nearly as much prejudice, nor did he live all alone for the better part of a decade.\nSo, I think the themes are important, but it wasn't the main focus. It was mostly on the characters and somewhat on the plot, and I think the themes of the series were not as important as some seem to think.\nStories are a mixture of things, and you can change the prevalence of certain ingredients to make it taste the way you prefer.",

That would have represented something very powerfull, that no matter how much you train, you cannot touch an uchiha, and then, having him defeated. \n\nThroughout the story, we se that uchihas have their powers gifted to them, naruto being the antithesis to that would be really powerful.\n\nThe ultimate outcast, not only he is the jinchuriki of the nine tails, an orphar, everyone hates him, but he cannot perform jutsu as well (maybe as a consequence of the seal) , that would have made him the ultimate outsider of the shinobi world, with an outide perspective, and thus, the only one fit to change it, without any weird prophecy or reincarnation, but with sheer will, as it should be.",

At the same time Asura, Hashirama, and Naruto never wanted conflict they wanted to end it. If destiny wins out in the end then sure Indras side will always win out. In my opinion I think Naruto was fated to go on that path but that's just my opinion I didnt write the story. Remember Hashirama won his battle with Madara but didnt change him. Naruto took it a step further and changed Sasuke",

Also, Rock Lee didn't have to deal with nearly as much prejudice, nor did he live all alone for the better part of a decade.\nSo, I think the themes are important, but it wasn't the main focus. It was mostly on the characters and somewhat on the plot, and I think the themes of the series were not as important as some seem to think.\nStories are a mixture of things, and you can change the prevalence of certain ingredients to make it taste the way you prefer.",

That would have represented something very powerfull, that no matter how much you train, you cannot touch an uchiha, and then, having him defeated. \n\nThroughout the story, we se that uchihas have their powers gifted to them, naruto being the antithesis to that would be really powerful.\n\nThe ultimate outcast, not only he is the jinchuriki of the nine tails, an orphar, everyone hates him, but he cannot perform jutsu as well (maybe as a consequence of the seal) , that would have made him the ultimate outsider of the shinobi world, with an outide perspective, and thus, the only one fit to change it, without any weird prophecy or reincarnation, but with sheer will, as it should be.",

In my opinion I think Naruto was fated to go on that path but that's just my opinion I didnt write the story. Remember Hashirama won his battle with Madara but didnt change him. Naruto took it a step further and changed Sasuke",

Also, Rock Lee didn't have to deal with nearly as much prejudice, nor did he live all alone for the better part of a decade.\nSo, I think the themes are important, but it wasn't the main focus. It was mostly on the characters and somewhat on the plot, and I think the themes of the series were not as important as some seem to think.\nStories are a mixture of things, and you can change the prevalence of certain ingredients to make it taste the way you prefer.",
