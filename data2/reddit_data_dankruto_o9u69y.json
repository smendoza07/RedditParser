Still absolutely terrible but at least Gaara knows where he stands with people. \n\nIf he wanted Gaara dead, it wouldn't have been that hard. Fuck, throw him into the ocean ffs. Like, be all, \"Hey Gaara, your mission is to go kill these people who called you a little bitch and they're at this island\" half way to the \"\"island\"\" drop his ass over the side. Like, have the boat set to explode or whatever. \n\nHiruzen though? Just as bad. This dude mentally manipulated this kid and specifically made him an outcast. People say it was for his protection when they have the best of the best in the shinobi world between enemies and Naruto. Hiruzen is one of my favorite characters cause he's such a shady bitch who could have shown the village that Naruto was just a kid. Shit, you saying they could protect Sasuke from all the people who wanted his genetics, but not Naruto? Slap both of them in the same place and give them a guard. Just saying Naruto is a real Uzumaki is enough of a reason to protect him as they're a dying breed. Just say Kushina got with a Yamanaka whoever. There's a million ideas out there than Hiruzen, the professor, just didn't care to entertain. \n\nMy favorite theory is that Hiruzen blames Naruto for Biwako's death. At least in the anime timeline.",

The ones that did the most for the village also seemed to do the worst stuff for the village as well.\n\nHashi kinda don\u2019t count, since he basically established peace out of war and spent a bunch of time having to time up the loose ends. Of course he wasn\u2019t going to be perfect because of that. He also created the village system.\n\nThe 2nd seemed shady af, but at the same time, I\u2019m pretty sure he was scarred af about another potential Madara.\n\nHonestly though, the potential rise of a second Madara I think motivated the behaviors of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd greatly. Ignoring the mythical figures (Kaguya and her clan, SoSP, etc.) and Naruto/Sasuke, Madara was the second strongest ninja ever. He would\u2019ve crushed anybody besides Hashi. He was also motivated to conquer and destroy the leaf, and those desires are a part of his clan. I can see why the 2nd and 3rd wanted to nip that stuff before they had to deal with a ninja that could solo everyone at once.\n\nThe 3rd could have been better in his 2nd term, but I also think by that point he was worn out and his hope for a better world was jaded after Minato\u2019s death.\n\nMinato seemed cool. Tsunade also seemed cool, if weaker than the others (but credit to her for handling Pain how she did). \n\nI don\u2019t know about Kakashi, and I don\u2019t count Naruto since he\u2019s always had Plot-no-Jutsu to be the best at everything ever.",

Kakashi (era of peace and massive development due largely to his input as Hokage, Konoha economy went stonks as soon as he took office)\n2. Minato (no wars while he was top dog, kept the whole village perfectly protected single handily, was the only Hokage we know that kept on top and *ahead* of desk work)\n3. Naruto \n4. Tobirama (Great advances to the village, academy was built under his jurisdiction, he did a lot of other good things. But he outcast the Uchiha due to fear which only made things worse. He made the Chunin exams, a trial in which kids kill other kids, which is the EXACT opposite of what Hashirama and Madara created the Hidden leaf for.)\n5. Hashirama (He started the village, very important, probably did a lot of building with wood style I guess. But he gave nuclear bombs to all the enemy villages. What the fuck man.)\n6. Tsunade (gambling issues, village got blasted because she couldn\u2019t protect it. I understand it\u2019s not her fault and she saved a lot of lives, but she failed as Hokage and admitted so herself)\n7. Hiruzen ( i could write pages on how bad this guy was as Hokage)",

Pain has like a negative chance of beating Hashi.\n\n2nd:\n\n* I'd say 55/45 split with Tobirama as the favorite. He's a Senju from the strongest era besides the mythic era (Kaguya, SoSP, etc), and he cut his teeth fighting Madara and Izuna. The 2nd invented flying thunder god, but I'm not sure if he was as talented in it as Minato. \n*  Pain was the strongest character in OG Naruto, but I also feel like he wasn't as battle tested. He was just overwhelmingly stronger than everyone else, so I don't think he really ever got challenged or learned how to fight tactically (especially since he could revive himself, he never learned how to think defensively). The 2nd was battle-tested against the greatest of the Uchiha's, I feel like that gives him the extra edge over Pain. The 2nd had a great tactical mind, and I could see him figuring out the shared bodies, and the revival ability. If he could use his flying thunder god like Minato, then Pain has an uphill battle.\n\n3rd:\n\n* I just don't see how the 3rd beats Pain. Even not being old, I just don't see the 3rd handling the 4 offensive bodies at once.\n\n4th:\n\n* Pretty sure he wins easily. His yellow flash technique I think outpaces Pain's ability to respond, and even if he responds I think there's no way Pain can touch him. Eventually even if Pain holds for awhile, he still falls because there's not much of an answer he would have against the speed and tactical genius of Minato.\n\n5th:\n\n* We know how that turned out\n\n6th:\n\n* I mean Kakashi loses, but if we're talking peak Kakashi with the Susanoo, then Pain probably loses?\n\n7th:\n\n* Stomps. Looking at just Hokage Naruto, Pain obviously loses the worst here. A fully controlled Kyuubi form + a yellow flash form + sage mode form + SoSP form. He downright beats the hell out of pain without breaking a sweat. \n\nSo\n\n6th < 5th < 3rd < Pain =< 2nd =< 4th <<<<<< 1st <<<<<<<<<<<<<< 7th",

Still absolutely terrible but at least Gaara knows where he stands with people. \n\nIf he wanted Gaara dead, it wouldn't have been that hard. Fuck, throw him into the ocean ffs. Like, be all, \"Hey Gaara, your mission is to go kill these people who called you a little bitch and they're at this island\" half way to the \"\"island\"\" drop his ass over the side. Like, have the boat set to explode or whatever. \n\nHiruzen though? Just as bad. This dude mentally manipulated this kid and specifically made him an outcast. People say it was for his protection when they have the best of the best in the shinobi world between enemies and Naruto. Hiruzen is one of my favorite characters cause he's such a shady bitch who could have shown the village that Naruto was just a kid. Shit, you saying they could protect Sasuke from all the people who wanted his genetics, but not Naruto? Slap both of them in the same place and give them a guard. Just saying Naruto is a real Uzumaki is enough of a reason to protect him as they're a dying breed. Just say Kushina got with a Yamanaka whoever. There's a million ideas out there than Hiruzen, the professor, just didn't care to entertain. \n\nMy favorite theory is that Hiruzen blames Naruto for Biwako's death. At least in the anime timeline.",

The ones that did the most for the village also seemed to do the worst stuff for the village as well.\n\nHashi kinda don\u2019t count, since he basically established peace out of war and spent a bunch of time having to time up the loose ends. Of course he wasn\u2019t going to be perfect because of that. He also created the village system.\n\nThe 2nd seemed shady af, but at the same time, I\u2019m pretty sure he was scarred af about another potential Madara.\n\nHonestly though, the potential rise of a second Madara I think motivated the behaviors of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd greatly. Ignoring the mythical figures (Kaguya and her clan, SoSP, etc.) and Naruto/Sasuke, Madara was the second strongest ninja ever. He would\u2019ve crushed anybody besides Hashi. He was also motivated to conquer and destroy the leaf, and those desires are a part of his clan. I can see why the 2nd and 3rd wanted to nip that stuff before they had to deal with a ninja that could solo everyone at once.\n\nThe 3rd could have been better in his 2nd term, but I also think by that point he was worn out and his hope for a better world was jaded after Minato\u2019s death.\n\nMinato seemed cool. Tsunade also seemed cool, if weaker than the others (but credit to her for handling Pain how she did). \n\nI don\u2019t know about Kakashi, and I don\u2019t count Naruto since he\u2019s always had Plot-no-Jutsu to be the best at everything ever.",

He made the Chunin exams, a trial in which kids kill other kids, which is the EXACT opposite of what Hashirama and Madara created the Hidden leaf for.)\n5. Hashirama (He started the village, very important, probably did a lot of building with wood style I guess. But he gave nuclear bombs to all the enemy villages. What the fuck man.)\n6.

Pain has like a negative chance of beating Hashi.\n\n2nd:\n\n* I'd say 55/45 split with Tobirama as the favorite. He's a Senju from the strongest era besides the mythic era (Kaguya, SoSP, etc), and he cut his teeth fighting Madara and Izuna. The 2nd invented flying thunder god, but I'm not sure if he was as talented in it as Minato. \n*  Pain was the strongest character in OG Naruto, but I also feel like he wasn't as battle tested. He was just overwhelmingly stronger than everyone else, so I don't think he really ever got challenged or learned how to fight tactically (especially since he could revive himself, he never learned how to think defensively). The 2nd was battle-tested against the greatest of the Uchiha's, I feel like that gives him the extra edge over Pain. The 2nd had a great tactical mind, and I could see him figuring out the shared bodies, and the revival ability. If he could use his flying thunder god like Minato, then Pain has an uphill battle.\n\n3rd:\n\n* I just don't see how the 3rd beats Pain. Even not being old, I just don't see the 3rd handling the 4 offensive bodies at once.\n\n4th:\n\n* Pretty sure he wins easily. His yellow flash technique I think outpaces Pain's ability to respond, and even if he responds I think there's no way Pain can touch him. Eventually even if Pain holds for awhile, he still falls because there's not much of an answer he would have against the speed and tactical genius of Minato.\n\n5th:\n\n* We know how that turned out\n\n6th:\n\n* I mean Kakashi loses, but if we're talking peak Kakashi with the Susanoo, then Pain probably loses?\n\n7th:\n\n* Stomps. Looking at just Hokage Naruto, Pain obviously loses the worst here. A fully controlled Kyuubi form + a yellow flash form + sage mode form + SoSP form. He downright beats the hell out of pain without breaking a sweat. \n\nSo\n\n6th < 5th < 3rd < Pain =< 2nd =< 4th <<<<<< 1st <<<<<<<<<<<<<< 7th",

I think he had a general idea of where the plot was going as far as the Akatsuki trying to make the 10 tails, and maybe Tobi as Obito; but I\u2019m pretty sure he only had a rough idea of where the series was going after the Pain fight when he was writing part one.

Still absolutely terrible but at least Gaara knows where he stands with people. \n\nIf he wanted Gaara dead, it wouldn't have been that hard. Fuck, throw him into the ocean ffs. Like, be all, \"Hey Gaara, your mission is to go kill these people who called you a little bitch and they're at this island\" half way to the \"\"island\"\" drop his ass over the side. Like, have the boat set to explode or whatever. \n\nHiruzen though? Just as bad. This dude mentally manipulated this kid and specifically made him an outcast. People say it was for his protection when they have the best of the best in the shinobi world between enemies and Naruto. Hiruzen is one of my favorite characters cause he's such a shady bitch who could have shown the village that Naruto was just a kid. Shit, you saying they could protect Sasuke from all the people who wanted his genetics, but not Naruto? Slap both of them in the same place and give them a guard. Just saying Naruto is a real Uzumaki is enough of a reason to protect him as they're a dying breed. Just say Kushina got with a Yamanaka whoever. There's a million ideas out there than Hiruzen, the professor, just didn't care to entertain. \n\nMy favorite theory is that Hiruzen blames Naruto for Biwako's death. At least in the anime timeline.",

He made the Chunin exams, a trial in which kids kill other kids, which is the EXACT opposite of what Hashirama and Madara created the Hidden leaf for.)\n5. Hashirama (He started the village, very important, probably did a lot of building with wood style I guess. But he gave nuclear bombs to all the enemy villages. What the fuck man.)\n6. Tsunade (gambling issues, village got blasted because she couldn\u2019t protect it. I understand it\u2019s not her fault and she saved a lot of lives, but she failed as Hokage and admitted so herself)\n7. Hiruzen ( i could write pages on how bad this guy was as Hokage)",

He's a Senju from the strongest era besides the mythic era (Kaguya, SoSP, etc), and he cut his teeth fighting Madara and Izuna. The 2nd invented flying thunder god, but I'm not sure if he was as talented in it as Minato. \n*  Pain was the strongest character in OG Naruto, but I also feel like he wasn't as battle tested. He was just overwhelmingly stronger than everyone else, so I don't think he really ever got challenged or learned how to fight tactically (especially since he could revive himself, he never learned how to think defensively). The 2nd was battle-tested against the greatest of the Uchiha's, I feel like that gives him the extra edge over Pain. The 2nd had a great tactical mind, and I could see him figuring out the shared bodies, and the revival ability. If he could use his flying thunder god like Minato, then Pain has an uphill battle.\n\n3rd:\n\n* I just don't see how the 3rd beats Pain. Even not being old, I just don't see the 3rd handling the 4 offensive bodies at once.\n\n4th:\n\n* Pretty sure he wins easily. His yellow flash technique I think outpaces Pain's ability to respond, and even if he responds I think there's no way Pain can touch him. Eventually even if Pain holds for awhile, he still falls because there's not much of an answer he would have against the speed and tactical genius of Minato.\n\n5th:\n\n* We know how that turned out\n\n6th:\n\n* I mean Kakashi loses, but if we're talking peak Kakashi with the Susanoo, then Pain probably loses?\n\n7th:\n\n* Stomps. Looking at just Hokage Naruto, Pain obviously loses the worst here. A fully controlled Kyuubi form + a yellow flash form + sage mode form + SoSP form. He downright beats the hell out of pain without breaking a sweat. \n\nSo\n\n6th < 5th < 3rd < Pain =< 2nd =< 4th <<<<<< 1st <<<<<<<<<<<<<< 7th",

He's a Senju from the strongest era besides the mythic era (Kaguya, SoSP, etc), and he cut his teeth fighting Madara and Izuna. The 2nd invented flying thunder god, but I'm not sure if he was as talented in it as Minato. \n*  Pain was the strongest character in OG Naruto, but I also feel like he wasn't as battle tested. He was just overwhelmingly stronger than everyone else, so I don't think he really ever got challenged or learned how to fight tactically (especially since he could revive himself, he never learned how to think defensively). The 2nd was battle-tested against the greatest of the Uchiha's, I feel like that gives him the extra edge over Pain. The 2nd had a great tactical mind, and I could see him figuring out the shared bodies, and the revival ability. If he could use his flying thunder god like Minato, then Pain has an uphill battle.\n\n3rd:\n\n* I just don't see how the 3rd beats Pain. Even not being old, I just don't see the 3rd handling the 4 offensive bodies at once.\n\n4th:\n\n* Pretty sure he wins easily. His yellow flash technique I think outpaces Pain's ability to respond, and even if he responds I think there's no way Pain can touch him. Eventually even if Pain holds for awhile, he still falls because there's not much of an answer he would have against the speed and tactical genius of Minato.\n\n5th:\n\n* We know how that turned out\n\n6th:\n\n* I mean Kakashi loses, but if we're talking peak Kakashi with the Susanoo, then Pain probably loses?\n\n7th:\n\n* Stomps. Looking at just Hokage Naruto, Pain obviously loses the worst here. A fully controlled Kyuubi form + a yellow flash form + sage mode form + SoSP form. He downright beats the hell out of pain without breaking a sweat. \n\nSo\n\n6th < 5th < 3rd < Pain =< 2nd =< 4th <<<<<< 1st <<<<<<<<<<<<<< 7th",
