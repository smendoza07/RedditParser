I wasn\u2019t including obito in that statement as he left the village a while ago. There are a couple things to consider tho. Like I believe itachi could have done it without obito. In fact the only reason why he asked obito was because he thought he was madara back for vengeance against the leaf and just ask him if he would just eliminate the uchiha since they had betrayed him a long time ago. Itachis two conditions were sasuke being safe and the rest of the village. Lastly Danzo believed that itachi could do it by himself and hiruzen also believed itachi could do it by himself. He obviously didn\u2019t but he probably could",

In fact the only reason why he asked obito was because he thought he was madara back for vengeance against the leaf and just ask him if he would just eliminate the uchiha since they had betrayed him a long time ago. Itachis two conditions were sasuke being safe and the rest of the village. Lastly Danzo believed that itachi could do it by himself and hiruzen also believed itachi could do it by himself.

In fact the only reason why he asked obito was because he thought he was madara back for vengeance against the leaf and just ask him if he would just eliminate the uchiha since they had betrayed him a long time ago. Itachis two conditions were sasuke being safe and the rest of the village. Lastly Danzo believed that itachi could do it by himself and hiruzen also believed itachi could do it by himself.
