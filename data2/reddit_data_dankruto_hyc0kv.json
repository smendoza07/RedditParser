Now we all saw that the Uchiha can was not small at the time of the formation of the leaf. Between the first and the Second effectively one generation of clan leaders (due to the closeness of age of hasirama and tobirama) somehow the clan was so reduced that by the time the 3rd began his reign the only 2 Senju we hear about are Tsunade and Nawaki. Meaning that Hashiramas son was worth trash or not a shinobi. The clan was almost non-existent and the death of Tsunade will or has ended it. Now how on earth did he cause all that and he is still considered a good hokage. He isn't he couldn't even keep his clan alive let alone the village.",

It was quite literally his last words to never trust the Senju. And yeah, he did choose Hiruzen, because he didn't think hed fuck up so bad. \n\nLMAO Danzo pushed them out of the village. Tobirama didnt want MADARA to be Hokage. There is a difference. And Hiruzen and Tsunade also \"let\" wars happen while they were Hokage. Minato \"let\" the Nine Tails attack happen. Hashirama \"let\" Madara attack happen. Shit happens beyond your control.\n\nHiruzen did absolutely let Orochimaru go though, so thats 100s of dead men women and children on him. And of course, he also let Danzo do what he wanted, so the Uchiha Clan massacre, Root, and all that other shady shit? Also on him. These are things he could have directly put an end to, and didnt. In his own words, he was too Naive as a Hokage.\n\nTobirama also created the Uchiha Police to give them power as a clan while also watching over any potential dangers, ANBU, and the Ninja Academy. He also created FTG, Shadow Clones, and Edo, all jutsu that would be instrumental in saving the world.\n\nWhat has Hiruzen done? Uh, be a nice guy? Make some speeches? Be a naive idiot who lets whole clans die and child murderers escape? I'm confused here dude. His biggest contribution was probably his two NON CHILD KILLER students, one of which was a far better leader than him. Being nice isnt being a leader. Not to mention half your points are stuff you made up and attributed to Tobirama lol. Danzo wasnt even one of his students.",

Because it's not just skill that makes a hokage it's also the villages inner politics. (Orochimaru lost the chance at hokage because minato was more popular.) Also the Uchiha clan couldn't arrest members of ANBU without some type of warrant or approval from the hokage as the ANBU are the direct warriors of the Hokage.\n\nYou can't pick a specific point to say a jutsu is good or bad. The Edo tensi was used to help destroy the leaf at one point and to resurrect Madara. The unfinished flying thunder God technique was in the scroll of seals which was stolen...and almost handed to orochimaru who could've done god knows what with it...so in essence he created several major weapons and hoped that they never got out with no true failsafe.\n\nAlso they were already in peace talks off and on before tobirama killed Izuna also I need you to source where you got Izuna was a war hawk because while his last words may have been don't trust the Senju one of them literally just killed him.

He didn't like the Uchiha and didn't want peace with them and definitely didn't want them to grow in power.\nMinato as strong as he was would have been hard-pressed to beat orochimaru. Minato was faster because of a jutsu not he could evade and attack in blind spots because he could teleport he's not a guy or Lee level speed character. Orochimaru was fast consistently not just for quick blips. And experience is in fact the best teacher Orochimaru beats minato in experience all day long. Minato ended the war with one jutsu but we're any of the sanin at that battle...no because 2 of them likely could have done the same thing. Jiraiya had the swamp of the underworld and orochimaru had the snake conjuring jutsu that allows him to summon an army of snakes that can be augmented to release swords from their mouths...",

Jack of all trades, master of none is definitely not better than a master of one in this scenario. And his other accomplishments? Not helping the Fourth Hokage when during the Nine-Tails attack, failing to fulfil his promise about looking after Naruto that he made to Minato while he was dying, refusing to let anyone else look after Naruto for purely political reasons (couldn\u2019t let the Uchiha look after the kid with the deadly fox spirit), basically let Danzo run the damn village while he was alive, forcing a kid to spy on his clan and then not preventing their genocide when a better alternative was presented, not killing Orochimaru when he had the chance in the first place, not killing Orochimaru when he had the opportunity the second time round (summon a third clone at least! Come on!), forcing Naruto (son of the Fourth Hokage) to grow up friendless and alone, giving him a pittance to live off\u2026 I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t give the infant Naruto to Danzo.

In one of the filler flashback, Hiruzen went to the forest with Naruto and they had a good time. During the war arc, Naruto even praises Hiruzen as the Hokage, saying he's a big reason for him wanting to be Hokage. Hiruzen is qlso thr one to cause Iruka to open up to Naruto. \n\nCould he have done more for Naruto by giving him a better place to live and actual food and money? Hell yes. But he couldn't possibly make the whole village accept Naruto with open arms. Plus, thats the whole premise of Naruto wanting to prove himself because everyone neglected and hated him.",

If any one clan was to take him in it would give that clan way too much power the sarutobi couldn't have given Naruto a home 1 they were a weak clan overall and 2 the Uchiha, Senju remnants, and Huugya would have blown a gasket and threatened to leave. It's not really defection if an entire clan leaves. Also rememberthis was at the height of one of the most unstable times in the hidden leaf village they were just coming off the tail end of the war they had the Kyuubi attack happen and the Uchiha was about to be wiped out they couldn't risk any more destabilization it would have given the hokage way too much power and no one would have been able to check in Danzo would not have let it happen. The council which is never really explained would not have allowed this. Honestly as much as I dislike it I can see how his hands were tied. This would have been the catalyst to the civil war he was trying to avoid. Especially since he was losing the support of one of his strongest clams and another strong clan was pissed at him.\n\n1 the Uchiha clan was pissed for all the things the 2nd did that he didn't fix.\n2 the Hyuuga were pissed that their next leader was kidnapped and one of them had to die for 'peace'\n3 the sarutobi couldn't fight any other Leaf clan and honestly expect to win they had one S Rand and one A rank at best.\n4 The inuzuka, the aki-yami-nara trio would have remained loyal only if the Nara said to which is a coin toss. The hatake was down to one man. And the clanless don't stand a chance against the kekkigenkai users Guy being the one off that might make it work. Honestly the best he could've done was what he did to avoid a civil war that would have crippled the village to the point that Stone, Sand(who was barely an ally) and Cloud would have rolled over not to mention his own students were either gone(orochimaru), avoiding the village(Tsunade), or keeping the leaf relevant to the rest of the world(Jiraya).\n\nThe biggest Deterrents to a civil war were gone and he was on the the edge of losing it all.

Additionally no one plans a coup that could potentially start a civil war unless they have good reason.\n\nA poor example would be the American civil war. The south had an absolute slew of reasons to break away. And thus it started.\n\nOne or two insults isn't enough to start a coup or the Hyuuga would've lost it over the whole paying reparations to Kumo over Hinata's kidnapping.\n\nEDIT: Anyone that smells an opportunity to better their position would have to pick a side and while the Uchiha were alienated because of their position as a police force, the village isolates the clanless generally irrelevant positions unless they have proven themselves in a massive way. The clans are treated far better. We never saw the details of the coup we just know it was going to happen it's likely the Uchiha were the vanguard for a larger force.

Kishimoto 100% wasn't planning ahead to Minato's death, the reaper death seal, or the importance reanimatuon would have and the need for the seals to be broken. He was bringing back Hokage and showing what they looked like for the scene, likely already planned for Naruto's dad to be the fourth, but didn't wanna show him off just yet. \n\nThat said, its still fun to find a reason that fits in universe as to what was happening. Personally, I like the theory that it was the fourth Kazekage. Orochimaru had just killed him, and we knew that to be the case at the time iirc, and if his goal was just to ensure the death of Hiruzen then summoning all that he could was his best bet. The next best theory to me is that he was attempting to summon Minato but failed in that moment due to the seal, even if they didn't realize that was why it failed. Both these fit into the cannon and don't contradict what we know, so its fair game.",

Minato says that he couldn\u2019t seal the entire nine tails in 1 go, so he sealed half in himself, and used another seal to seal in Naruto. He couldn\u2019t seal in Kushina probably due to how the sealing Jutsu works. Also the 2-7 tails weren\u2019t in full control of their actions, it\u2019s hard to say if they were going all out.",

Someone below said that maybe orochimaru was reviving the fourth kazekage whom he had just killed and i think that makes a lot more sense.",

If it isn't sealing something in a scroll or blowing something up with a piece of paper most shinobi ignored it until they paid the ultimate price.

Then suddenly it was nothing. Basically, the first few times a stronger opponent comes it is fine, then it gets to more and more ridiculous levels. Worst thing is how they always make it sound like \"this is it, this guy is the strongest\" and then few minutes later \"actually nope, this guy who was there all along and it makes no sense for people to not have known about him is waaaaay stronger\". Yes, I really hate this trope and believe that it can be done better than by simply increasing the power of the opponents.\n\nHonestly though, I had no idea what they were gonna do with Boruto since the ultimate villain of that universe was pretty much already killed, I mean Kaguya was the mother of all chakra, a literal god and the two who have killed her are still alive, so what have they brought forth as an upcoming enemy?",

He did right so why i the fck did he not let one of his family members or his son or daugther take care of naruto but no he instead left him live solo in an appartment and also let the villagers   hate him for being a jinjuriki wtf?? When i know the facts that kushina trust naruto to the 3rd hokage and knowing the facts that he doesn't even give a shit about naruto, it make me angry knowing the facts that his parents give there life for protecting the god damn village and this is what they do to naruto? And don't get me started to kakashi he know's that naruto is minato's son MINATO'S GOD DAMN SON and he treated naruto just like a hes a nobody when he was a kid, i remember when watching a scene with kakashi and jiraiya after naruto and sasuke fight in the roof top, kakashi get's angry with jiraiya why he teach naruto the rasegan the technic that his father also use, and question jiraiya for that, that scene almost get me angry sometimes bro NARUTO IS YOUR SENSEI SON THE FOURTH HOKAGE THE HOKAGE THAT GIVE HIS LIVE OF YOUR GOD DAMN VILLAGE, and you treat his son as a supid mf?? This is the reason why i hate the 3rd hokage and kakashi, when naruto is a kid kakashi never acknowledge him he never see his potential, jiraiya is the one who trully respect naruto and give him credit for his hardwork, naruto may not be the smart one but he have heart, i hope you understand my post sorry for my english and my gramar",

Now we all saw that the Uchiha can was not small at the time of the formation of the leaf. Between the first and the Second effectively one generation of clan leaders (due to the closeness of age of hasirama and tobirama) somehow the clan was so reduced that by the time the 3rd began his reign the only 2 Senju we hear about are Tsunade and Nawaki. Meaning that Hashiramas son was worth trash or not a shinobi. The clan was almost non-existent and the death of Tsunade will or has ended it. Now how on earth did he cause all that and he is still considered a good hokage. He isn't he couldn't even keep his clan alive let alone the village.",

It was quite literally his last words to never trust the Senju. And yeah, he did choose Hiruzen, because he didn't think hed fuck up so bad. \n\nLMAO Danzo pushed them out of the village. Tobirama didnt want MADARA to be Hokage. There is a difference. And Hiruzen and Tsunade also \"let\" wars happen while they were Hokage. Minato \"let\" the Nine Tails attack happen. Hashirama \"let\" Madara attack happen. Shit happens beyond your control.\n\nHiruzen did absolutely let Orochimaru go though, so thats 100s of dead men women and children on him. And of course, he also let Danzo do what he wanted, so the Uchiha Clan massacre, Root, and all that other shady shit? Also on him. These are things he could have directly put an end to, and didnt. In his own words, he was too Naive as a Hokage.\n\nTobirama also created the Uchiha Police to give them power as a clan while also watching over any potential dangers, ANBU, and the Ninja Academy. He also created FTG, Shadow Clones, and Edo, all jutsu that would be instrumental in saving the world.\n\nWhat has Hiruzen done? Uh, be a nice guy? Make some speeches? Be a naive idiot who lets whole clans die and child murderers escape? I'm confused here dude. His biggest contribution was probably his two NON CHILD KILLER students, one of which was a far better leader than him. Being nice isnt being a leader. Not to mention half your points are stuff you made up and attributed to Tobirama lol. Danzo wasnt even one of his students.",

Because it's not just skill that makes a hokage it's also the villages inner politics. (Orochimaru lost the chance at hokage because minato was more popular.) Also the Uchiha clan couldn't arrest members of ANBU without some type of warrant or approval from the hokage as the ANBU are the direct warriors of the Hokage.\n\nYou can't pick a specific point to say a jutsu is good or bad. The Edo tensi was used to help destroy the leaf at one point and to resurrect Madara. The unfinished flying thunder God technique was in the scroll of seals which was stolen...and almost handed to orochimaru who could've done god knows what with it...so in essence he created several major weapons and hoped that they never got out with no true failsafe.\n\nAlso they were already in peace talks off and on before tobirama killed Izuna also I need you to source where you got Izuna was a war hawk because while his last words may have been don't trust the Senju one of them literally just killed him.

If any one clan was to take him in it would give that clan way too much power the sarutobi couldn't have given Naruto a home 1 they were a weak clan overall and 2 the Uchiha, Senju remnants, and Huugya would have blown a gasket and threatened to leave. It's not really defection if an entire clan leaves. Also rememberthis was at the height of one of the most unstable times in the hidden leaf village they were just coming off the tail end of the war they had the Kyuubi attack happen and the Uchiha was about to be wiped out they couldn't risk any more destabilization it would have given the hokage way too much power and no one would have been able to check in Danzo would not have let it happen. The council which is never really explained would not have allowed this. Honestly as much as I dislike it I can see how his hands were tied. This would have been the catalyst to the civil war he was trying to avoid. Especially since he was losing the support of one of his strongest clams and another strong clan was pissed at him.\n\n1 the Uchiha clan was pissed for all the things the 2nd did that he didn't fix.\n2 the Hyuuga were pissed that their next leader was kidnapped and one of them had to die for 'peace'\n3 the sarutobi couldn't fight any other Leaf clan and honestly expect to win they had one S Rand and one A rank at best.\n4 The inuzuka, the aki-yami-nara trio would have remained loyal only if the Nara said to which is a coin toss. The hatake was down to one man. And the clanless don't stand a chance against the kekkigenkai users Guy being the one off that might make it work. Honestly the best he could've done was what he did to avoid a civil war that would have crippled the village to the point that Stone, Sand(who was barely an ally) and Cloud would have rolled over not to mention his own students were either gone(orochimaru), avoiding the village(Tsunade), or keeping the leaf relevant to the rest of the world(Jiraya).\n\nThe biggest Deterrents to a civil war were gone and he was on the the edge of losing it all.

Additionally no one plans a coup that could potentially start a civil war unless they have good reason.\n\nA poor example would be the American civil war. The south had an absolute slew of reasons to break away. And thus it started.\n\nOne or two insults isn't enough to start a coup or the Hyuuga would've lost it over the whole paying reparations to Kumo over Hinata's kidnapping.\n\nEDIT: Anyone that smells an opportunity to better their position would have to pick a side and while the Uchiha were alienated because of their position as a police force, the village isolates the clanless generally irrelevant positions unless they have proven themselves in a massive way. The clans are treated far better. We never saw the details of the coup we just know it was going to happen it's likely the Uchiha were the vanguard for a larger force. There are a few documents from the Village hidden in the leaves I'd love for kishimoto to expand and create for us to speculate over.",

Kishimoto 100% wasn't planning ahead to Minato's death, the reaper death seal, or the importance reanimatuon would have and the need for the seals to be broken. He was bringing back Hokage and showing what they looked like for the scene, likely already planned for Naruto's dad to be the fourth, but didn't wanna show him off just yet. \n\nThat said, its still fun to find a reason that fits in universe as to what was happening. Personally, I like the theory that it was the fourth Kazekage. Orochimaru had just killed him, and we knew that to be the case at the time iirc, and if his goal was just to ensure the death of Hiruzen then summoning all that he could was his best bet. The next best theory to me is that he was attempting to summon Minato but failed in that moment due to the seal, even if they didn't realize that was why it failed. Both these fit into the cannon and don't contradict what we know, so its fair game.",

Well while we're at it let's forget how many died protecting it or the fact that this kid is supposed to keep us safe when all we ever see him do is cry...no we totally trust some ink and a little bit of stolen nature energy...sealing is one of the most complex arts their is and you expect the random shop owners to understand something from the shinobi side of the house that even most shinobi don't understand. If it isn't sealing something in a scroll or blowing something up with a piece of paper most shinobi ignored it until they paid the ultimate price. Hence why the uzumaki were wiped out they stepped out of line and specialized in something no one wanted to take the time to learn to actually counter. How many seal masters were in of the leaf during the chuunin exams\n1 Orochimaru\n2 Jiraya\n3 Hiruzen\n4 the barrier teams...maybe...\n5 maybe one or two anbu if we're lucky and pretending that the hidden leaf isn't stupid enough to know that the Black Ops need to be able to do a Bit of everything.",

Then suddenly it was nothing. Basically, the first few times a stronger opponent comes it is fine, then it gets to more and more ridiculous levels. Worst thing is how they always make it sound like \"this is it, this guy is the strongest\" and then few minutes later \"actually nope, this guy who was there all along and it makes no sense for people to not have known about him is waaaaay stronger\". Yes, I really hate this trope and believe that it can be done better than by simply increasing the power of the opponents.\n\nHonestly though, I had no idea what they were gonna do with Boruto since the ultimate villain of that universe was pretty much already killed, I mean Kaguya was the mother of all chakra, a literal god and the two who have killed her are still alive, so what have they brought forth as an upcoming enemy?",

Now we all saw that the Uchiha can was not small at the time of the formation of the leaf. Between the first and the Second effectively one generation of clan leaders (due to the closeness of age of hasirama and tobirama) somehow the clan was so reduced that by the time the 3rd began his reign the only 2 Senju we hear about are Tsunade and Nawaki. Meaning that Hashiramas son was worth trash or not a shinobi. The clan was almost non-existent and the death of Tsunade will or has ended it. Now how on earth did he cause all that and he is still considered a good hokage. He isn't he couldn't even keep his clan alive let alone the village.",

It was quite literally his last words to never trust the Senju. And yeah, he did choose Hiruzen, because he didn't think hed fuck up so bad. \n\nLMAO Danzo pushed them out of the village. Tobirama didnt want MADARA to be Hokage. There is a difference. And Hiruzen and Tsunade also \"let\" wars happen while they were Hokage. Minato \"let\" the Nine Tails attack happen. Hashirama \"let\" Madara attack happen. Shit happens beyond your control.\n\nHiruzen did absolutely let Orochimaru go though, so thats 100s of dead men women and children on him. And of course, he also let Danzo do what he wanted, so the Uchiha Clan massacre, Root, and all that other shady shit? Also on him. These are things he could have directly put an end to, and didnt. In his own words, he was too Naive as a Hokage.\n\nTobirama also created the Uchiha Police to give them power as a clan while also watching over any potential dangers, ANBU, and the Ninja Academy. He also created FTG, Shadow Clones, and Edo, all jutsu that would be instrumental in saving the world.\n\nWhat has Hiruzen done? Uh, be a nice guy? Make some speeches? Be a naive idiot who lets whole clans die and child murderers escape? I'm confused here dude. His biggest contribution was probably his two NON CHILD KILLER students, one of which was a far better leader than him. Being nice isnt being a leader. Not to mention half your points are stuff you made up and attributed to Tobirama lol. Danzo wasnt even one of his students.",

Because it's not just skill that makes a hokage it's also the villages inner politics. (Orochimaru lost the chance at hokage because minato was more popular.) Also the Uchiha clan couldn't arrest members of ANBU without some type of warrant or approval from the hokage as the ANBU are the direct warriors of the Hokage.\n\nYou can't pick a specific point to say a jutsu is good or bad. The Edo tensi was used to help destroy the leaf at one point and to resurrect Madara. The unfinished flying thunder God technique was in the scroll of seals which was stolen...and almost handed to orochimaru who could've done god knows what with it...so in essence he created several major weapons and hoped that they never got out with no true failsafe.\n\nAlso they were already in peace talks off and on before tobirama killed Izuna also I need you to source where you got Izuna was a war hawk because while his last words may have been don't trust the Senju one of them literally just killed him.

He didn't like the Uchiha and didn't want peace with them and definitely didn't want them to grow in power.\nMinato as strong as he was would have been hard-pressed to beat orochimaru. Minato was faster because of a jutsu not he could evade and attack in blind spots because he could teleport he's not a guy or Lee level speed character. Orochimaru was fast consistently not just for quick blips. And experience is in fact the best teacher Orochimaru beats minato in experience all day long. Minato ended the war with one jutsu but we're any of the sanin at that battle...no because 2 of them likely could have done the same thing. Jiraiya had the swamp of the underworld and orochimaru had the snake conjuring jutsu that allows him to summon an army of snakes that can be augmented to release swords from their mouths...",

Not helping the Fourth Hokage when during the Nine-Tails attack, failing to fulfil his promise about looking after Naruto that he made to Minato while he was dying, refusing to let anyone else look after Naruto for purely political reasons (couldn\u2019t let the Uchiha look after the kid with the deadly fox spirit), basically let Danzo run the damn village while he was alive, forcing a kid to spy on his clan and then not preventing their genocide when a better alternative was presented, not killing Orochimaru when he had the chance in the first place, not killing Orochimaru when he had the opportunity the second time round (summon a third clone at least! Come on!), forcing Naruto (son of the Fourth Hokage) to grow up friendless and alone, giving him a pittance to live off\u2026 I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t give the infant Naruto to Danzo.

In one of the filler flashback, Hiruzen went to the forest with Naruto and they had a good time. During the war arc, Naruto even praises Hiruzen as the Hokage, saying he's a big reason for him wanting to be Hokage. Hiruzen is qlso thr one to cause Iruka to open up to Naruto. \n\nCould he have done more for Naruto by giving him a better place to live and actual food and money? Hell yes.

It's not really defection if an entire clan leaves. Also rememberthis was at the height of one of the most unstable times in the hidden leaf village they were just coming off the tail end of the war they had the Kyuubi attack happen and the Uchiha was about to be wiped out they couldn't risk any more destabilization it would have given the hokage way too much power and no one would have been able to check in Danzo would not have let it happen. The council which is never really explained would not have allowed this. Honestly as much as I dislike it I can see how his hands were tied. This would have been the catalyst to the civil war he was trying to avoid. Especially since he was losing the support of one of his strongest clams and another strong clan was pissed at him.\n\n1 the Uchiha clan was pissed for all the things the 2nd did that he didn't fix.\n2 the Hyuuga were pissed that their next leader was kidnapped and one of them had to die for 'peace'\n3 the sarutobi couldn't fight any other Leaf clan and honestly expect to win they had one S Rand and one A rank at best.\n4 The inuzuka, the aki-yami-nara trio would have remained loyal only if the Nara said to which is a coin toss. The hatake was down to one man. And the clanless don't stand a chance against the kekkigenkai users Guy being the one off that might make it work. Honestly the best he could've done was what he did to avoid a civil war that would have crippled the village to the point that Stone, Sand(who was barely an ally) and Cloud would have rolled over not to mention his own students were either gone(orochimaru), avoiding the village(Tsunade), or keeping the leaf relevant to the rest of the world(Jiraya).\n\nThe biggest Deterrents to a civil war were gone and he was on the the edge of losing it all.

Additionally no one plans a coup that could potentially start a civil war unless they have good reason.\n\nA poor example would be the American civil war. The south had an absolute slew of reasons to break away. And thus it started.\n\nOne or two insults isn't enough to start a coup or the Hyuuga would've lost it over the whole paying reparations to Kumo over Hinata's kidnapping.\n\nEDIT: Anyone that smells an opportunity to better their position would have to pick a side and while the Uchiha were alienated because of their position as a police force, the village isolates the clanless generally irrelevant positions unless they have proven themselves in a massive way. The clans are treated far better. We never saw the details of the coup we just know it was going to happen it's likely the Uchiha were the vanguard for a larger force.

Kishimoto 100% wasn't planning ahead to Minato's death, the reaper death seal, or the importance reanimatuon would have and the need for the seals to be broken. He was bringing back Hokage and showing what they looked like for the scene, likely already planned for Naruto's dad to be the fourth, but didn't wanna show him off just yet. \n\nThat said, its still fun to find a reason that fits in universe as to what was happening. Personally, I like the theory that it was the fourth Kazekage. Orochimaru had just killed him, and we knew that to be the case at the time iirc, and if his goal was just to ensure the death of Hiruzen then summoning all that he could was his best bet. The next best theory to me is that he was attempting to summon Minato but failed in that moment due to the seal, even if they didn't realize that was why it failed. Both these fit into the cannon and don't contradict what we know, so its fair game.",

Then suddenly it was nothing. Basically, the first few times a stronger opponent comes it is fine, then it gets to more and more ridiculous levels. Worst thing is how they always make it sound like \"this is it, this guy is the strongest\" and then few minutes later \"actually nope, this guy who was there all along and it makes no sense for people to not have known about him is waaaaay stronger\". Yes, I really hate this trope and believe that it can be done better than by simply increasing the power of the opponents.\n\nHonestly though, I had no idea what they were gonna do with Boruto since the ultimate villain of that universe was pretty much already killed, I mean Kaguya was the mother of all chakra, a literal god and the two who have killed her are still alive, so what have they brought forth as an upcoming enemy?",

Between the first and the Second effectively one generation of clan leaders (due to the closeness of age of hasirama and tobirama) somehow the clan was so reduced that by the time the 3rd began his reign the only 2 Senju we hear about are Tsunade and Nawaki. Meaning that Hashiramas son was worth trash or not a shinobi. The clan was almost non-existent and the death of Tsunade will or has ended it. Now how on earth did he cause all that and he is still considered a good hokage. He isn't he couldn't even keep his clan alive let alone the village.",

It was quite literally his last words to never trust the Senju. And yeah, he did choose Hiruzen, because he didn't think hed fuck up so bad. \n\nLMAO Danzo pushed them out of the village. Tobirama didnt want MADARA to be Hokage. There is a difference. And Hiruzen and Tsunade also \"let\" wars happen while they were Hokage. Minato \"let\" the Nine Tails attack happen. Hashirama \"let\" Madara attack happen. Shit happens beyond your control.\n\nHiruzen did absolutely let Orochimaru go though, so thats 100s of dead men women and children on him. And of course, he also let Danzo do what he wanted, so the Uchiha Clan massacre, Root, and all that other shady shit? Also on him. These are things he could have directly put an end to, and didnt. In his own words, he was too Naive as a Hokage.\n\nTobirama also created the Uchiha Police to give them power as a clan while also watching over any potential dangers, ANBU, and the Ninja Academy. He also created FTG, Shadow Clones, and Edo, all jutsu that would be instrumental in saving the world.\n\nWhat has Hiruzen done? Uh, be a nice guy? Make some speeches? Be a naive idiot who lets whole clans die and child murderers escape? I'm confused here dude. His biggest contribution was probably his two NON CHILD KILLER students, one of which was a far better leader than him. Being nice isnt being a leader. Not to mention half your points are stuff you made up and attributed to Tobirama lol. Danzo wasnt even one of his students.",

Because it's not just skill that makes a hokage it's also the villages inner politics. (Orochimaru lost the chance at hokage because minato was more popular.) Also the Uchiha clan couldn't arrest members of ANBU without some type of warrant or approval from the hokage as the ANBU are the direct warriors of the Hokage.\n\nYou can't pick a specific point to say a jutsu is good or bad. The Edo tensi was used to help destroy the leaf at one point and to resurrect Madara. The unfinished flying thunder God technique was in the scroll of seals which was stolen...and almost handed to orochimaru who could've done god knows what with it...so in essence he created several major weapons and hoped that they never got out with no true failsafe.\n\nAlso they were already in peace talks off and on before tobirama killed Izuna also I need you to source where you got Izuna was a war hawk because while his last words may have been don't trust the Senju one of them literally just killed him.

Minato was faster because of a jutsu not he could evade and attack in blind spots because he could teleport he's not a guy or Lee level speed character. Orochimaru was fast consistently not just for quick blips. And experience is in fact the best teacher Orochimaru beats minato in experience all day long. Minato ended the war with one jutsu but we're any of the sanin at that battle...no because 2 of them likely could have done the same thing.

Additionally no one plans a coup that could potentially start a civil war unless they have good reason.\n\nA poor example would be the American civil war. The south had an absolute slew of reasons to break away. And thus it started.\n\nOne or two insults isn't enough to start a coup or the Hyuuga would've lost it over the whole paying reparations to Kumo over Hinata's kidnapping.\n\nEDIT: Anyone that smells an opportunity to better their position would have to pick a side and while the Uchiha were alienated because of their position as a police force, the village isolates the clanless generally irrelevant positions unless they have proven themselves in a massive way. The clans are treated far better. We never saw the details of the coup we just know it was going to happen it's likely the Uchiha were the vanguard for a larger force.

Kabuto was very clearly an undercover agent. Or are we to believe he just didn't know? But how could that be the case? It just makes no sense.",

Tobirama didnt want MADARA to be Hokage. There is a difference. And Hiruzen and Tsunade also \"let\" wars happen while they were Hokage. Minato \"let\" the Nine Tails attack happen. Hashirama \"let\" Madara attack happen. Shit happens beyond your control.\n\nHiruzen did absolutely let Orochimaru go though, so thats 100s of dead men women and children on him. And of course, he also let Danzo do what he wanted, so the Uchiha Clan massacre, Root, and all that other shady shit? Also on him. These are things he could have directly put an end to, and didnt. In his own words, he was too Naive as a Hokage.\n\nTobirama also created the Uchiha Police to give them power as a clan while also watching over any potential dangers, ANBU, and the Ninja Academy. He also created FTG, Shadow Clones, and Edo, all jutsu that would be instrumental in saving the world.\n\nWhat has Hiruzen done? Uh, be a nice guy? Make some speeches? Be a naive idiot who lets whole clans die and child murderers escape? I'm confused here dude. His biggest contribution was probably his two NON CHILD KILLER students, one of which was a far better leader than him. Being nice isnt being a leader. Not to mention half your points are stuff you made up and attributed to Tobirama lol. Danzo wasnt even one of his students.",

Also the Uchiha clan couldn't arrest members of ANBU without some type of warrant or approval from the hokage as the ANBU are the direct warriors of the Hokage.\n\nYou can't pick a specific point to say a jutsu is good or bad. The Edo tensi was used to help destroy the leaf at one point and to resurrect Madara. The unfinished flying thunder God technique was in the scroll of seals which was stolen...and almost handed to orochimaru who could've done god knows what with it...so in essence he created several major weapons and hoped that they never got out with no true failsafe.\n\nAlso they were already in peace talks off and on before tobirama killed Izuna also I need you to source where you got Izuna was a war hawk because while his last words may have been don't trust the Senju one of them literally just killed him.

Orochimaru was fast consistently not just for quick blips. And experience is in fact the best teacher Orochimaru beats minato in experience all day long. Minato ended the war with one jutsu but we're any of the sanin at that battle...no because 2 of them likely could have done the same thing.

Additionally no one plans a coup that could potentially start a civil war unless they have good reason.\n\nA poor example would be the American civil war. The south had an absolute slew of reasons to break away. And thus it started.\n\nOne or two insults isn't enough to start a coup or the Hyuuga would've lost it over the whole paying reparations to Kumo over Hinata's kidnapping.\n\nEDIT: Anyone that smells an opportunity to better their position would have to pick a side and while the Uchiha were alienated because of their position as a police force, the village isolates the clanless generally irrelevant positions unless they have proven themselves in a massive way. The clans are treated far better. We never saw the details of the coup we just know it was going to happen it's likely the Uchiha were the vanguard for a larger force.

Also the Uchiha clan couldn't arrest members of ANBU without some type of warrant or approval from the hokage as the ANBU are the direct warriors of the Hokage.\n\nYou can't pick a specific point to say a jutsu is good or bad. The Edo tensi was used to help destroy the leaf at one point and to resurrect Madara. The unfinished flying thunder God technique was in the scroll of seals which was stolen...and almost handed to orochimaru who could've done god knows what with it...so in essence he created several major weapons and hoped that they never got out with no true failsafe.\n\nAlso they were already in peace talks off and on before tobirama killed Izuna also I need you to source where you got Izuna was a war hawk because while his last words may have been don't trust the Senju one of them literally just killed him.

I think Narutos 9 tails went from being 50% to closer to 80-90%, and combinging both halves allows for the 100% to be unlocked. Minato says that he couldn\u2019t seal the entire nine tails in 1 go, so he sealed half in himself, and used another seal to seal in Naruto. He couldn\u2019t seal in Kushina probably due to how the sealing Jutsu works. Also the 2-7 tails weren\u2019t in full control of their actions, it\u2019s hard to say if they were going all out.",
