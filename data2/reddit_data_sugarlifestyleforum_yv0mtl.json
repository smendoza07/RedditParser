    "body": "throwaway for many reasons as I knew better and ashamed I didn\u2019t hold up to my knowledge. I\u2019m so angry I was this naive and trusting but lesson learned.\n\nI recently started back sugaring after losing my job unexpectedly from a 3 month break. I met with a POT I found on Secret Benefits for coffee last week and we hit it off. He seemed normal and had an outgoing personality. Talked highly of his job and his achievements. We got into deeper conversations and he asked me why I sugar, then mentioned he was a findom. I asked what that was as I\u2019ve never heard of it and he explained (google it). He asked me what my life struggles are at the moment and I mentioned winter clothes for my 2 children as they\u2019re still in last years and my oldest is getting bullied for his pants showing his legs by a kid which resulted in them both being suspended for 2 days. He said he loved kids & he would love to continue seeing me that he would change my life. Promised me an x.xxx allowance per meet and anything else I needed like groceries or bills and them an entire new wardrobe of the finest clothes, even said he would pay off my credit card debt and get me a new phone. I found him attractive and loved his smile, I thought my life was gonna change with him that I hit the jackpot. \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe had a second date scheduled for dinner that went amazing. It felt like a vanilla date I didn\u2019t want it to end. It unexpectedly led to him asking if I wanted to stay the night at a hotel close by and whatever happens happens that no pressure. I agreed and we went after. Things got hot and heavy fast, lots of sex. I ended up spending the night. From what he talked before I wasn\u2019t worried about him not paying. When we woke up he doordash us breakfest and said he had to get going soon for some work he had to catch up on. He said he didn\u2019t bring cash since this was last second planned but would send the ppm when he got service after leaving that he doesn\u2019t trust sending through the hotels wifi. My heart started to sink as worry set in with the what ifs, is this too good to be true, did I just get played, who doesn\u2019t trust wifi or just everything in my mind was rolling. We both part ways. After an hour I asked if he got the chance to send it yet and crickets. By 5pm I asked again and he said he was sorry he\u2019s been super busy. Next morning I go to text and he won\u2019t respond. Nothing. Sent another text at 3ish and nothing. I get a text that night saying his cards are locked asking if I could wait until it\u2019s sorted then try\u2019s to make a new meet set up. I asked in a sorta \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d way how would he be able to buy a hotel if cards are locked and he sent me a paragraph telling me how stupid and naive I am. How I was a cum dump and all sorts of awful disgusting things this man took the time to think of and to tell me. I didn\u2019t even respond and blocked him.\n\nRant over. It\u2019s important to not let anyone have the chance or opportunity to pull this. I trusted him based on what he said and promised. Don\u2019t take any sd seriously unless they show or prove to you what they mean. Anyone can say anything and I learned the hard way no matter what\u2019s said, PPM comes first. Until then it\u2019s empty promises.",

Now I\u2019ve handed her an envelope before we are intimate.   She can trust me at that point.   Some other guys have used fake bills or whatever\u2026 I\u2019m not them, and that\u2019s an awful lot of fucking effort to save a few bucks.  I would argue it makes more sense to spend time getting to know the guy to the point this ain\u2019t a concern.  If you\u2019re going to a hotel with a guy you just met after a coffee, the risk of a scam is high.  If you\u2019ve had a M&G, gotten a gif, and now another date, I think the risk is very low, and this isn\u2019t supposed to be pay for play.",

Scenario 1:  she has sex with him, doesn\u2019t get money.   Scenario 2: he gives her money, she runs off.  In *both* cases the \u201closs\u201d is money.   She didn\u2019t \u201close her dignity.\u201d   She didn\u2019t \u201close\u201d sex.  She had sex with him and lost the money. It is *exactly* equivalent \u2014 in either scenario one loses out on the same amount of money, and does so because the other person lied to them.  Both are shitty, but the \u201coh she lost her dignity\u201d is nonsense\u2014 she fucked a guy she was willing to fuck \u2014 she lost money not dignity.",

Some other guys have used fake bills or whatever\u2026 I\u2019m not them, and that\u2019s an awful lot of fucking effort to save a few bucks.  I would argue it makes more sense to spend time getting to know the guy to the point this ain\u2019t a concern.  If you\u2019re going to a hotel with a guy you just met after a coffee, the risk of a scam is high.  If you\u2019ve had a M&G, gotten a gif, and now another date, I think the risk is very low, and this isn\u2019t supposed to be pay for play.",

Some other guys have used fake bills or whatever\u2026 I\u2019m not them, and that\u2019s an awful lot of fucking effort to save a few bucks.  I would argue it makes more sense to spend time getting to know the guy to the point this ain\u2019t a concern.  If you\u2019re going to a hotel with a guy you just met after a coffee, the risk of a scam is high.  If you\u2019ve had a M&G, gotten a gif, and now another date, I think the risk is very low, and this isn\u2019t supposed to be pay for play.",
