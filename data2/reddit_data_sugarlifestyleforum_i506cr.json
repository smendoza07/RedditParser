    "body": "That is literally a message I got on SA after an SB I spoke to said she didn\u2019t want to ever have sex. I stopped replying to her messages, but she messaged \u201cit\u2019s weird, If you don\u2019t want to have sex with them, guys don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d.\n\nYES! That is exactly right. You are not even a little interesting to me if you do not plan on having sex with me one day. Conversations with you will not be interesting. I want nothing to do with you. I\u2019m no longer interested in talking to you even if it were free\u2014you\u2019re just a stranger. You\u2019re offering me nothing I want. I can easily talk with male friends for free and these friends make better company anyway.",

If I need emotional support, I pay a professional therapist. If I want to get laid, I start swiping indiscriminately on Tinder for a week and regret it afterwards. Or I could make an appointment with an escort and regret it afterwards (nothing against escorts, it's just that I leave them feeling like I'm chipping away at my soul). If I want a serious relationship (which I do), I stay active on regular dating apps.\n\nBut if I want a \"fun\" and \"low baggage\" sexual relationship with a woman who I find really attractive and \"out of my league\", I go to SA.\n\nThere's this misinformation about the existence of lonely old guys who merely want to be graced by the presence of young women and are willing to pay for it. I don't understand how anyone with a modicum of critical thinking skills thinks that this is prevalent enough that they can realistically find it.",

I think that after you remove all of the bad players on both sides, the ratio is still at least 5:1 \"real\" SBs to \"real\" SDs. But when you factor in how picky we are (at least how picky I am) and our sugar budgets, our advantage slips. Usually I have a handful of \"high priority\" POTs that I'm willing to chase a fair amount. Certainly if it's all one-sided, I move on to the next one. But early on, I'm definitely the one pursuing them more. I just know that down the line, they're going to have to put more effort into the SR to keep me from straying.",

The platonic SBs arent interesting to us, but they're still trying and there. And its still 1 real SD for ever ten scammers/johns.

It makes me feel so shitty for the SD and pot SBs they could be meeting. Once she found out I was a SB, she then keeps trying to ask for help. I'm like \"bitch go away\".",

I think that after you remove all of the bad players on both sides, the ratio is still at least 5:1 \"real\" SBs to \"real\" SDs. But when you factor in how picky we are (at least how picky I am) and our sugar budgets, our advantage slips. Usually I have a handful of \"high priority\" POTs that I'm willing to chase a fair amount. Certainly if it's all one-sided, I move on to the next one. But early on, I'm definitely the one pursuing them more. I just know that down the line, they're going to have to put more effort into the SR to keep me from straying.",

But if she's counting herself and others like her as a SB the ratio doesnt improve in her favor at all.\n\nUs being picky doesnt change the ratio at all, its still the same number of SBs. The platonic SBs arent interesting to us, but they're still trying and there. And its still 1 real SD for ever ten scammers/johns. So really even if you go with the 1:5 is signed up as a SD, we're 2% of the total amount of users.\n\nAssuming you go with one SB in the end, thats still only the top ~2% of SBs getting a SD. Not that its actually that dire. Any SB who legitimately tries and doesnt push platonic BS and who's in shape etc has much better odds, but its still very very competitive for them.",

I think that after you remove all of the bad players on both sides, the ratio is still at least 5:1 \"real\" SBs to \"real\" SDs. But when you factor in how picky we are (at least how picky I am) and our sugar budgets, our advantage slips. Usually I have a handful of \"high priority\" POTs that I'm willing to chase a fair amount. Certainly if it's all one-sided, I move on to the next one. But early on, I'm definitely the one pursuing them more. I just know that down the line, they're going to have to put more effort into the SR to keep me from straying.",

The platonic SBs arent interesting to us, but they're still trying and there. And its still 1 real SD for ever ten scammers/johns. So really even if you go with the 1:5 is signed up as a SD, we're 2% of the total amount of users.\n\nAssuming you go with one SB in the end, thats still only the top ~2% of SBs getting a SD.

I think that after you remove all of the bad players on both sides, the ratio is still at least 5:1 \"real\" SBs to \"real\" SDs. But when you factor in how picky we are (at least how picky I am) and our sugar budgets, our advantage slips. Usually I have a handful of \"high priority\" POTs that I'm willing to chase a fair amount. Certainly if it's all one-sided, I move on to the next one. But early on, I'm definitely the one pursuing them more. I just know that down the line, they're going to have to put more effort into the SR to keep me from straying.",

The platonic SBs arent interesting to us, but they're still trying and there. And its still 1 real SD for ever ten scammers/johns. So really even if you go with the 1:5 is signed up as a SD, we're 2% of the total amount of users.\n\nAssuming you go with one SB in the end, thats still only the top ~2% of SBs getting a SD. Not that its actually that dire. Any SB who legitimately tries and doesnt push platonic BS and who's in shape etc has much better odds, but its still very very competitive for them.",

The platonic SBs arent interesting to us, but they're still trying and there. And its still 1 real SD for ever ten scammers/johns. So really even if you go with the 1:5 is signed up as a SD, we're 2% of the total amount of users.\n\nAssuming you go with one SB in the end, thats still only the top ~2% of SBs getting a SD. Not that its actually that dire. Any SB who legitimately tries and doesnt push platonic BS and who's in shape etc has much better odds, but its still very very competitive for them.",
