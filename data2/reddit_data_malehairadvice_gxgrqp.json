I looked at a chart on hair type/curl types I also referred to r/curlyhair for opinion on what my curl type is. My final conclusion is that I have mostly 3c all around the top of my head and 4a right at my hairline (where the long hair starts). By determining my porosity I just put a hair follicle in a cup of water for 5 minutes. If it sunk You have high or medium porosity, if it floated you have low porosity. My hair floated so I have low porosity.",

My final conclusion is that I have mostly 3c all around the top of my head and 4a right at my hairline (where the long hair starts). By determining my porosity I just put a hair follicle in a cup of water for 5 minutes. If it sunk You have high or medium porosity, if it floated you have low porosity. My hair floated so I have low porosity.",
