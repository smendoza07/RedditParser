    "body": "This is gonna be controversial but I\u2019m saying it for my SB\u2019s who need to hear it!! So today I went and saw an SD I haven\u2019t seen since last year...only seen him 4 times prior (he\u2019s from out of town) and always got super drunk around him because I really didn\u2019t like being around him. He was just really rude and selfish. Anyways today, I didn\u2019t want to get drunk and I definitely didn\u2019t want to see him, but I wanted money. So I drove out to see him and the second I saw him everything in my body told me to leave, so you know what I did, I left. I didn\u2019t say anything besides \u201cOh I forgot something in my car\u201d to avoid any confrontation and more importantly for my safety too. And texted him saying \u201cSorry I can\u2019t do this, goodbye.\u201d I felt really bad for him but I also felt a huge relief. I felt like I had more control over my body and life than ever. That I can put my mental health before my bank account. I no longer will give my body to someone to someone who I don\u2019t like being around. Someone who I feel uneasy about, someone I simply don\u2019t feel connected to, no matter the amount of money. It\u2019s very easy to be kind and unfortunately, it\u2019s not very easy to find genuinely kind SD\u2019s. You know, a real gentlemen! Just remember ladies, you are in control. You set your own rules and your own values. Life is too short to be around people you cant stand. You deserve to be around someone who makes you happy! End of rant!",

Reading posts here is a great resource for SBs to know the importance of screening. I wish there is a class on how to screen for SBs. \n\nSecond, learn self defense techniques? Like a knee to the crotch? Simple martial arts, pepper sprays? \n\nI agree it is easy for me to say \"don't do anything you don't want to do.\" But given the high risks, I hope SBs will invest in preparing themselves for such bad situations. \n\nDoesn't it also depend upon building up your strength, self esteem and confidence to react to such situation with the attitude that \"I will not be exploited\"? \n\nThis is such a critical issue. I hope this forum can continue to be a great resource for SBs to gain the knowledge, skills and self confidence to handle bad situations. Thanks for your feedback.",

As you say, the SB can only do her best. I was just trying to suggest a few things that could fall within the parameters of \"doing her best\", to protect them selves, given the risks they run being SBs, and as you point out, this world has those dangerous and/or obnoxious characters. But I agree with you, they can still be vulnerable against these characters even after taking prudent precautions.",

Reading posts here is a great resource for SBs to know the importance of screening. I wish there is a class on how to screen for SBs. \n\nSecond, learn self defense techniques? Like a knee to the crotch? Simple martial arts, pepper sprays? \n\nI agree it is easy for me to say \"don't do anything you don't want to do.\" But given the high risks, I hope SBs will invest in preparing themselves for such bad situations. \n\nDoesn't it also depend upon building up your strength, self esteem and confidence to react to such situation with the attitude that \"I will not be exploited\"? \n\nThis is such a critical issue. I hope this forum can continue to be a great resource for SBs to gain the knowledge, skills and self confidence to handle bad situations. Thanks for your feedback.",

So, how can SBs, or any women for that matter, prepare to deal with it, if and when it happens? \n\nI would think, first, gain the knowledge and judgment not to put yourself in that situation, right? Reading posts here is a great resource for SBs to know the importance of screening. I wish there is a class on how to screen for SBs. \n\nSecond, learn self defense techniques? Like a knee to the crotch? Simple martial arts, pepper sprays? \n\nI agree it is easy for me to say \"don't do anything you don't want to do.\" But given the high risks, I hope SBs will invest in preparing themselves for such bad situations. \n\nDoesn't it also depend upon building up your strength, self esteem and confidence to react to such situation with the attitude that \"I will not be exploited\"? \n\nThis is such a critical issue. I hope this forum can continue to be a great resource for SBs to gain the knowledge, skills and self confidence to handle bad situations. Thanks for your feedback.",
