My partners hair is thinning so he's using it more because it's for \"thickening\". I have tried the hairburst stuff but the amount of hair I was loosing washing it was returning. Now trying Pantene grow strong, it's not falling out as much or as easy =) but it's not for thickening, just improving hair strength. Also shocking as i've recently dyed my hair again and I tend to have some hair loss from that but it has been minimal the odd hair",

My partners hair is thinning so he's using it more because it's for \"thickening\". I have tried the hairburst stuff but the amount of hair I was loosing washing it was returning. Now trying Pantene grow strong, it's not falling out as much or as easy =) but it's not for thickening, just improving hair strength. Also shocking as i've recently dyed my hair again and I tend to have some hair loss from that but it has been minimal the odd hair",
