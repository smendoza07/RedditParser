    "body": "I set my age range to 40-50+, and there were maybe a handful of guys hinting at an actual SR. On the other hand, there were a baffling number of guys who said they wanted an attractive young girl, but then specifically wrote in their profiles \u201cno sugar babies\u201d. I\u2019ve seen a 57 year old saying he wanted an 18-22 year old, between 5\u20196\u201d and 5\u20199\u201d, less than 133 lbs, but no sugar babies. Some of them blatantly say they don\u2019t even want to date, just have sex with hot young girls for free. I\u2019m 19, so they obviously lowered their age range by a lot for me to be able to see them. Where do these men get the idea that an 18-25 year old would date/hook up with a 40-60 year old man for free? I don\u2019t imagine they get many matches, but it\u2019s super annoying to swipe past 100 of them. Think I\u2019m just gonna stick to SA lol.",

A SR speeds up the process.  Just because I can \"sometimes\" attract a younger woman, doesn't mean that it doesn't take a ton of time and a great deal of luck and timing.   The benefits help move things along.\n\nAnd because I have been able to attract the occassional younger woman away from the SB world, I can convince myself that any SB is genuinely into me, even if she is just faking it.  As long as she fakes it well.   \n\nThe only reason I would think you would want to use Tinder, would be you don't want to put yourself out there on SA.  Since you are there, I would just stay there.  At least those of us on there, should know the purpose of the site.  (Obviously that doesn't always happen).",

Someone actually enjoy sex. Some women actually like older guys. Some women actually date older guys, and some even fall in love with them. Just step on over into r/agegaps and take a look at all really young girls in love with guys 20, 30 or 40 years older, and aren't getting an allowance.

Some would feel guilty taking money, some don't want the feeling of owing someone else (even if I insist it's a gift), some like the girl above don't want to feel like they are being paid to have sex etc. It's not a universal sentiment that if someone offers money people will always take it. It very much depends on how and when the topic comes up. (Of course the pool of younger girls seeking vanilla with older men is not huge, but there are some. Most are probably opening their age range in order to find an SR, but not all.)\n\nAs soon as it moves away from straight up cash though, vanilla people open up way more to it. Like if I offered to buy them something nice we see when we're outside, or on a vacation etc then most would be ok with that. But I probably couldn't open up with that as it could come off weird/desperate or like a scam or car salesman-y. It's gotta come up later and feel genuinely like I'm offering it as a gift / because I can afford to and not as a way to compensate them for being with me.",

Some would feel guilty taking money, some don't want the feeling of owing someone else (even if I insist it's a gift), some like the girl above don't want to feel like they are being paid to have sex etc. It's not a universal sentiment that if someone offers money people will always take it. It very much depends on how and when the topic comes up. (Of course the pool of younger girls seeking vanilla with older men is not huge, but there are some. Most are probably opening their age range in order to find an SR, but not all.)\n\nAs soon as it moves away from straight up cash though, vanilla people open up way more to it. Like if I offered to buy them something nice we see when we're outside, or on a vacation etc then most would be ok with that. But I probably couldn't open up with that as it could come off weird/desperate or like a scam or car salesman-y. It's gotta come up later and feel genuinely like I'm offering it as a gift / because I can afford to and not as a way to compensate them for being with me.",

Some would feel guilty taking money, some don't want the feeling of owing someone else (even if I insist it's a gift), some like the girl above don't want to feel like they are being paid to have sex etc. It's not a universal sentiment that if someone offers money people will always take it. It very much depends on how and when the topic comes up. (Of course the pool of younger girls seeking vanilla with older men is not huge, but there are some. Most are probably opening their age range in order to find an SR, but not all.)\n\nAs soon as it moves away from straight up cash though, vanilla people open up way more to it. Like if I offered to buy them something nice we see when we're outside, or on a vacation etc then most would be ok with that. But I probably couldn't open up with that as it could come off weird/desperate or like a scam or car salesman-y. It's gotta come up later and feel genuinely like I'm offering it as a gift / because I can afford to and not as a way to compensate them for being with me.",

Some would feel guilty taking money, some don't want the feeling of owing someone else (even if I insist it's a gift), some like the girl above don't want to feel like they are being paid to have sex etc. It's not a universal sentiment that if someone offers money people will always take it. It very much depends on how and when the topic comes up. (Of course the pool of younger girls seeking vanilla with older men is not huge, but there are some. Most are probably opening their age range in order to find an SR, but not all.)\n\nAs soon as it moves away from straight up cash though, vanilla people open up way more to it. Like if I offered to buy them something nice we see when we're outside, or on a vacation etc then most would be ok with that. But I probably couldn't open up with that as it could come off weird/desperate or like a scam or car salesman-y. It's gotta come up later and feel genuinely like I'm offering it as a gift / because I can afford to and not as a way to compensate them for being with me.",
