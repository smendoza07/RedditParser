We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

But what Kurenai did in that fight was just utter stupidity. Sharingan doesn\u2019t actually power up taijutsu as much as you think. It enhances reaction time. Sasuke had to train for two months to bring his speed up to Rock Lee. By saying that the sharingan is as much as a taijutsu weapon as it is a genjutsu weapon would be like saying that Itachi could match Gai in a taijutsu fight. That\u2019s not how taijutsu works.",

That's her talent that she sunk most of her time and effort into training - what else was she supposed to do in this situation? Sure, obviously we all know Itachi was hella dangerous with Genjutsu but the fight was inevitable at that stage and she had to do something, so really she just had to work with what she was good at and hope it'd be enough.\n\nIt's like a coach saying to a boxer \"don't bother trying to punch the other guy, he's a better boxer than you\". \n\n\"We're fighting right now coach! I don't really have a choice!\"\n\nMaybe if she tried to take on Kisame instead things might not have went SO poorly for her, but it's hard to say. Maybe Kisame could have escaped, maybe Itachi would have blitzed Asuma and jumped in to help Kisame - maybe, maybe, maybe...\n\nEither way, there's not many who would throw down with Itachi - she did the best she could with what she had against an S-Rank ninja who is so powerful people have legit argued he could beat Madara, Juubito, all the Kage etc...",

Obito has an incredible OP MS, the Kamui is indeed hard to counter, but that doesn't garantee a win.\n\nImo the guys that could make him sweat were Sage Mode Jiraya, Guy (with the gates wide open), Kisame and Gaara.",

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

If I were Kurenai, I would know absolutely nothing about Itachi except for the fact that he slaughtered the Uchiha clan. (Btw they engaged Itachi bc they knew he killed the Uchiha) Meaning he has to be a master sharingan user. No knowledge of Mangekyou, no tsukuyomi, no susanoo, no amaterasu. But I would know not to directly try genjutsu bc I would be hard countered. Yeah I agree my method won\u2019t give a better outcome, but it would 100% be the better move to do.\nI think one of the first things Kakashi taught Naruto was \u201cThink before you use a jutsu\u201d when Kakashi did substitution against Natuto\u2019s shadow clones. After that, Naruto mostly used shadow clones in the beginning to figure out the opponent\u2019s abilities unless he was unhinged. \n\nI think at this point, you\u2019re trying to argue that there was nothing Kurenai could do to better the outcome. I\u2019m agreeing with you on that. But I\u2019m trying to argue that as a Konoha Jonin, a direct move without any knowledge of your enemies, is a stupid move. But the fact that the one on the left is genjutsu-proof and you attack with a genjutsu while he\u2019s looking at you while you weave a sign makes it even dumber.",

I mean yeah, she tried to pull one over on THE Itachi Motherfucking Uchiha himself, but she's a genjutsu specialist so well known for her craft she's widely known as \"Konoha's Genjutsu Mistress\". That's her talent that she sunk most of her time and effort into training - what else was she supposed to do in this situation? Sure, obviously we all know Itachi was hella dangerous with Genjutsu but the fight was inevitable at that stage and she had to do something, so really she just had to work with what she was good at and hope it'd be enough.\n\nIt's like a coach saying to a boxer \"don't bother trying to punch the other guy, he's a better boxer than you\". \n\n\"We're fighting right now coach! I don't really have a choice!\"\n\nMaybe if she tried to take on Kisame instead things might not have went SO poorly for her, but it's hard to say. Maybe Kisame could have escaped, maybe Itachi would have blitzed Asuma and jumped in to help Kisame - maybe, maybe, maybe...\n\nEither way, there's not many who would throw down with Itachi - she did the best she could with what she had against an S-Rank ninja who is so powerful people have legit argued he could beat Madara, Juubito, all the Kage etc...",

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

In any fight, your best move isn\u2019t to jump in and use your specialty attack especially when outmatched. It\u2019s to see the situation and do the best thing in that situation. Kurenai literally stood there, looked at Itachi and Kisame and did her genjutsu on Itachi. Idk what you call this besides a royal fuck up. So she should have hid, tried to separate Itachi and Kisame with the help of Asuma and then tried putting Kisame to genjutsu.

If Kurenai used Taijutsu she still would\u2019ve lost. Same goes for Asuma.

If your specialty is genjutsu and trickery, you better be staying back and let Asuma lead while you look for an opening. With that said, they probably wouldn\u2019t have won either way. But what Kurenai did in that fight was just utter stupidity. Sharingan doesn\u2019t actually power up taijutsu as much as you think. It enhances reaction time. Sasuke had to train for two months to bring his speed up to Rock Lee. By saying that the sharingan is as much as a taijutsu weapon as it is a genjutsu weapon would be like saying that Itachi could match Gai in a taijutsu fight. That\u2019s not how taijutsu works.",

But I would know not to directly try genjutsu bc I would be hard countered. Yeah I agree my method won\u2019t give a better outcome, but it would 100% be the better move to do.\nI think one of the first things Kakashi taught Naruto was \u201cThink before you use a jutsu\u201d when Kakashi did substitution against Natuto\u2019s shadow clones. After that, Naruto mostly used shadow clones in the beginning to figure out the opponent\u2019s abilities unless he was unhinged. \n\nI think at this point, you\u2019re trying to argue that there was nothing Kurenai could do to better the outcome. I\u2019m agreeing with you on that. But I\u2019m trying to argue that as a Konoha Jonin, a direct move without any knowledge of your enemies, is a stupid move.

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

(Btw they engaged Itachi bc they knew he killed the Uchiha) Meaning he has to be a master sharingan user. No knowledge of Mangekyou, no tsukuyomi, no susanoo, no amaterasu. But I would know not to directly try genjutsu bc I would be hard countered. Yeah I agree my method won\u2019t give a better outcome, but it would 100% be the better move to do.\nI think one of the first things Kakashi taught Naruto was \u201cThink before you use a jutsu\u201d when Kakashi did substitution against Natuto\u2019s shadow clones. After that, Naruto mostly used shadow clones in the beginning to figure out the opponent\u2019s abilities unless he was unhinged. \n\nI think at this point, you\u2019re trying to argue that there was nothing Kurenai could do to better the outcome. I\u2019m agreeing with you on that. But I\u2019m trying to argue that as a Konoha Jonin, a direct move without any knowledge of your enemies, is a stupid move. But the fact that the one on the left is genjutsu-proof and you attack with a genjutsu while he\u2019s looking at you while you weave a sign makes it even dumber.",

He's a perfect jinchuriki too. \n\nYou don't remember Obito getting info from Konan?",

Obito has an incredible OP MS, the Kamui is indeed hard to counter, but that doesn't garantee a win.\n\nImo the guys that could make him sweat were Sage Mode Jiraya, Guy (with the gates wide open), Kisame and Gaara.",

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

If I were Kurenai, I would know absolutely nothing about Itachi except for the fact that he slaughtered the Uchiha clan. (Btw they engaged Itachi bc they knew he killed the Uchiha) Meaning he has to be a master sharingan user. No knowledge of Mangekyou, no tsukuyomi, no susanoo, no amaterasu. But I would know not to directly try genjutsu bc I would be hard countered. Yeah I agree my method won\u2019t give a better outcome, but it would 100% be the better move to do.\nI think one of the first things Kakashi taught Naruto was \u201cThink before you use a jutsu\u201d when Kakashi did substitution against Natuto\u2019s shadow clones. After that, Naruto mostly used shadow clones in the beginning to figure out the opponent\u2019s abilities unless he was unhinged. \n\nI think at this point, you\u2019re trying to argue that there was nothing Kurenai could do to better the outcome. I\u2019m agreeing with you on that. But I\u2019m trying to argue that as a Konoha Jonin, a direct move without any knowledge of your enemies, is a stupid move.

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

But what Kurenai did in that fight was just utter stupidity. Sharingan doesn\u2019t actually power up taijutsu as much as you think. It enhances reaction time. Sasuke had to train for two months to bring his speed up to Rock Lee. By saying that the sharingan is as much as a taijutsu weapon as it is a genjutsu weapon would be like saying that Itachi could match Gai in a taijutsu fight. That\u2019s not how taijutsu works.",

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

But what Kurenai did in that fight was just utter stupidity. Sharingan doesn\u2019t actually power up taijutsu as much as you think. It enhances reaction time. Sasuke had to train for two months to bring his speed up to Rock Lee. By saying that the sharingan is as much as a taijutsu weapon as it is a genjutsu weapon would be like saying that Itachi could match Gai in a taijutsu fight. That\u2019s not how taijutsu works.",

We never heard of Jiraiya actually coming in contact with the Akatsuki until that incident I mentioned above and the Pain fight, so it also adds that Itachi helped him via genjutsus. Cuz think about it, the Akatsuki are very high skilled, and they could probably catch on to anyone spying on them for a while via chakra sensory. Plus Itachi had some secret access to Konoha, yet only 2 people to report to, 1 of which died somewhat early on, and the other who was still hella shady and didn't even bother reporting everything to the Hokage. Thus Jiraiya could potentially be the third spy he informed to make sure Konoha was properly protected",

He is obviously in the class of people who could do it. He also likely knows much more about Itachi and his abilities than Itachi knows of him, so that is an advantage.",

If I were Kurenai, I would know absolutely nothing about Itachi except for the fact that he slaughtered the Uchiha clan. (Btw they engaged Itachi bc they knew he killed the Uchiha) Meaning he has to be a master sharingan user. No knowledge of Mangekyou, no tsukuyomi, no susanoo, no amaterasu. But I would know not to directly try genjutsu bc I would be hard countered. Yeah I agree my method won\u2019t give a better outcome, but it would 100% be the better move to do.\nI think one of the first things Kakashi taught Naruto was \u201cThink before you use a jutsu\u201d when Kakashi did substitution against Natuto\u2019s shadow clones. After that, Naruto mostly used shadow clones in the beginning to figure out the opponent\u2019s abilities unless he was unhinged. \n\nI think at this point, you\u2019re trying to argue that there was nothing Kurenai could do to better the outcome. I\u2019m agreeing with you on that. But I\u2019m trying to argue that as a Konoha Jonin, a direct move without any knowledge of your enemies, is a stupid move. But the fact that the one on the left is genjutsu-proof and you attack with a genjutsu while he\u2019s looking at you while you weave a sign makes it even dumber.",
