    "body": "Being a member of this page has (for some reason) given random men the desire/empowerment to DM hate. Any other sugar babies experiencing the same type of crap? I do not understand why I am receiving the hate that I am inboxed with -- calling me horrid names, having presumptions of my life, etc. Bottom line: To the men who look at these threads and go out of their way to send hate to women; let it be known, you are alone and will most likely die alone with that hatred! :)  \nThanks for coming to my TedTalk and have a nice day.",
