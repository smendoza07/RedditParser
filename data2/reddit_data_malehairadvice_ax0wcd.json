I recommend something like [THIS](https://juanestebanrios.com/wp-content/uploads/fade-haircut-black-20-fade-haircuts-for-black-men-3.jpg) . Keep the length up top and let it grow a little longer, also have him tighten up the goatee and sharpen it up like in the picture. Good luck. Big tip: talk to your barber for a while before he starts cutting to make sure he knows what you want and you guys agree on how it should look.  Also: find more pictures of styles you like, that\u2019ll be super helpful for your barber.",

(Head over to r/curlyhair for that). Also, I would like to see your beard become a thick but trimmed mustache and possibly a patch on your chin, cut the sides is all I'm saying. The facial hair of Michal B Jorden is what I'm imaging. Or go for a full beard around 1-2 inches faded into your taper and leave the hair on your chin about 2-3cm's longer on for a more slimming effect.  \n\n\nGetting an eyebrow waxing could also help to slim and add complementary angles to your face.",
